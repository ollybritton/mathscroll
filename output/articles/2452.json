{"title":"Ceva's theorem","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, Ceva's theorem is a theorem about triangles. Given a triangle △ABC, let the lines AO, BO, CO be drawn from the vertices to a common point O (not on one of the sides of △ABC), to meet opposite sides at D, E, F respectively. (The segments AD, BE, CF are known as cevians.) Then, using signed lengths of segments,","image":"96e441c8416c9b1612115f0bcf576872cee58a2b.svg","url":"Ceva's_theorem"}
