{"title":"Partition (number theory)","summary":"In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition. (If order matters, the sum becomes a composition.)  For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:","image":"Ferrer_partitioning_diagrams.svg.png.webp","url":"Partition_(number_theory)"}
