{"title":"Discharging method (discrete mathematics)","summary":"The discharging method is a technique used to prove lemmas in structural graph theory.[1]  Discharging is most well known for its central role in the proof of the four color theorem.  The discharging method is used to prove that every graph in a certain class contains some subgraph from a specified list.  The presence of the desired subgraph is then often used to prove a coloring result.[1]","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Discharging_method_(discrete_mathematics)"}
