{"title":"Killing horizon","summary":"In physics, a Killing horizon is a geometrical construct used in general relativity and its generalizations to delineate spacetime boundaries without reference to the dynamic Einstein field equations. Mathematically a Killing horizon is a null hypersurface defined by the vanishing of the norm of a Killing vector field (both are named after Wilhelm Killing).[1] It can also be defined as a null hypersurface generated by a Killing vector, which in turn is null at that surface.","image":"899eb4e1d2776847a8a39f5a9e0354b2e1383c80.svg","url":"Killing_horizon"}
