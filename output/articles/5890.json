{"title":"G-fibration","summary":"In algebraic topology, a G-fibration or principal fibration is a generalization of a principal G-bundle, just as a fibration is a generalization of a fiber bundle. By definition,[1] given a topological monoid G, a G-fibration is a fibration p: P→B together with a continuous right monoid action P × G → P such that","image":"a1c039313e50068a57da0a30f91084d8ca244bff.svg","url":"G-fibration"}
