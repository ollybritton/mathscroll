{"title":"Markovian arrival process","summary":"In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, a Markovian arrival process (MAP or MArP[1]) is a mathematical model for the time between job arrivals to a system. The simplest such process is a Poisson process where the time between each arrival is exponentially distributed.[2][3]","image":"769a6161830d69ecf7874384993f80891893db4b.svg","url":"Markovian_arrival_process"}
