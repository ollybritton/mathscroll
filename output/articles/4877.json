{"title":"Envy-freeness","summary":"Envy-freeness, also known as no-envy, is a criterion for fair division. It says that, when resources are allocated among people with equal rights, each person should receive a share that is, in their eyes, at least as good as the share received by any other agent. In other words, no person should feel envy.","image":"add78d8608ad86e54951b8c8bd6c8d8416533d20.svg","url":"Envy-freeness"}
