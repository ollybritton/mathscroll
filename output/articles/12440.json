{"title":"Power sum symmetric polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in commutative algebra, the power sum symmetric polynomials are a type of basic building block for symmetric polynomials, in the sense that every symmetric polynomial with rational coefficients can be expressed as a sum and difference of products of power sum symmetric polynomials with rational coefficients.  However, not every symmetric polynomial with integral coefficients is generated by integral combinations of products of power-sum polynomials: they are a generating set over the rationals, but not over the integers.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Power_sum_symmetric_polynomial"}
