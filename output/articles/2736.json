{"title":"Clausius–Mossotti relation","summary":"The Clausius–Mossotti relation expresses the dielectric constant (relative permittivity, εr) of a material in terms of the atomic polarizability, α, of the material's constituent atoms and/or molecules, or a homogeneous mixture thereof. It is named after Ottaviano-Fabrizio Mossotti and Rudolf Clausius. It is equivalent to the  Lorentz–Lorenz equation. It may be expressed as:[1][2]","image":"717045df4fd423aed5ad2822f29fa112447d989a.svg","url":"Clausius–Mossotti_relation"}
