{"title":"(a, b)-decomposition","summary":"In graph theory, the (a, b)-decomposition of an undirected graph is a partition of its edges into a + 1 sets, each one of them inducing a forest, except one which induces a graph with maximum degree b. If this graph is also a forest, then we call this a  F(a, b)-decomposition.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"(a,_b)-decomposition"}
