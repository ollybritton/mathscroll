{"title":"JLO cocycle","summary":"In noncommutative geometry, the JLO cocycle is a cocycle (and thus defines a cohomology class) in entire cyclic cohomology. It is a non-commutative version of the classic Chern character of the conventional differential geometry. In noncommutative geometry, the concept of a manifold is replaced by a noncommutative algebra A {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}} of \"functions\" on the putative noncommutative space. The cyclic cohomology of the algebra A {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}} contains the information about the topology of that noncommutative space, very much as the de Rham cohomology contains the information about the topology of a conventional manifold.","image":"280ae03440942ab348c2ca9b8db6b56ffa9618f8.svg","url":"JLO_cocycle"}
