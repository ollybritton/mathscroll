{"title":"Biorthogonal polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, a biorthogonal polynomial is a polynomial that is orthogonal to several different measures. Biorthogonal polynomials are a generalization of orthogonal polynomials and share many of their properties. There are two different concepts of biorthogonal polynomials in the literature: Iserles & Nørsett (1988) introduced the concept of polynomials biorthogonal with respect to a sequence of measures, while Szegő introduced the concept of two sequences of polynomials that are biorthogonal with respect to each other.","image":"19923eb88e0d3dd17d5b44a5d6921578efb5582d.svg","url":"Biorthogonal_polynomial"}
