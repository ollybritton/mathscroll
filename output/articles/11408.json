{"title":"One-relator group","summary":"In the mathematical subject of group theory, a one-relator group is a group given by a group presentation with a single defining relation. One-relator groups play an important role in geometric group theory by providing many explicit examples of finitely presented groups.","image":"ea0d543d1aeaddcaf25cf02f2952ae48065dc1de.svg","url":"One-relator_group"}
