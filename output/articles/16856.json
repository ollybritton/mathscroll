{"title":"Weyl character formula","summary":"In mathematics, the Weyl character formula in representation theory describes the characters of irreducible representations of compact Lie groups in terms of their highest weights.[1] It was proved by  Hermann WeylÂ (1925, 1926a, 1926b). There is a closely related formula for the character of an irreducible representation of a semisimple Lie algebra.[2] In Weyl's approach to the representation theory of connected compact Lie groups, the proof of the character formula is a key step in proving that every dominant integral element actually arises as the highest weight of some irreducible representation.[3] Important consequences of the character formula are the Weyl dimension formula and the Kostant multiplicity formula.","image":"656111758322ace96d80a9371771aa6d3de25437.svg","url":"Weyl_character_formula"}
