{"title":"Bayes linear statistics","summary":"Bayes linear statistics is a subjectivist statistical methodology and framework.  Traditional subjective Bayesian analysis is based upon fully specified probability distributions, which are very difficult to specify at the necessary level of detail.  Bayes linear analysis attempts to solve this problem by developing theory and practise for using partially specified probability models.  Bayes linear in its current form has been primarily developed by Michael Goldstein.  Mathematically and philosophically it extends Bruno de Finetti's Operational Subjective approach to probability and statistics.","image":"4d765604bbe739e52b251ab51de120c031b56bee.svg","url":"Bayes_linear_statistics"}
