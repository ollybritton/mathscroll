{"title":"Atomic sentence","summary":"In logic and analytic philosophy, an atomic sentence is a type of declarative sentence which is either true or false (may also be referred to as a proposition, statement or truthbearer) and which cannot be broken down into other simpler sentences. For example, \"The dog ran\" is an atomic sentence in natural language, whereas \"The dog ran and the cat hid\" is a molecular sentence in natural language.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Atomic_sentence"}
