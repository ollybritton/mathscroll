{"title":"Chordal graph","summary":"In the mathematical area of graph theory, a chordal graph is one in which all cycles of four or more vertices have a chord, which is an edge that is not part of the cycle but connects two vertices of the cycle. Equivalently, every induced cycle in the graph should have exactly three vertices. The chordal graphs may also be characterized as the graphs that have perfect elimination orderings, as the graphs in which each minimal separator is a clique, and as the intersection graphs of subtrees of a tree.  They are sometimes also called rigid circuit graphs[1] or  triangulated graphs.[2]","image":"Chordal-graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Chordal_graph"}
