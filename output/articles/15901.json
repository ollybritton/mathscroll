{"title":"Torus action","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a torus action on an algebraic variety is a group action of an algebraic torus on the variety. A variety equipped with an action of a torus T is called a T-variety. In differential geometry, one considers an action of a real or complex torus on a manifold (or an orbifold).","image":"c9cb3da43189a2b23ba3c33751e7ebac181961f6.svg","url":"Torus_action"}
