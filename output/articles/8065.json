{"title":"Isolated point","summary":"In mathematics, a point x is called an isolated point of a subset S (in a topological space X) if x is an element of S and there exists a neighborhood of x that does not contain any other points of S. This is equivalent to saying that the singleton {x}  is an open set in the topological space S (considered as a subspace of X). Another equivalent formulation is: an element x of S is an isolated point of S if and only if it is not a limit point of S.","image":"Điểm_cô_lập-Isolated_point.svg.png.webp","url":"Isolated_point"}
