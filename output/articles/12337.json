{"title":"Polynomial chaos","summary":"Polynomial chaos (PC), also called polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and Wiener chaos expansion, is a method for representing a random variable in terms of a polynomial function of other random variables. The polynomials are chosen to be orthogonal with respect to the joint probability distribution of these random variables. PCE can be used, e.g., to determine the evolution of uncertainty in a dynamical system when there is probabilistic uncertainty in the system parameters. Note that despite its name, PCE has no immediate connections to chaos theory.[1]","image":"961d67d6b454b4df2301ac571808a3538b3a6d3f.svg","url":"Polynomial_chaos"}
