{"title":"Bertrand–Diguet–Puiseux theorem","summary":"In the mathematical study of the differential geometry of surfaces, the Bertrand–Diguet–Puiseux theorem expresses the Gaussian curvature of a surface in terms of the circumference of a geodesic circle, or the area of a geodesic disc.  The theorem is named for Joseph Bertrand, Victor Puiseux, and Charles François Diguet.","image":"1c41a70ffee14d5dccc203ef071d73cb20c68a70.svg","url":"Bertrand–Diguet–Puiseux_theorem"}
