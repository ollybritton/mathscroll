{"title":"Pseudocompact space","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of topology, a topological space is said to be pseudocompact if its image under any continuous function to R is bounded. Many authors include the requirement that the space be completely regular in the definition of pseudocompactness. Pseudocompact spaces were defined by Edwin Hewitt in 1948.[1]","image":"721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1.svg","url":"Pseudocompact_space"}
