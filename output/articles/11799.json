{"title":"Parametric programming","summary":"Parametric programming is a type of mathematical optimization, where the optimization problem is solved as a function of one or multiple parameters.[1] Developed in parallel to sensitivity analysis, its earliest mention can be found in a thesis from 1952.[2] Since then, there have been considerable developments for the cases of multiple parameters, presence of integer variables as well as nonlinearities.","image":"ad3805a5809df6e2e34052a1505f5378be55ace9.svg","url":"Parametric_programming"}
