{"title":"Waldhausen category","summary":"In mathematics, a Waldhausen category is a category C equipped with some additional data, which makes it possible to construct the K-theory spectrum of C using a so-called S-construction. It's named after Friedhelm Waldhausen, who introduced this notion (under the term category with cofibrations and weak equivalences) to extend the methods of algebraic K-theory to categories not necessarily of algebraic origin, for example the category of topological spaces.","image":"957ad34a9ba984bc7963ae8c01ceda905ae31085.svg","url":"Waldhausen_category"}
