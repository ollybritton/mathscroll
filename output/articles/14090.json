{"title":"Self-oscillation","summary":"Self-oscillation is the generation and maintenance of a periodic motion by a source of power that lacks any corresponding periodicity. The oscillator itself controls the phase with which the external power acts on it. Self-oscillators are therefore distinct from forced and parametric resonators, in which the power that sustains the motion must be modulated externally.","image":"Self_excited_oscillation.svg.png.webp","url":"Self-oscillation"}
