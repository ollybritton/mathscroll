{"title":"Loewner order","summary":"In mathematics, Loewner order is the partial order defined by the convex cone of positive semi-definite matrices. This order is usually employed to generalize the definitions of monotone and concave/convex scalar functions to monotone and concave/convex Hermitian valued functions. These functions arise naturally in matrix and operator theory and have applications in many areas of physics and engineering.","image":"48b3645bec447dc66d259d83b7194e9a8162aa1d.svg","url":"Loewner_order"}
