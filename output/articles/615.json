{"title":"Algebraic topology","summary":"Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.","image":"Torus.png.webp","url":"Algebraic_topology"}
