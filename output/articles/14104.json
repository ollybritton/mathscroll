{"title":"Semi-implicit Euler method","summary":"In mathematics, the semi-implicit Euler method, also called symplectic Euler, semi-explicit Euler, Euler–Cromer, and Newton–Størmer–Verlet (NSV), is a modification of the Euler method for solving Hamilton's equations, a system of ordinary differential equations that arises in classical mechanics. It is a symplectic integrator and hence it yields better results than the standard Euler method.","image":"be53a936a69b757d54a31081e949017f6de03640.svg","url":"Semi-implicit_Euler_method"}
