{"title":"Lattice disjoint","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, two elements x and y of a vector lattice X are lattice disjoint or simply disjoint if inf { | x | , | y | } = 0 {\\displaystyle \\inf \\left\\{|x|,|y|\\right\\}=0} , in which case we write x ⊥ y {\\displaystyle x\\perp y} , where the absolute value of x is defined to be | x | := sup { x , − x } {\\displaystyle |x|:=\\sup \\left\\{x,-x\\right\\}} .[1] We say that two sets A and B are lattice disjoint or disjoint if a and b are disjoint for all a in A and all b in B, in which case we write A ⊥ B {\\displaystyle A\\perp B} .[2] If A is the singleton set { a } {\\displaystyle \\{a\\}} then we will write a ⊥ B {\\displaystyle a\\perp B} in place of { a } ⊥ B {\\displaystyle \\{a\\}\\perp B} . For any set A, we define the disjoint complement to be the set A ⊥ := { x ∈ X : x ⊥ A } {\\displaystyle A^{\\perp }:=\\left\\{x\\in X:x\\perp A\\right\\}} .[2]","image":"d93c711808696c3e92656f6c42c23c682dc0ba26.svg","url":"Lattice_disjoint"}
