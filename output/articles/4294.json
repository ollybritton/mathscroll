{"title":"Distance-hereditary graph","summary":"In graph theory, a branch of discrete mathematics, a distance-hereditary graph (also called a completely separable graph)[1] is a graph in which the distances in any connected induced subgraph are the same as they are in the original graph. Thus, any induced subgraph inherits the distances of the larger graph.","image":"Distance-hereditary_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Distance-hereditary_graph"}
