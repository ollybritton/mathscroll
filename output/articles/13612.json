{"title":"Rng (algebra)","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, a rng (or non-unital ring or pseudo-ring) is an algebraic structure satisfying the same properties as a ring, but without assuming the existence of a multiplicative identity. The term rng (IPA: /rʊŋ/) is meant to suggest that it is a ring without i, that is, without the requirement for an identity element.","image":"44300e6e9d83e5be5ae1c5d35f4a74cdf161eb28.svg","url":"Rng_(algebra)"}
