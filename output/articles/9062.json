{"title":"Lattice of subgroups","summary":"In mathematics, the lattice of subgroups of a group G {\\displaystyle G} is the lattice whose elements are the subgroups of G {\\displaystyle G} , with the partial order relation being set inclusion. In this lattice, the join of two subgroups is the subgroup generated by their union, and the meet of two subgroups is their intersection.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Lattice_of_subgroups"}
