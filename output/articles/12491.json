{"title":"Prime number theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the prime number theorem (PNT) describes the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers among the positive integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs.  The theorem was proved independently by Jacques Hadamard[1] and Charles Jean de la Vall√©e Poussin[2] in 1896 using ideas introduced by Bernhard Riemann (in particular, the Riemann zeta function).","image":"Prime_number_theorem_ratio_convergence.svg.png.webp","url":"Prime_number_theorem"}
