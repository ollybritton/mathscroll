{"title":"Planar projection","summary":"Planar projections are the subset of 3D graphical projections constructed by linearly mapping points in three-dimensional space to points on a two-dimensional projection plane. The projected point on the plane is chosen such that it is collinear with the corresponding three-dimensional point and the centre of projection. The lines connecting these points are commonly referred to as projectors.","image":"Axonometric_projection.svg.png.webp","url":"Planar_projection"}
