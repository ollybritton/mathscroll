{"title":"Donaldson–Thomas theory","summary":"In mathematics, specifically algebraic geometry, Donaldson–Thomas theory is the theory of Donaldson–Thomas invariants.   Given a compact moduli space of sheaves on a Calabi–Yau threefold, its Donaldson–Thomas invariant is the virtual number of its points, i.e., the integral of the cohomology class 1 against the virtual fundamental class.  The Donaldson–Thomas invariant is a holomorphic analogue of the Casson invariant.  The invariants were introduced by Simon Donaldson and Richard Thomas (1998). Donaldson–Thomas invariants have close connections to Gromov–Witten invariants of algebraic three-folds and the theory of stable pairs due to Rahul Pandharipande and Thomas.","image":"Calabi_yau_formatted.svg.png.webp","url":"Donaldson–Thomas_theory"}
