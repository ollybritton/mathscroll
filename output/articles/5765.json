{"title":"Frobenius endomorphism","summary":"In commutative algebra and field theory, the Frobenius endomorphism (after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius) is a special endomorphism of commutative rings with prime characteristic p, an important class which includes finite fields. The endomorphism maps every element to its p-th power. In certain contexts it is an automorphism, but this is not true in general.","image":"5188b35673c10ffd81bbd1abda0ae414336cd1bc.svg","url":"Frobenius_endomorphism"}
