{"title":"Teichmüller space","summary":"In mathematics, the Teichmüller space T ( S ) {\\displaystyle T(S)} of a (real) topological (or differential) surface S {\\displaystyle S} , is a space that parametrizes complex structures on S {\\displaystyle S} up to the action of homeomorphisms that are isotopic to the identity homeomorphism. Teichmüller spaces are named after Oswald Teichmüller.","image":"b8130fcf653a6e31ed279497f270cedbf6158d3c.svg","url":"Teichmüller_space"}
