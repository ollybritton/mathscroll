{"title":"Simply typed lambda calculus","summary":"The simply typed lambda calculus ( λ → {\\displaystyle \\lambda ^{\\to }} ), a form of type theory, is a typed interpretation of the lambda calculus with only one type constructor ( → {\\displaystyle \\to } ) that builds function types. It is the canonical and simplest example of a typed lambda calculus.  The simply typed lambda calculus was originally introduced by Alonzo Church in 1940 as an attempt to avoid paradoxical use of the untyped lambda calculus.[1]","image":"f622e45d27687fa0d4e14f98ab7a8fef03f273a2.svg","url":"Simply_typed_lambda_calculus"}
