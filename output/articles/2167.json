{"title":"Canonical normal form","summary":"In Boolean algebra, any Boolean function can be expressed in the canonical disjunctive normal form (CDNF)[1] or minterm canonical form and its dual canonical conjunctive normal form (CCNF) or maxterm canonical form.  Other canonical forms include the complete sum of prime implicants or Blake canonical form (and its dual), and the algebraic normal form  (also called Zhegalkin or Reedâ€“Muller).","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Canonical_normal_form"}
