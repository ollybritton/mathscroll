{"title":"Strength of a graph","summary":"In the branch of mathematics called graph theory, the strength of an undirected graph corresponds to the minimum ratio edges removed/components created in a decomposition of the graph in question. It is a method to compute partitions of the set of vertices and detect zones of high concentration of edges, and is analogous to graph toughness which is defined similarly for vertex removal.","image":"Force-wiki.jpg.webp","url":"Strength_of_a_graph"}
