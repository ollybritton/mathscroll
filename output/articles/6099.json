{"title":"Generating set of a module","summary":"In mathematics, a generating set Γ of a module M over a ring R is a subset of M such that the smallest submodule of M containing Γ is M itself (the smallest submodule containing a subset is the intersection of all submodules containing the set). The set Γ is then said to generate M. For example, the ring R is generated by the identity element 1 as a left R-module over itself. If there is a finite generating set, then a module is said to be finitely generated.","image":"e79eb8d982a623ad54cf6b934683581ddd75ccdf.svg","url":"Generating_set_of_a_module"}
