{"title":"Compact operator on Hilbert space","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of functional analysis, the concept of a compact operator on Hilbert space is an extension of the concept of a matrix acting on a finite-dimensional vector space; in Hilbert space, compact operators are precisely the closure of finite-rank operators (representable by finite-dimensional matrices) in the topology induced by the operator norm. As such, results from matrix theory can sometimes be extended to compact operators using similar arguments. By contrast, the study of general operators on infinite-dimensional spaces often requires a genuinely different approach.","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Compact_operator_on_Hilbert_space"}
