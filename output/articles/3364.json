{"title":"Convergence group","summary":"In mathematics, a convergence group or a discrete convergence group is a group Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } acting by homeomorphisms on a compact metrizable space M {\\displaystyle M} in a way that generalizes the properties of the action of Kleinian group by Möbius transformations on the ideal boundary S 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {S} ^{2}} of the hyperbolic 3-space H 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} ^{3}} . The notion of a convergence group was introduced by Gehring and Martin (1987) [1] and has since found wide applications in geometric topology, quasiconformal analysis, and geometric group theory.","image":"4cfde86a3f7ec967af9955d0988592f0693d2b19.svg","url":"Convergence_group"}
