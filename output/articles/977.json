{"title":"Arithmetic dynamics","summary":"Arithmetic dynamics[1] is a field that amalgamates two areas of mathematics, dynamical systems and number theory. Classically, discrete dynamics refers to the study of the iteration of self-maps of the complex plane or real line. Arithmetic dynamics is the study of the number-theoretic properties of integer, rational, p-adic, and/or algebraic points under repeated application of a polynomial or rational function. A fundamental goal is to describe arithmetic properties in terms of underlying geometric structures.","image":"6268423aae5378d56051edb53cf95d34a9157ae8.svg","url":"Arithmetic_dynamics"}
