{"title":"Topological tensor product","summary":"In mathematics, there are usually many different ways to construct a topological tensor product of two topological vector spaces. For Hilbert spaces or nuclear spaces there is a simple well-behaved theory of tensor products (see Tensor product of Hilbert spaces), but for general Banach spaces or locally convex topological vector spaces the theory is notoriously subtle.","image":"5da6ca7fb9469c44708e6bc399113d8932b9560d.svg","url":"Topological_tensor_product"}
