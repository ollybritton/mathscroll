{"title":"Van Aubel's theorem","summary":"In plane geometry, Van Aubel's theorem describes a relationship between squares constructed on the sides of a quadrilateral. Starting with a given convex quadrilateral, construct a square, external to the quadrilateral, on each side. Van Aubel's theorem states that the two line segments between the centers of opposite squares are of equal lengths and are at right angles to one another. Another way of saying the same thing is that the center points of the four squares form the vertices of an equidiagonal orthodiagonal quadrilateral.  The theorem is named after Belgian mathematician Henricus Hubertus (Henri) Van Aubel (1830â€“1906), who published it in 1878.[1]","image":"Van-Aubel-theorem_combined.svg.png.webp","url":"Van_Aubel's_theorem"}
