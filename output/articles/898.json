{"title":"Aperiodic set of prototiles","summary":"A set of prototiles is aperiodic if copies of the prototiles can be assembled to create tilings, such that all possible tessellation patterns are non-periodic. The aperiodicity referred to is a property of the particular set of prototiles; the various resulting tilings themselves are just non-periodic.","image":"Fund_un_prim_cell.svg.png.webp","url":"Aperiodic_set_of_prototiles"}
