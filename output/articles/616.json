{"title":"Algebraic torus","summary":"In mathematics, an algebraic torus, where a one dimensional torus is typically denoted by G m {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {G} _{\\mathbf {m} }} , G m {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {G} _{m}} , or T {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {T} } , is a type of commutative affine algebraic group commonly found in projective algebraic geometry and toric geometry. Higher dimensional algebraic tori can be modelled as a product of algebraic groups G m {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {G} _{\\mathbf {m} }} . These groups were named by analogy with the theory of tori in Lie group theory (see Cartan subgroup). For example, over the complex numbers C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } the algebraic torus G m {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {G} _{\\mathbf {m} }} is isomorphic to the group scheme C ∗ = Spec ( C [ t , t − 1 ] ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{*}={\\text{Spec}}(\\mathbb {C} [t,t^{-1}])} , which is the scheme theoretic analogue of the Lie group U ( 1 ) ⊂ C {\\displaystyle U(1)\\subset \\mathbb {C} } . In fact, any G m {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {G} _{\\mathbf {m} }} -action on a complex vector space can be pulled back to a U ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle U(1)} -action from the inclusion U ( 1 ) ⊂ C ∗ {\\displaystyle U(1)\\subset \\mathbb {C} ^{*}} as real manifolds.","image":"48bfe800ab8e300e7710de5f99cc8026671139a2.svg","url":"Algebraic_torus"}
