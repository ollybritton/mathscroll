{"title":"Quasicrystal","summary":"A quasiperiodic crystal, or quasicrystal, is a structure that is ordered but not periodic. A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks translational symmetry.[2] While crystals, according to the classical crystallographic restriction theorem, can possess only two-, three-, four-, and six-fold rotational symmetries, the Bragg diffraction pattern of quasicrystals shows sharp peaks with other symmetry ordersâ€”for instance, five-fold.[3]","image":"Quasicrystal1.jpg.webp","url":"Quasicrystal"}
