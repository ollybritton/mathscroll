{"title":"Poisson-type random measure","summary":"Poisson-type random measures are a family of three random counting measures which are closed under restriction to a subspace, i.e. closed under thinning. They are the only distributions in the canonical non-negative power series family of distributions to possess this property and include the Poisson distribution, negative binomial distribution, and binomial distribution.[1] The PT family of distributions is also known as the Katz family of distributions,[2] the Panjer or (a,b,0) class of distributions[3] and may be retrieved through the Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution.[4]","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Poisson-type_random_measure"}
