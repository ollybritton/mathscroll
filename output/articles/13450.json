{"title":"Reverse mathematics","summary":"Reverse mathematics is a program in mathematical logic that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics.  Its defining method can briefly be described as \"going backwards from the theorems to the axioms\", in contrast to the ordinary mathematical practice of deriving theorems from axioms. It can be conceptualized as sculpting out necessary conditions from sufficient ones.","image":"7869cc2aba37b268552ae3f98559e646c417eb2b.svg","url":"Reverse_mathematics"}
