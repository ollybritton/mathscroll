{"title":"Strang splitting","summary":"Strang splitting is a numerical method for solving differential equations that are decomposable into a sum of differential operators. It is named after Gilbert Strang. It is used to speed up calculation for problems involving operators on very different time scales, for example, chemical reactions in fluid dynamics, and to solve multidimensional partial differential equations by reducing them to a sum of one-dimensional problems.","image":"511bb89320823ba33e45dcac79dae70fa4438e87.svg","url":"Strang_splitting"}
