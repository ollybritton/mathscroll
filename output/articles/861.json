{"title":"Anticommutative property","summary":"In mathematics, anticommutativity is a specific property of some non-commutative mathematical operations. Swapping the position of two arguments of an antisymmetric operation yields a result which is the inverse of the result with unswapped arguments. The notion inverse refers to a group structure on the operation's codomain, possibly with another operation. Subtraction is an anticommutative operation because commuting the operands of a − b gives b − a = −(a − b); for example, 2 − 10 = −(10 − 2) = −8. Another prominent example of an anticommutative operation is the Lie bracket.","image":"96c3298ea9aa77c226be56a7d8515baaa517b90b.svg","url":"Anticommutative_property"}
