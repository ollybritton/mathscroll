{"title":"Fiber bundle","summary":"In mathematics, and particularly topology, a fiber bundle (or, in Commonwealth English: fibre bundle) is a space that is locally a product space, but globally may have a different topological structure. Specifically, the similarity between a space E {\\displaystyle E} and a product space B × F {\\displaystyle B\\times F} is defined using a continuous surjective map, π : E → B , {\\displaystyle \\pi :E\\to B,} that in small regions of E {\\displaystyle E} behaves just like a projection from corresponding regions of B × F {\\displaystyle B\\times F} to B . {\\displaystyle B.} The map π , {\\displaystyle \\pi ,} called the projection or submersion of the bundle, is regarded as part of the structure of the bundle.  The space E {\\displaystyle E} is known as the total space of the fiber bundle, B {\\displaystyle B} as the base space, and F {\\displaystyle F} the fiber.","image":"4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b.svg","url":"Fiber_bundle"}
