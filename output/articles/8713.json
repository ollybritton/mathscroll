{"title":"Kirillov character formula","summary":"In mathematics, for a Lie group G {\\displaystyle G} , the Kirillov orbit method gives a heuristic method in representation theory. It connects the Fourier transforms of coadjoint orbits, which lie in the dual space of the Lie algebra of G, to the infinitesimal characters of the irreducible representations. The method got its name after the Russian mathematician Alexandre Kirillov.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Kirillov_character_formula"}
