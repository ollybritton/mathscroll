{"title":"Well-ordering principle","summary":"In mathematics, the well-ordering principle states that every non-empty set of positive integers contains a least element.[1] In other words, the set of positive integers is well-ordered by its \"natural\" or \"magnitude\" order in which x {\\displaystyle x} precedes y {\\displaystyle y} if and only if y {\\displaystyle y} is either x {\\displaystyle x} or the sum of x {\\displaystyle x} and some positive integer (other orderings include the ordering 2 , 4 , 6 , . . . {\\displaystyle 2,4,6,...} ; and 1 , 3 , 5 , . . . {\\displaystyle 1,3,5,...} ).","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Well-ordering_principle"}
