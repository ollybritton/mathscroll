{"title":"Holomorph (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the area of algebra known as group theory, the holomorph of a group is a group that simultaneously contains (copies of) the group and its automorphism group.  The holomorph provides interesting examples of groups, and allows one to treat group elements and group automorphisms in a uniform context. In group theory, for a group G {\\displaystyle G} , the holomorph of G {\\displaystyle G} denoted Hol ‚Å° ( G ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Hol} (G)} can be described as a semidirect product or as a permutation group.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Holomorph_(mathematics)"}
