{"title":"Computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere","summary":"The computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere is a series of radio propagation models and methods to estimate the path loss due to attenuation of the signal passing through the atmosphere by the absorption of its different components. There are many well-known facts on the phenomenon and qualitative treatments in textbooks.[1] A document published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) [2] provides some basis for a quantitative assessment of the attenuation.  That document describes a simplified model along with semi-empirical formulas based on data fitting.  It also recommended an algorithm to compute the attenuation of radiowave propagation in the atmosphere.  NASA also published a study on a related subject.[3] Free software from CNES based on ITU-R recommendations is available for download and is available to the public.","image":"Optinv.png.webp","url":"Computation_of_radiowave_attenuation_in_the_atmosphere"}
