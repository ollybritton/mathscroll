{"title":"Multi-objective linear programming","summary":"Multi-objective linear programming is a subarea of mathematical optimization. A multiple objective linear program (MOLP) is a linear program with more than one objective function. An MOLP is a special case of a vector linear program. Multi-objective linear programming is also a subarea of Multi-objective optimization.","image":"fc2f7fbab835f70a310dfe0454876ee2fa675396.svg","url":"Multi-objective_linear_programming"}
