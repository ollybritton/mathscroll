{"title":"Circle","summary":"A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre. Equivalently, it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. Usually, the radius is required to be a positive number. A circle with r = 0 {\\displaystyle r=0} (a single point) is a degenerate case. This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.","image":"894a83e863728b4ee2e12f3a999a09f5f2bf1c89.svg","url":"Circle"}
