{"title":"Self-similar solution","summary":"In the study of partial differential equations, particularly in fluid dynamics, a self-similar solution is a form of solution  which is similar to itself if the independent and dependent variables are appropriately scaled. Self-similar solutions appear whenever the problem lacks a characteristic length or time scale (for example, the Blasius boundary layer of an infinite plate, but not of a finite-length plate). These include, for example, the Blasius boundary layer or the Sedovâ€“Taylor shell.[1][2]","image":"c15bbbb971240cf328aba572178f091684585468.svg","url":"Self-similar_solution"}
