{"title":"Linear algebraic group","summary":"In mathematics, a linear algebraic group  is a subgroup of the group of invertible n Ã— n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} matrices (under matrix multiplication) that is defined by polynomial equations. An example is the orthogonal group, defined by the relation M T M = I n {\\displaystyle M^{T}M=I_{n}} where M T {\\displaystyle M^{T}} is the transpose of M {\\displaystyle M} .","image":"59d2b4cb72e304526cf5b5887147729ea259da78.svg","url":"Linear_algebraic_group"}
