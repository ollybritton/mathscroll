{"title":"Core-compact space","summary":"In general topology and related branches of mathematics, a core-compact topological space X {\\displaystyle X} is a topological space whose partially ordered set of open subsets is a continuous poset.[1] Equivalently, X {\\displaystyle X} is core-compact if it is exponentiable in the category Top of topological spaces.[1][2][3] Expanding the definition of an exponential object, this means that for any Y {\\displaystyle Y} , the set of continuous functions C ( X , Y ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}(X,Y)} has a topology such that function application is a unique continuous function from X Ã— C ( X , Y ) {\\displaystyle X\\times {\\mathcal {C}}(X,Y)} to Y {\\displaystyle Y} , which is given by the Compact-open topology and is the most general way to define it.[4]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Core-compact_space"}
