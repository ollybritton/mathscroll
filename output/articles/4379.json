{"title":"Dogbone space","summary":"In geometric topology, the dogbone space,  constructed by  R. H. BingÂ (1957), is a quotient space of three-dimensional Euclidean space R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} such that all inverse images of points are points or tame arcs, yet it is not homeomorphic to R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} . The name \"dogbone space\" refers to a fanciful resemblance between some of the diagrams of genus 2 surfaces in R. H. Bing's paper and a dog bone. Bing (1959) showed that the product of the dogbone space with R 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{1}} is homeomorphic to R 4 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{4}} .","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg","url":"Dogbone_space"}
