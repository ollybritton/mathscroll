{"title":"Vertical position","summary":"Vertical position or vertical location is a position along a vertical direction above or below a given vertical datum (reference level). Vertical distance or vertical separation is the distance between two vertical positions. Many vertical coordinates exist for expressing vertical position: depth, height, altitude, elevation, etc. Points lying on an equigeopotential surface are said to be on the same vertical level, as in a water level.","image":"Commons-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Vertical_position"}
