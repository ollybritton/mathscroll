{"title":"Dendroid (topology)","summary":"In mathematics, a dendroid is a type of topological space, satisfying the properties that it is hereditarily unicoherent (meaning that every subcontinuum of X is unicoherent), arcwise connected, and forms a continuum.[1] The term dendroid was introduced by Bronisław Knaster lecturing at the University of Wrocław,[2] although these spaces were studied earlier by Karol Borsuk and others.[3][4]","image":"Dendrite_julia.png.webp","url":"Dendroid_(topology)"}
