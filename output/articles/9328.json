{"title":"Lindsey–Fox algorithm","summary":"The Lindsey–Fox algorithm, named after Pat Lindsey and Jim Fox, is a numerical algorithm for finding the roots or zeros of a high-degree polynomial with real coefficients over the complex field. It is particularly designed for random coefficients but also works well on polynomials with coefficients from samples of speech, seismic signals, and other measured phenomena. A Matlab implementation of this has factored polynomials of degree over a million on a desktop computer.","image":"FFT_Cell.png.webp","url":"Lindsey–Fox_algorithm"}
