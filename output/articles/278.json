{"title":"Absolute irreducibility","summary":"In mathematics, a multivariate polynomial defined over the rational numbers is absolutely irreducible if it is  irreducible over the complex field.[1][2][3] For example, x 2 + y 2 − 1 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-1} is absolutely irreducible, but while x 2 + y 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}} is irreducible over the integers and the reals, it is reducible over the complex numbers as x 2 + y 2 = ( x + i y ) ( x − i y ) , {\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=(x+iy)(x-iy),} and thus not absolutely irreducible.","image":"940af5c5914cbad8092892009f82323eebf9cb5a.svg","url":"Absolute_irreducibility"}
