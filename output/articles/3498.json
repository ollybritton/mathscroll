{"title":"Course-of-values recursion","summary":"In computability theory, course-of-values recursion is a technique for defining number-theoretic functions by recursion. In a definition of a function f by course-of-values recursion, the value of f(n) is computed from the sequence ⟨ f ( 0 ) , f ( 1 ) , … , f ( n − 1 ) ⟩ {\\displaystyle \\langle f(0),f(1),\\ldots ,f(n-1)\\rangle } .","image":"2ed8438d7e8edf03a9c50616464917ab505eb132.svg","url":"Course-of-values_recursion"}
