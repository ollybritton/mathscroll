{"title":"Unit interval","summary":"In mathematics, the unit interval is the closed interval [0,1], that is, the set of all real numbers that are greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.  It is often denoted I (capital letter .mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace}I). In addition to its role in real analysis, the unit interval is used to study homotopy theory in the field of topology.","image":"Unit-interval.svg.png.webp","url":"Unit_interval"}
