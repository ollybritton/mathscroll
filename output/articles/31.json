{"title":"1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ⋯","summary":"In mathematics, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ⋯, also written ∑ n = 1 ∞ n 0 {\\displaystyle \\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty }n^{0}} , ∑ n = 1 ∞ 1 n {\\displaystyle \\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty }1^{n}} , or simply ∑ n = 1 ∞ 1 {\\displaystyle \\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty }1} , is a divergent series, meaning that its sequence of partial sums does not converge to a limit in the real numbers. The sequence 1n can be thought of as a geometric series with the common ratio 1. Unlike other geometric series with rational ratio (except −1), it converges in neither the real numbers nor in the p-adic numbers for some p.
