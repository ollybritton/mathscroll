{"title":"Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)","summary":"In linear algebra, the minimal polynomial μA of an n × n matrix A over a field F is the monic polynomial P over F of least degree such that P(A) = 0.  Any other polynomial Q with Q(A) = 0 is a (polynomial) multiple of μA.","image":"52e71f4a1b2044be55feb8f697bca0fc97ad2b03.svg","url":"Minimal_polynomial_(linear_algebra)"}
