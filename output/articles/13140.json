{"title":"Rational arrival process","summary":"In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, a rational arrival process (RAP) is a mathematical model for the time between job arrivals to a system. It extends the concept of a Markov arrival process, allowing for dependent matrix-exponential distributed inter-arrival times.[1]","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Rational_arrival_process"}
