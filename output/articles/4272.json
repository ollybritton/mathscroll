{"title":"Discriminant of an algebraic number field","summary":"In mathematics, the discriminant of an algebraic number field is a numerical invariant that, loosely speaking, measures the size of the (ring of integers of the) algebraic number field. More specifically, it is proportional to the squared volume of the fundamental domain of the ring of integers, and it regulates which primes are ramified.","image":"Discriminant49CubicFieldFundamentalDomain.png.webp","url":"Discriminant_of_an_algebraic_number_field"}
