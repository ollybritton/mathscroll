{"title":"Construction of the real numbers","summary":"In mathematics, there are several equivalent ways of defining the real numbers. One of them is that they form a complete ordered field that does not contain any smaller complete ordered field. Such a definition does not prove that such a complete ordered field exists, and the existence proof consists of constructing a mathematical structure that satisfies the definition.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Construction_of_the_real_numbers"}
