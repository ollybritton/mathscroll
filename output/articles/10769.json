{"title":"Multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem","summary":"In algebra and algebraic geometry, the multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem is a generalization to multi-homogeneous polynomials of Bézout's theorem, which counts the number of isolated common zeros of a set of homogeneous polynomials. This generalization is due to Igor Shafarevich.[1]","image":"53194d236d4a46fe6bed6e86282f7f111585d373.svg","url":"Multi-homogeneous_Bézout_theorem"}
