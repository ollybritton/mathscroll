{"title":"Smooth maximum","summary":"In mathematics, a smooth maximum of an indexed family x1, ..., xn of numbers is a smooth approximation to the maximum function max ( x 1 , … , x n ) , {\\displaystyle \\max(x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n}),} meaning a parametric family of functions m α ( x 1 , … , x n ) {\\displaystyle m_{\\alpha }(x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n})} such that for every α, the function m α {\\displaystyle m_{\\alpha }} is smooth, and the family converges to the maximum function m α → max {\\displaystyle m_{\\alpha }\\to \\max } as α → ∞ {\\displaystyle \\alpha \\to \\infty } . The concept of smooth minimum is similarly defined. In many cases, a single family approximates both: maximum as the parameter goes to positive infinity, minimum as the parameter goes to negative infinity; in symbols, m α → max {\\displaystyle m_{\\alpha }\\to \\max } as α → ∞ {\\displaystyle \\alpha \\to \\infty } and m α → min {\\displaystyle m_{\\alpha }\\to \\min } as α → − ∞ {\\displaystyle \\alpha \\to -\\infty } . The term can also be used loosely for a specific smooth function that behaves similarly to a maximum, without necessarily being part of a parametrized family.","image":"7bf9b4a3e868e95639079ad4c5663e89a1c3cdc4.svg","url":"Smooth_maximum"}
