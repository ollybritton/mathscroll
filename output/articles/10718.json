{"title":"Morrey–Campanato space","summary":"In mathematics, the Morrey–Campanato spaces (named after Charles B. Morrey, Jr. and Sergio Campanato) L λ , p ( Ω ) {\\displaystyle L^{\\lambda ,p}(\\Omega )} are Banach spaces which extend the notion of functions of bounded mean oscillation, describing situations where the oscillation of the function in a ball is proportional to some power of the radius other than the dimension. They are used in the theory of elliptic partial differential equations, since for certain values of λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } , elements of the space L λ , p ( Ω ) {\\displaystyle L^{\\lambda ,p}(\\Omega )} are Hölder continuous functions over the domain Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } .","image":"8b8af58fa038369c3ec6386c6656aab82825e372.svg","url":"Morrey–Campanato_space"}
