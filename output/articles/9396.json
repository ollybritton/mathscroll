{"title":"Line–plane intersection","summary":"In analytic geometry, the intersection of a line and a plane in three-dimensional space can be the empty set, a point, or a line. It is the entire line if that line is embedded in the plane, and is the empty set if the line is parallel to the plane but outside it. Otherwise, the line cuts through the plane at a single point.","image":"Plane-line_intersection.svg.png.webp","url":"Line–plane_intersection"}
