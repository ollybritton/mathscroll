{"title":"Platonic graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a Platonic graph is a graph that has one of the Platonic solids as its skeleton. There are 5 Platonic graphs, and all of them are regular, polyhedral (and therefore by necessity also 3-vertex-connected, vertex-transitive, edge-transitive and planar graphs), and also Hamiltonian graphs.[1]","image":"3-simplex_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Platonic_graph"}
