{"title":"Velocity","summary":"Velocity is the directional speed of an object in motion as an indication of its rate of change in position as observed from a particular frame of reference and as measured by a particular standard of time (e.g. 60Â km/h northbound). Velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies.","image":"US_Navy_040501-N-1336S-037_The_U.S._Navy_sponsored_Chevy_Monte_Carlo_NASCAR_leads_a_pack_into_turn_four_at_California_Speedway.jpg.webp","url":"Velocity"}
