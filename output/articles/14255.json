{"title":"Shape parameter","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, a shape parameter (also known as form parameter)[1] is a kind of numerical parameter of a parametric family of probability distributions[2] that is neither a location parameter nor a scale parameter (nor a function of these, such as a rate parameter). Such a parameter must affect the shape of a distribution rather than simply shifting it (as a location parameter does) or stretching/shrinking it (as a scale parameter does). For example, \"peakedness\" refers to how round the main peak is.[3]","image":"Standard_symmetric_pdfs.svg.png.webp","url":"Shape_parameter"}
