{"title":"Wild knot","summary":"In the mathematical theory of knots, a knot is tame if it can be \"thickened\", that is, if there exists an extension to an embedding of the solid torus S 1 Ã— D 2 {\\displaystyle S^{1}\\times D^{2}} into the 3-sphere. A knot is tame if and only if it can be represented as a finite closed polygonal chain. Every closed curve containing a wild arc is a wild knot.[1] Knots that are not tame are called wild and can have pathological behavior. In knot theory and 3-manifold theory, often the adjective \"tame\" is omitted. Smooth knots, for example, are always tame.","image":"74d3f49e367f957041e7e58a13728b1cf2db1f20.svg","url":"Wild_knot"}
