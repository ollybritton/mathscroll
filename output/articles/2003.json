{"title":"Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation","summary":"In mathematical logic, the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation, or BHK interpretation, of intuitionistic logic was proposed by L. E. J. Brouwer and Arend Heyting, and independently by Andrey Kolmogorov. It is also sometimes called the realizability interpretation, because of the connection with the realizability theory of Stephen Kleene. It is the standard explanation of intuitionistic logic.[1]","image":"f06f4755cd6448f81c2bfdd46aea759952cdc89a.svg","url":"Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov_interpretation"}
