{"title":"Mingarelli identity","summary":"In the field of ordinary differential equations, the Mingarelli identity[1] is a theorem that provides criteria for the oscillation and non-oscillation of solutions of some linear differential equations in the real domain. It extends the Picone identity from two to three or more differential equations of the second order.","image":"07c106f037db2720362e105bdda9a9f0d21d62f8.svg","url":"Mingarelli_identity"}
