{"title":"Probability integral transform","summary":"In probability theory, the probability integral transform (also known as universality of the uniform) relates to the result that data values that are modeled as being random variables from any given continuous distribution can be converted to random variables having a standard uniform distribution.[1] This holds exactly provided that the distribution being used is the true distribution of the random variables; if the distribution is one fitted to the data, the result will hold approximately in large samples.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Probability_integral_transform"}
