{"title":"Trivially perfect graph","summary":"In graph theory, a trivially perfect graph is a graph with the property that in each of its induced subgraphs the size of the maximum independent set equals the number of maximal cliques.[1] Trivially perfect graphs were first studied by (WolkÂ 1962, 1965) but were named by Golumbic (1978); Golumbic writes that \"the name was chosen since it is trivial to show that such a graph is perfect.\" Trivially perfect graphs are also known as comparability graphs of trees,[2] arborescent comparability graphs,[3] and quasi-threshold graphs.[4]","image":"Trivially_perfect_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Trivially_perfect_graph"}
