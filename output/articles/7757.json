{"title":"Infimum and supremum","summary":"In mathematics, the infimum (abbreviated inf; plural infima) of a subset S {\\displaystyle S} of a partially ordered set P {\\displaystyle P} is a greatest element in P {\\displaystyle P} that is less than or equal to each element of S , {\\displaystyle S,} if such an element exists.[1]  Consequently, the term greatest lower bound (abbreviated as GLB) is also commonly used.[1] The supremum (abbreviated sup; plural suprema) of a subset S {\\displaystyle S} of a partially ordered set P {\\displaystyle P} is the least element in P {\\displaystyle P} that is greater than or equal to each element of S , {\\displaystyle S,} if such an element exists.[1] Consequently, the supremum is also referred to as the least upper bound (or LUB).[1]","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Infimum_and_supremum"}
