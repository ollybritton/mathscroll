{"title":"Grunsky's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Grunsky's theorem, due to the German mathematician Helmut Grunsky, is a result in complex analysis concerning holomorphic univalent functions defined on the unit disk in the complex numbers. The theorem  states that a univalent function defined on the unit disc, fixing the point 0, maps every disk |z| < r onto a starlike domain for r ≤ tanh π/4. The largest r for which this is true is called the radius of starlikeness of the function.","image":"da3976964e6fcfd2cb859dcbb00107a1f37ccf51.svg","url":"Grunsky's_theorem"}
