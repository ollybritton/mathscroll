{"title":"Power residue symbol","summary":"In algebraic number theory the n-th power residue symbol (for an integer n > 2) is a generalization of the (quadratic) Legendre symbol to n-th powers. These symbols are used in the statement and proof of cubic, quartic, Eisenstein, and related higher[1] reciprocity laws.[2]","image":"78758c163c0f13c6c4ebabc6e1e35d64f1688395.svg","url":"Power_residue_symbol"}
