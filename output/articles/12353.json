{"title":"Polynomial remainder theorem","summary":"In algebra, the polynomial remainder theorem or little Bézout's theorem (named after Étienne Bézout)[1] is an application of Euclidean division of polynomials. It states that, for every number r , {\\displaystyle r,} any polynomial f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} is the sum of f ( r ) {\\displaystyle f(r)} and the product by x − r {\\displaystyle x-r} of a polynomial in x {\\displaystyle x} of degree less than the degree of f . {\\displaystyle f.} In particular, f ( r ) {\\displaystyle f(r)} is the remainder of the Euclidean division of f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} by x − r , {\\displaystyle x-r,} and x − r {\\displaystyle x-r} is a divisor of f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} if and only if f ( r ) = 0 , {\\displaystyle f(r)=0,} [2] a property known as the factor theorem.","image":"250644a0f511e9078be6f89ba78a606a0e08c0a0.svg","url":"Polynomial_remainder_theorem"}
