{"title":"Landweber exact functor theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Landweber exact functor theorem, named after Peter Landweber, is a theorem in algebraic topology. It is known that a complex orientation of a homology theory leads to a formal group law. The Landweber exact functor theorem (or LEFT for short) can be seen as a method to reverse this process: it constructs a homology theory out of a formal group law.","image":"d5228db62606331fa63bcc6151d8f57be933b450.svg","url":"Landweber_exact_functor_theorem"}
