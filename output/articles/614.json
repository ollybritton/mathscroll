{"title":"Algebraic surface","summary":"In mathematics, an algebraic surface is an algebraic variety of dimension two. In the case of geometry over the field of complex numbers, an algebraic surface has complex dimension two (as a complex manifold, when it is non-singular) and so of dimension four as a smooth manifold.","image":"0c0b14a6cab7974f68d39ef402066d46ac314f87.svg","url":"Algebraic_surface"}
