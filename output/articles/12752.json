{"title":"Puppe sequence","summary":"In mathematics, the Puppe sequence is a construction of homotopy theory, so named after Dieter Puppe. It comes in two forms: a long exact sequence, built from the mapping fibre (a fibration), and a long coexact sequence, built from the mapping cone (which is a cofibration).[1] Intuitively, the Puppe sequence allows us to think of homology theory as a functor that takes spaces to long-exact sequences of groups. It is also useful as a tool to build long exact sequences of relative homotopy groups.","image":"1121a60f2db1990d0542ab2f0d24d7e6f67ef638.svg","url":"Puppe_sequence"}
