{"title":"Erdős–Stone theorem","summary":"In extremal graph theory, the Erdős–Stone theorem is an asymptotic result generalising Turán's theorem to bound the number of edges in an H-free graph for a non-complete graph H. It is named after Paul Erdős and Arthur Stone, who proved it in 1946,[1]   and it has been described as the “fundamental theorem of extremal graph theory”.[2]","image":"a8ae86a1b8d036247947726ce44f3d5fbbdb5c56.svg","url":"Erdős–Stone_theorem"}
