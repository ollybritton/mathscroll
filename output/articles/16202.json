{"title":"Trémaux tree","summary":"In graph theory, a Trémaux tree of an undirected graph G {\\displaystyle G} is a type of spanning tree, generalizing depth-first search trees. They are defined by the property that every edge of G {\\displaystyle G} connects an ancestor–descendant pair in the tree. Trémaux trees are named after Charles Pierre Trémaux, a 19th-century French author who used a form of depth-first search as a strategy for solving mazes.[1][2] They have also been called normal spanning trees, especially in the context of infinite graphs.[3][4]","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Trémaux_tree"}
