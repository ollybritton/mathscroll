{"title":"Multiscale modeling","summary":"Multiscale modeling  or multiscale mathematics is the field of solving problems that have important features at multiple scales of time and/or space. Important problems include multiscale modeling of fluids,[1][2] solids,[2][3] polymers,[4][5] proteins,[6][7][8][9] nucleic acids[10] as well as various physical and chemical phenomena (like adsorption, chemical reactions, diffusion).[8][11][12]","image":"Holec2016P40.svg.png.webp","url":"Multiscale_modeling"}
