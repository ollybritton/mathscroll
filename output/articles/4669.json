{"title":"Eigenfunction","summary":"In mathematics, an eigenfunction of a linear operator D defined on some function space is any non-zero function f {\\displaystyle f} in that space that, when acted upon by D, is only multiplied by some scaling factor called an eigenvalue. As an equation, this condition can be written as","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Eigenfunction"}
