{"title":"Integer-valued polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, an integer-valued polynomial (also known as a numerical polynomial) P ( t ) {\\displaystyle P(t)} is a polynomial whose value P ( n ) {\\displaystyle P(n)} is an integer for every integer n. Every polynomial with integer coefficients is integer-valued, but the converse is not true. For example, the polynomial","image":"941c1fb8073a146dc9938ef2aa43c2a84f6b2c97.svg","url":"Integer-valued_polynomial"}
