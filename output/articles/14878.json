{"title":"Squaring the circle","summary":"Squaring the circle is a problem in geometry first proposed in Greek mathematics. It is the challenge of constructing a square with the area of a circle by using only a finite number of steps with a compass and straightedge. The difficulty of the problem raised the question of whether specified axioms of Euclidean geometry concerning the existence of lines and circles implied the existence of such a square.","image":"Squaring_the_circle.svg.png.webp","url":"Squaring_the_circle"}
