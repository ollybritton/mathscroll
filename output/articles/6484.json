{"title":"Graph realization problem","summary":"The graph realization problem is a decision problem in graph theory. Given a finite sequence ( d 1 , … , d n ) {\\displaystyle (d_{1},\\dots ,d_{n})} of natural numbers, the problem asks whether there is a labeled simple graph such that ( d 1 , … , d n ) {\\displaystyle (d_{1},\\dots ,d_{n})} is the degree sequence of this graph.","image":"6a6e367e0957d8c3d2f8e6ef16bc3bb395349b57.svg","url":"Graph_realization_problem"}
