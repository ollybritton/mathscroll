{"title":"Double pushout graph rewriting","summary":"In computer science, double pushout graph rewriting (or DPO graph rewriting) refers to a mathematical framework for graph rewriting. It was introduced as one of the first algebraic approaches to graph rewriting in the article \"Graph-grammars: An algebraic approach\" (1973).[1] It has since been generalized to allow rewriting structures which are not graphs, and to handle negative application conditions,[2] among other extensions.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Double_pushout_graph_rewriting"}
