{"title":"Factorization algebra","summary":"In mathematics and mathematical physics, a factorization algebra is an algebraic structure first introduced by Beilinson and Drinfel'd in an algebro-geometric setting as a reformulation of chiral algebras,[1] and also studied in a more general setting by Costello to study quantum field theory.[2]","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Factorization_algebra"}
