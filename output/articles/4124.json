{"title":"Dihedron","summary":"A dihedron is a type of polyhedron, made of two polygon faces which share the same set of n edges. In three-dimensional Euclidean space, it is degenerate if its faces are flat, while in three-dimensional spherical space, a dihedron with flat faces can be thought of as a lens, an example of which is the fundamental domain of a lens space L(p,q).[1] Dihedra have also been called bihedra,[2] flat polyhedra,[3] or doubly covered polygons.[3]","image":"Hexagonal_dihedron.svg.png.webp","url":"Dihedron"}
