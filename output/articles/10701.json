{"title":"Mordell–Weil theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Mordell–Weil theorem states that for an abelian variety A {\\displaystyle A} over a number field K {\\displaystyle K} , the group A ( K ) {\\displaystyle A(K)} of K-rational points of A {\\displaystyle A} is a finitely-generated abelian group, called the Mordell–Weil group. The case with A {\\displaystyle A} an elliptic curve E {\\displaystyle E} and K {\\displaystyle K} the field of rational numbers is Mordell's theorem, answering a question apparently posed by Henri Poincaré around 1901; it was proved by Louis Mordell in 1922. It is a foundational theorem of Diophantine geometry and the arithmetic of abelian varieties.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Mordell–Weil_theorem"}
