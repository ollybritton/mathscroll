{"title":"Peter–Weyl theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Peter–Weyl theorem is a basic result in the theory of harmonic analysis, applying to topological groups that are compact, but are not necessarily abelian. It was initially proved by Hermann Weyl, with his student Fritz Peter, in the setting of a compact topological group G (Peter & Weyl 1927). The theorem is a collection of results generalizing the significant facts about the decomposition of the regular representation of any finite group, as discovered by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and Issai Schur.","image":"33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e.svg","url":"Peter–Weyl_theorem"}
