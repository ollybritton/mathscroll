{"title":"One-way function","summary":"In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input.  Here, \"easy\" and \"hard\" are to be understood in the sense of computational complexity theory, specifically the theory of polynomial time problems. Not being one-to-one is not considered sufficient for a function to be called one-way (see Theoretical definition, below).","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"One-way_function"}
