{"title":"Quasi-complete space","summary":"In functional analysis, a topological vector space (TVS) is said to be quasi-complete or boundedly complete[1] if every closed and bounded subset is complete.[2] This concept is of considerable importance for non-metrizable TVSs.[2]","image":"983864c919beaa2c60617d356d231834e2b9ea3d.svg","url":"Quasi-complete_space"}
