{"title":"Stericated 24-cell honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the stericated 24-cell honeycomb (or stericated 16-cell honeycomb) is a uniform space-filling honeycomb. It can be seen as a sterication of the regular 24-cell honeycomb, containing 24-cell, 16-cell, octahedral prism, tetrahedral prism, and 3-3 duoprism cells.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Stericated_24-cell_honeycomb"}
