{"title":"Dixon elliptic functions","summary":"In mathematics, the Dixon elliptic functions sm and cm are two elliptic functions (doubly periodic meromorphic functions on the complex plane) that map from each regular hexagon in a hexagonal tiling to the whole complex plane. Because these functions satisfy the identity cm 3 ⁡ z + sm 3 ⁡ z = 1 {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {cm} ^{3}z+\\operatorname {sm} ^{3}z=1} , as real functions they parametrize the cubic Fermat curve x 3 + y 3 = 1 {\\displaystyle x^{3}+y^{3}=1} , just as the trigonometric functions sine and cosine parametrize the unit circle x 2 + y 2 = 1 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=1} .","image":"1f97ed2681a6ed5349540c4e78ecb4b9d12d8ba3.svg","url":"Dixon_elliptic_functions"}
