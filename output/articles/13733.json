{"title":"Rothberger space","summary":"In mathematics, a Rothberger space is a topological space that satisfies a certain a basic selection principle. A Rothberger space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers U 1 , U 2 , … {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {U}}_{1},{\\mathcal {U}}_{2},\\ldots } of the space there are sets U 1 ∈ U 1 , U 2 ∈ U 2 , … {\\displaystyle U_{1}\\in {\\mathcal {U}}_{1},U_{2}\\in {\\mathcal {U}}_{2},\\ldots } such that the family { U n : n ∈ N } {\\displaystyle \\{U_{n}:n\\in \\mathbb {N} \\}} covers the space.","image":"65ddf597330a38fd737d609d0549d4e8de1ade13.svg","url":"Rothberger_space"}
