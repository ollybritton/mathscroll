{"title":"Central angle","summary":"A central angle is an angle whose apex (vertex) is the center O of a circle and whose legs (sides) are radii intersecting the circle in two distinct points A and B. Central angles are subtended by an arc between those two points, and the arc length is the central angle of a circle of radius one (measured in radians).[1] The central angle is also known as the arc's angular distance. The arc length spanned by a central angle on a sphere is called spherical distance.","image":"Sector_central_angle_arc.svg.png.webp","url":"Central_angle"}
