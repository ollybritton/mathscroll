{"title":"Elongated pentagonal orthobicupola","summary":"In geometry, the elongated pentagonal orthobicupola or cantellated pentagonal prism is one of the Johnson solids (J38).[1] As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal orthobicupola (J30) by inserting a decagonal prism between its two congruent halves. Rotating one of the cupolae through 36 degrees before inserting the prism yields an elongated pentagonal gyrobicupola (J39).","image":"Elongated_pentagonal_orthobicupola.png.webp","url":"Elongated_pentagonal_orthobicupola"}
