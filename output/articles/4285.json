{"title":"Disk covering problem","summary":"The disk covering problem asks for the smallest real number r ( n ) {\\displaystyle r(n)} such that n {\\displaystyle n} disks of radius r ( n ) {\\displaystyle r(n)} can be arranged in such a way as to cover the unit disk. Dually, for a given radius ε, one wishes to find the smallest integer n such that n disks of radius ε can cover the unit disk.[1]","image":"722d91386412ec08e01af45feee1d2f2b0f94e9d.svg","url":"Disk_covering_problem"}
