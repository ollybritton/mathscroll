{"title":"Cobordism hypothesis","summary":"In mathematics, the cobordism hypothesis, due to John C. Baez and James Dolan,[1] concerns the classification of extended topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). In 2008, Jacob Lurie outlined a proof of the cobordism hypothesis, though the details of his approach have yet to appear in the literature as of 2022.[2][3][4] In 2021, Daniel Grady and Dmitri Pavlov claimed a complete proof of the cobordism hypothesis, as well as a generalization to bordisms with arbitrary geometric structures.[4]","image":"10b4fc0d99d8c5f93b297b7c62990a97df6dd119.svg","url":"Cobordism_hypothesis"}
