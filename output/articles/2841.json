{"title":"Coherence condition","summary":"In mathematics, and particularly category theory, a coherence condition is a collection of conditions requiring that various compositions of elementary morphisms are equal. Typically the elementary morphisms are part of the data of the category. A coherence theorem states that, in order to be assured that all these equalities hold, it suffices to check a small number of identities.","image":"35d4becbb90870c3c7ce7564ae1a52d4f9d420fc.svg","url":"Coherence_condition"}
