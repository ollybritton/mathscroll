{"title":"Hurewicz theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Hurewicz theorem is a basic result of algebraic topology, connecting homotopy theory with homology theory via a map known as the Hurewicz homomorphism. The theorem is named after Witold Hurewicz, and generalizes earlier results of Henri Poincar√©.","image":"421f612c974971420245e0aeec1bb80a1de443ce.svg","url":"Hurewicz_theorem"}
