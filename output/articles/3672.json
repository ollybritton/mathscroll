{"title":"Cutting-plane method","summary":"In mathematical optimization, the cutting-plane method is any of a variety of optimization methods that iteratively refine a feasible set or objective function by means of linear inequalities, termed cuts.  Such procedures are commonly used to find integer solutions to mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, as well as to solve general, not necessarily differentiable convex optimization problems.  The use of cutting planes to solve MILP was introduced by Ralph E. Gomory.","image":"TSP_cutting_plane.png.webp","url":"Cutting-plane_method"}
