{"title":"Serial concatenated convolutional codes","summary":"Serial concatenated convolutional codes (SCCC) are a class of forward error correction (FEC) codes highly suitable for turbo (iterative) decoding.[1][2]  Data to be transmitted over a noisy channel may first be encoded using an SCCC.  Upon reception, the coding may be used to remove any errors introduced during transmission. The decoding is performed by repeated decoding and [de]interleaving of the received symbols.","image":"SCCC_Encoder.png.webp","url":"Serial_concatenated_convolutional_codes"}
