{"title":"Weyl integration formula","summary":"In mathematics, the Weyl integration formula, introduced by Hermann Weyl, is an integration formula for a compact connected Lie group G in terms of a maximal torus T. Precisely, it says[1] there exists a real-valued continuous function u on T such that for every class function f on G:","image":"a2269b0533e51448e5c3f50165d211626f3b390c.svg","url":"Weyl_integration_formula"}
