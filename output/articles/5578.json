{"title":"Form factor (electronics)","summary":"In electronics or electrical engineering the form factor of an alternating current waveform (signal) is the ratio of the RMS (root mean square) value to the average value (mathematical mean of absolute values of all points on the waveform).[1] It identifies the ratio of the direct current of equal power relative to the given alternating current. The former can also be defined as the direct current that will produce equivalent heat.[2]","image":"efb37b8329075bb98d279a5cae61513ea5120182.svg","url":"Form_factor_(electronics)"}
