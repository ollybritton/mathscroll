{"title":"Coastline paradox","summary":"The coastline paradox is the counterintuitive observation that the coastline of a landmass does not have a well-defined length.  This results from the fractal curve-like properties of coastlines; i.e., the fact that a coastline typically has a fractal dimension.   Although the \"paradox of length\" was previously noted by Hugo Steinhaus,[1] the first systematic study of this phenomenon was by Lewis Fry Richardson,[2][3] and it was expanded upon by Benoit Mandelbrot.[4][5]","image":"Britain-fractal-coastline-100km.png.webp","url":"Coastline_paradox"}
