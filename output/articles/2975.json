{"title":"Complete graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a complete graph is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.  A complete digraph is a directed graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a pair of unique edges (one in each direction).[1]","image":"Complete_graph_K7.svg.png.webp","url":"Complete_graph"}
