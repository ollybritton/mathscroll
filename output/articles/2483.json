{"title":"Chapman–Kolmogorov equation","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in the theory of Markovian stochastic processes in probability theory, the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation(CKE) is an identity relating the joint probability distributions of different sets of coordinates on a stochastic process.   The equation was derived independently by both the British mathematician Sydney Chapman and the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov. CKE prominently used in recent Variational Bayesian methods.","image":"5f033579af0d3415ce74a89090983e5f341b46b4.svg","url":"Chapman–Kolmogorov_equation"}
