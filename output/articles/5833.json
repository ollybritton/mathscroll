{"title":"Functional determinant","summary":"In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, it is sometimes possible to generalize the notion of the determinant of a square matrix of finite order (representing a linear transformation from a finite-dimensional vector space to itself) to the infinite-dimensional case of a linear operator S mapping a function space V to itself. The corresponding quantity det(S) is called the functional determinant of S.","image":"5858443c8b1e4545a2f304403c2ce9bc89c15e0d.svg","url":"Functional_determinant"}
