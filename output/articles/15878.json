{"title":"Toric code","summary":"The toric code is a topological quantum error correcting code, and an example of a stabilizer code, defined on a two-dimensional spin lattice.[1] It is the simplest and most well studied of the quantum double models.[2] It is also the simplest example of topological orderâ€”Z2 topological order (first studied in the context of Z2 spin liquid in 1991).[3][4]  The toric code can also be considered to be a Z2 lattice gauge theory in a particular limit.[5] It was introduced by Alexei Kitaev.","image":"e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597.svg","url":"Toric_code"}
