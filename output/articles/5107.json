{"title":"Evdokimov's algorithm","summary":"In computational number theory,  Evdokimov's algorithm, named after Sergei Evdokimov, is the asymptotically fastest known algorithm for factorization of polynomials (until 2019). It can factorize a one-variable polynomial of degree n {\\displaystyle n} over an explicitly given finite field of cardinality q {\\displaystyle q} . Assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis the algorithm runs in deterministic time ( n log ⁡ n log ⁡ q ) O ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle (n^{\\log n}\\log q)^{{\\mathcal {O}}(1)}} [1] (see Big O notation). This is an improvement of both Berlekamp's algorithm and Rónyai's algorithm[2] in the sense that the first algorithm is polynomial for small characteristic of the field, whearas the second one is polynomial for small n {\\displaystyle n} ; however, both of them are exponential if no restriction is made.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Evdokimov's_algorithm"}
