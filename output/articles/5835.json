{"title":"Functional equation","summary":"In mathematics, a functional equation [1][2] is, in the broadest meaning, an equation in which one or several functions appear as unknowns. So, differential equations and integral equations are functional equations. However, a more restricted meaning is often used, where a functional equation is an equation that relates several values of the same function. For example, the logarithm functions are essentially characterized by the logarithmic functional equation log ⁡ ( x y ) = log ⁡ ( x ) + log ⁡ ( y ) . {\\displaystyle \\log(xy)=\\log(x)+\\log(y).}","image":"407fb881b785c9c35094edaf8868a31a1d25dd7d.svg","url":"Functional_equation"}
