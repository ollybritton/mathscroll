{"title":"Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)","summary":"In mathematics, Liouville's theorem, proved by Joseph Liouville in 1850,[1] is a rigidity theorem about conformal mappings in Euclidean space. It states that any smooth conformal mapping on a domain of Rn, where n > 2, can be expressed as a composition of translations, similarities, orthogonal transformations and inversions: they are Möbius transformations (in n dimensions).[2][3] This theorem severely limits the variety of possible conformal mappings in R3 and higher-dimensional spaces. By contrast, conformal mappings in R2 can be much more complicated – for example, all simply connected planar domains are conformally equivalent, by the Riemann mapping theorem.","image":"9c25bd89205d1066b804caa678e7db182cc393d2.svg","url":"Liouville's_theorem_(conformal_mappings)"}
