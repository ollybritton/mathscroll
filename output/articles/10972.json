{"title":"Nearly completely decomposable Markov chain","summary":"In probability theory, a nearly completely decomposable (NCD) Markov chain is a Markov chain where the state space can be partitioned in such a way that movement within a partition occurs much more frequently than movement between partitions.[1] Particularly efficient algorithms exist to compute the stationary distribution of Markov chains with this property.[2]","image":"c331117df47808070414c92110aa408edd8e1562.svg","url":"Nearly_completely_decomposable_Markov_chain"}
