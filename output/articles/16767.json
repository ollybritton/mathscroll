{"title":"Weak duality","summary":"In applied mathematics, weak duality is a concept in optimization which states that the duality gap is always greater than or equal to 0.  That means the solution to the dual (minimization) problem is always greater than or equal to the solution to an associated primal problem.  This is opposed to strong duality which only holds in certain cases.[1]","image":"236a50b71b4d706f3ed489b2746ca3a591ba3808.svg","url":"Weak_duality"}
