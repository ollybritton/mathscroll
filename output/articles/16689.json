{"title":"Von Neumann regular ring","summary":"In mathematics, a von Neumann regular ring is a ring R (associative, with 1, not necessarily commutative) such that for every element a in R there exists an x in R with a = axa. One may think of x as a \"weak inverse\" of the element a; in general x is not uniquely determined by a.  Von Neumann regular rings are also called absolutely flat rings, because these rings are characterized by the fact that every left R-module is flat.","image":"dda3ad73ec95ddf1819423984fa7a07d6f206b25.svg","url":"Von_Neumann_regular_ring"}
