{"title":"Henselian ring","summary":"In mathematics, a Henselian ring (or Hensel ring) is a  local ring in which Hensel's lemma holds. They were introduced by Azumaya (1951), who named them after Kurt Hensel. Azumaya originally allowed Henselian rings to be non-commutative, but most authors now restrict them to be commutative.","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Henselian_ring"}
