Like most positional games, it is described by a set of positions/points/elements ( X {\\displaystyle X} ) and a family of subsets ( F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} ), which are called here the losing-sets. It is played by two players, called Avoider and Enforcer, who take turns picking elements until all elements are taken. Avoider wins if he manages to avoid taking a losing set; Enforcer wins if he manages to make Avoider take a losing set.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Avoider-Enforcer_game"}
