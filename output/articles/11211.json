{"title":"Normal basis","summary":"In mathematics, specifically the algebraic theory of fields, a normal basis is a special kind of basis for Galois extensions of finite degree, characterised as forming a single orbit for the Galois group.  The normal basis theorem states that any finite Galois extension of fields has a normal basis. In algebraic number theory, the study of the more refined question of the existence of a normal integral basis is part of Galois module theory.","image":"169f54d441f09943ce5302082f1f76d7f9676f8e.svg","url":"Normal_basis"}
