{"title":"General number field sieve","summary":"In number theory, the general number field sieve (GNFS) is the most efficient classical algorithm known for factoring integers larger than 10100. Heuristically, its complexity for factoring an integer n (consisting of ⌊log2 n⌋ + 1 bits) is of the form","image":"fcc5450b9f039008c0a728e15b6c66f24dafbb30.svg","url":"General_number_field_sieve"}
