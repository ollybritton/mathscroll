{"title":"Cartan subgroup","summary":"In the theory of algebraic groups, a Cartan subgroup of a connected linear algebraic group G {\\displaystyle G} over a (not necessarily algebraically closed) field k {\\displaystyle k} is the centralizer of a maximal torus. Cartan subgroups are smooth (equivalently reduced), connected and nilpotent. If k {\\displaystyle k} is algebraically closed, they are all conjugate to each other.
