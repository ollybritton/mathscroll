{"title":"Resource-bounded measure","summary":"Lutz's resource-bounded measure is a generalisation of Lebesgue measure to complexity classes. It was originally developed by Jack Lutz. Just as Lebesgue measure gives a method to quantify the size of subsets of the Euclidean space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} , resource bounded measure gives a method to classify the size of subsets of complexity classes.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Resource-bounded_measure"}
