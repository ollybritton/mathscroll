{"title":"Total algebra","summary":"In abstract algebra, the total algebra of a monoid is a generalization of the monoid ring that allows for infinite sums of elements of a ring.  Suppose that S is a monoid with the property that, for all s ∈ S {\\displaystyle s\\in S} , there exist only finitely many ordered pairs ( t , u ) ∈ S × S {\\displaystyle (t,u)\\in S\\times S} for which t u = s {\\displaystyle tu=s} . Let R be a ring.  Then the total algebra of S over R is the set R S {\\displaystyle R^{S}} of all functions α : S → R {\\displaystyle \\alpha :S\\to R} with the addition law given by the (pointwise) operation:","image":"acce52dffd84d073a24f4606a175da60148fd0c6.svg","url":"Total_algebra"}
