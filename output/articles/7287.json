{"title":"History monoid","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, a history monoid is a way of representing the histories of concurrently running computer processes as a collection of strings, each string representing the individual history of a process. The history monoid provides a set of synchronization primitives (such as locks, mutexes or thread joins) for providing rendezvous points between a set of independently executing processes or threads.","image":"8d31300113715d6a6aaac890136bb97af83d1163.svg","url":"History_monoid"}
