{"title":"Proof by infinite descent","summary":"In mathematics, a proof by infinite descent, also known as Fermat's method of descent, is a particular kind of proof by contradiction[1] used to show that a statement cannot possibly hold for any number, by showing that if the statement were to hold for a number, then the same would be true for a smaller number, leading to an infinite descent and ultimately a contradiction.[2] It is a method which relies on the well-ordering principle, and is often used to show that a given equation, such as a Diophantine equation, has no solutions.[3][4]","image":"a1e7be04f0750138ae80b3822554a69f9f32c925.svg","url":"Proof_by_infinite_descent"}
