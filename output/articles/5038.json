{"title":"Euclidean random matrix","summary":"Within mathematics, an N×N Euclidean random matrix Â is defined with the help of an arbitrary deterministic function f(r, r′) and of N points {ri} randomly distributed in a region V of d-dimensional Euclidean space. The element Aij of the matrix is equal to f(ri, rj): Aij = f(ri, rj).","image":"Fig_sinc.png.webp","url":"Euclidean_random_matrix"}
