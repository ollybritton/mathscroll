{"title":"Algebra of sets","summary":"In mathematics, the algebra of sets, not to be confused with the mathematical structure of an algebra of sets, defines the properties and laws of sets, the set-theoretic operations of union, intersection, and complementation and the relations of set equality and set inclusion. It also provides systematic procedures for evaluating expressions, and performing calculations, involving these operations and relations.","image":"00595c5e33692e724937fdcc8870496acce1ac74.svg","url":"Algebra_of_sets"}
