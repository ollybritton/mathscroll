{"title":"Hausdorff completion","summary":"In algebra, the Hausdorff completion G ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {G}}} of a group G with filtration G n {\\displaystyle G_{n}} is the inverse limit lim ← ⁡ G / G n {\\displaystyle \\varprojlim G/G_{n}} of the discrete group G / G n {\\displaystyle G/G_{n}} .  A basic example is a profinite completion.  The image of the canonical map G → G ^ {\\displaystyle G\\to {\\widehat {G}}} is a Hausdorff topological group and its kernel is the intersection of all G n {\\displaystyle G_{n}} : i.e., the closure of the identity element.  The canonical homomorphism gr ⁡ ( G ) → gr ⁡ ( G ^ ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {gr} (G)\\to \\operatorname {gr} ({\\widehat {G}})} is an isomorphism, where gr ⁡ ( G ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {gr} (G)} is a graded module associated to the filtration.","image":"3257528da95b4ab702b74241ff5356d688de2ce0.svg","url":"Hausdorff_completion"}
