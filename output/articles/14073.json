{"title":"Seifert–Van Kampen theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Seifert–Van Kampen theorem of algebraic topology (named after Herbert Seifert and Egbert van Kampen), sometimes just called Van Kampen's theorem,  expresses the structure of the fundamental group of a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} in terms of the fundamental groups of two open, path-connected subspaces that cover X {\\displaystyle X} . It can therefore be used for computations of the fundamental group of spaces that are constructed out of simpler ones.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Seifert–Van_Kampen_theorem"}
