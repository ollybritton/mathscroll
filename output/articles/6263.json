{"title":"Gilbreath's conjecture","summary":"Gilbreath's conjecture is a conjecture in number theory regarding the sequences generated by applying the forward difference operator to consecutive prime numbers and leaving the results unsigned, and then repeating this process on consecutive terms in the resulting sequence, and so forth. The statement is named after Norman L. Gilbreath who, in 1958, presented it to the mathematical community after observing the pattern by chance while doing arithmetic on a napkin.[1] In 1878, eighty years before Gilbreath's discovery, Fran√ßois Proth had, however, published the same observations along with an attempted proof, which was later shown to be false.[1]","image":"04151c0181ce7bdfc669722927dec975b330f0d1.svg","url":"Gilbreath's_conjecture"}
