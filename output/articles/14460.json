{"title":"Sinistral and dextral","summary":"Sinistral and dextral, in some scientific fields, are the two types of chirality (\"handedness\") or relative direction. The terms are derived from the Latin words for \"left\" (sinister) and \"right\" (dexter). Other disciplines use different terms (such as dextro- and laevo-rotary in chemistry, or clockwise and anticlockwise in physics) or simply use left and right (as in anatomy).","image":"Neptunea_-_links%26rechts_gewonden.jpg.webp","url":"Sinistral_and_dextral"}
