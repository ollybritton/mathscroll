{"title":"Hypersurface","summary":"In geometry, a hypersurface is a generalization of the concepts of hyperplane, plane curve, and surface. A hypersurface is a manifold or an algebraic variety of dimension n âˆ’ 1, which is embedded in an ambient space of dimension n, generally a Euclidean space, an affine space or a projective space.[1] Hypersurfaces share, with surfaces in a three-dimensional space, the property of being defined by a single implicit equation, at least locally (near every point), and sometimes globally.","image":"66fd49be6c916225671aa07fdad66702246e2968.svg","url":"Hypersurface"}
