{"title":"Symplectic vector field","summary":"In physics and mathematics, a symplectic vector field is one whose flow preserves a symplectic form.  That is, if ( M , ω ) {\\displaystyle (M,\\omega )} is a symplectic manifold with smooth manifold M {\\displaystyle M} and symplectic form ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } , then a vector field X ∈ X ( M ) {\\displaystyle X\\in {\\mathfrak {X}}(M)} in the Lie algebra X ( M ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {X}}(M)} is symplectic if its flow preserves the symplectic structure. In other words, the Lie derivative of the vector field must vanish:","image":"d343da33a65bc6b0682b8da9ba31e5af966ce9eb.svg","url":"Symplectic_vector_field"}
