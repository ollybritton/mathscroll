{"title":"Umbrella sampling","summary":"Umbrella sampling is a technique in computational physics and chemistry, used to improve sampling of a system (or different systems) where ergodicity is hindered by the form of the system's energy landscape. It was first suggested by Torrie and Valleau in 1977.[1] It is a particular physical application of the more general importance sampling in statistics.","image":"Ergodicity.gif","url":"Umbrella_sampling"}
