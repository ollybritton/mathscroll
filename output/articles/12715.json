{"title":"Pseudoconvex function","summary":"In convex analysis and the calculus of variations, both branches of mathematics, a pseudoconvex function is a function that behaves like a convex function with respect to finding its local minima, but need not actually be convex.  Informally, a differentiable function is pseudoconvex if it is increasing in any direction where it has a positive directional derivative. The property must hold in all of the function domain, and not only for nearby points.","image":"71c9d5ecdbb61fab9dc7c7b76a2e0feb4132ec18.svg","url":"Pseudoconvex_function"}
