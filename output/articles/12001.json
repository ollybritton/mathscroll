{"title":"Perfect complex","summary":"In algebra, a perfect complex of modules over a commutative ring A is an object in the derived category of A-modules that is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex of finite projective A-modules. A perfect module is a module that is perfect when it is viewed as a complex concentrated at degree zero. For example, if A is Noetherian, a module over A is perfect if and only if it is finitely generated and of finite projective dimension.","image":"47f833d059e4565ca5c84985c780b21f1f89f0b9.svg","url":"Perfect_complex"}
