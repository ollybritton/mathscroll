{"title":"Klee–Minty cube","summary":"The Klee–Minty cube or Klee–Minty polytope (named after Victor Klee and George J. Minty) is a unit hypercube of variable dimension whose corners have been perturbed. Klee and Minty demonstrated that George Dantzig's simplex algorithm has poor worst-case performance when initialized at one corner of their \"squashed cube\". On the three-dimensional version, the simplex algorithm and the criss-cross algorithm visit all 8 corners in the worst case.","image":"Klee-Minty-cube-for-shadow-vertex-pivot-rule.png.webp","url":"Klee–Minty_cube"}
