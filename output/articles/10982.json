{"title":"Nef line bundle","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a line bundle on a projective variety is nef if it has nonnegative degree on every curve in the variety. The classes of nef line bundles are described by a convex cone, and the possible contractions of the variety correspond to certain faces of the nef cone. In view of the correspondence between line bundles and divisors (built from codimension-1 subvarieties), there is an equivalent notion of a nef divisor.","image":"76b1c0988c54cf67b8101fff8e405c11f57b1764.svg","url":"Nef_line_bundle"}
