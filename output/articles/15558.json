{"title":"Tendril perversion","summary":"Tendril perversion is a geometric phenomenon sometimes observed in helical structures in which the direction of the helix transitions between left-handed and right-handed.[1] [2] Such a reversal of chirality is commonly seen in helical plant tendrils and telephone handset cords.[3]","image":"PSM_V17_D663_A_caught_tendril_of_bryonia_dioica.jpg.webp","url":"Tendril_perversion"}
