{"title":"Zarankiewicz problem","summary":"The Zarankiewicz problem, an unsolved problem in mathematics, asks for the largest possible number of edges in a bipartite graph that has a given number of vertices and has no complete bipartite subgraphs of a given size.[1] It belongs to the field of extremal graph theory, a branch of combinatorics, and is named after the Polish mathematician Kazimierz Zarankiewicz, who proposed several special cases of the problem in 1951.[2]","image":"8706ced2f82ab0a76fe854a7e375bf77b759fafa.svg","url":"Zarankiewicz_problem"}
