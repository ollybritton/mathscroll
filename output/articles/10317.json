{"title":"Menger space","summary":"In mathematics, a Menger space is a topological space that satisfies a certain basic selection principle that generalizes σ-compactness. A Menger space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers U 1 , U 2 , … {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {U}}_{1},{\\mathcal {U}}_{2},\\ldots } of the space there are finite sets F 1 ⊂ U 1 , F 2 ⊂ U 2 , … {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}_{1}\\subset {\\mathcal {U}}_{1},{\\mathcal {F}}_{2}\\subset {\\mathcal {U}}_{2},\\ldots } such that the family F 1 ∪ F 2 ∪ ⋯ {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}_{1}\\cup {\\mathcal {F}}_{2}\\cup \\cdots } covers the space.","image":"65ddf597330a38fd737d609d0549d4e8de1ade13.svg","url":"Menger_space"}
