{"title":"Cubic honeycomb","summary":"The cubic honeycomb or cubic cellulation is the only proper regular space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 3-space made up of cubic cells. It has 4 cubes around every edge, and 8 cubes around each vertex. Its vertex figure is a regular octahedron. It is a self-dual tessellation with Schl√§fli symbol {4,3,4}. John Horton Conway called this honeycomb a cubille.","image":"Cubic_honeycomb.png.webp","url":"Cubic_honeycomb"}
