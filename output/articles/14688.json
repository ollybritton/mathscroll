{"title":"Source unfolding","summary":"In computational geometry, the source unfolding of a convex polyhedron is a net obtained by cutting the polyhedron along the cut locus of a point on the surface of the polyhedron. The cut locus of a point p {\\displaystyle p} consists of all points on the surface that have two or more shortest geodesics to p {\\displaystyle p} . For every convex polyhedron, and every choice of the point p {\\displaystyle p} on its surface, cutting the polyhedron on the cut locus will produce a result that can be unfolded into a flat plane, producing the source unfolding. The resulting net may, however, cut across some of the faces of the polyhedron rather than only cutting along its edges.[1]","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Source_unfolding"}
