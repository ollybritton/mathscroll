{"title":"Hyperfinite type II factor","summary":"In mathematics, there are up to isomorphism exactly two separably acting hyperfinite type II factors; one infinite and one finite. Murray and von Neumann proved that up to isomorphism there is a unique von Neumann algebra that is a factor of type II1 and also hyperfinite; it is called the hyperfinite type II1 factor. There are an uncountable number of other factors of type II1. Connes proved that the infinite one is also unique.","image":"92d98b82a3778f043108d4e20960a9193df57cbf.svg","url":"Hyperfinite_type_II_factor"}
