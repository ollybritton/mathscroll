{"title":"Principal ideal","summary":"In mathematics, specifically ring theory, a principal ideal is an ideal I {\\displaystyle I} in a ring R {\\displaystyle R} that is generated by a single element a {\\displaystyle a} of R {\\displaystyle R} through multiplication by every element of R . {\\displaystyle R.} The term also has another, similar meaning in order theory, where it refers to an (order) ideal in a poset P {\\displaystyle P} generated by a single element x âˆˆ P , {\\displaystyle x\\in P,} which is to say the set of all elements less than or equal to x {\\displaystyle x} in P . {\\displaystyle P.}","image":"535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f.svg","url":"Principal_ideal"}
