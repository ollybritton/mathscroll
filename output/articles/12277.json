{"title":"Pokhozhaev's identity","summary":"Pokhozhaev's identity is an integral relation satisfied by stationary localized solutions to a nonlinear Schrödinger equation or nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation. It was obtained by S.I. Pokhozhaev[1] and is similar to the virial theorem. This relation is also known as D.H. Derrick's theorem. Similar identities can be derived for other equations of mathematical physics.","image":"a6330a52343a7c5f5a3e5e80cbd1104e57949f09.svg","url":"Pokhozhaev's_identity"}
