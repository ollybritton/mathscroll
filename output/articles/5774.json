{"title":"Frobenius reciprocity","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular representation theory, Frobenius reciprocity is a theorem expressing a duality between the process of restricting and inducting. It can be used to leverage knowledge about representations of a subgroup to find and classify representations of \"large\" groups that contain them. It is named for Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, the inventor of the representation theory of finite groups.","image":"bf718b324aefe099fc9e8746d5857a4cc8f203d3.svg","url":"Frobenius_reciprocity"}
