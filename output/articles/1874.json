{"title":"Borsuk–Ulam theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Borsuk–Ulam theorem states that every continuous function from an n-sphere into Euclidean n-space maps some pair of antipodal points to the same point. Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center.","image":"2d6c446e22a8bf3bff82045f5ad674a9397ae57d.svg","url":"Borsuk–Ulam_theorem"}
