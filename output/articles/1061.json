{"title":"Ascending chain condition on principal ideals","summary":"In abstract algebra, the ascending chain condition can be applied to the posets of principal left, principal right, or principal two-sided ideals of a ring, partially ordered by inclusion. The ascending chain condition on principal ideals (abbreviated to ACCP) is satisfied if there is no infinite strictly ascending chain of principal ideals of the given type (left/right/two-sided) in the ring, or said another way, every ascending chain is eventually constant.","image":"5de3d18759e109d4aecac8ecd7376befbccda5bc.svg","url":"Ascending_chain_condition_on_principal_ideals"}
