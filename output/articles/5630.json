{"title":"Fractal curve","summary":"A fractal curve is, loosely, a mathematical curve whose shape retains the same general pattern of irregularity, regardless of how high it is magnified, that is, its graph takes the form of a fractal.[1] In general, fractal curves are nowhere rectifiable curves — that is, they do not have finite length — and every subarc longer than a single point has infinite length.[2]","image":"Gosper_6.gif","url":"Fractal_curve"}
