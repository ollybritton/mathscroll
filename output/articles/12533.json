{"title":"Priority matching","summary":"In graph theory, a priority matching (also called: maximum priority matching) is a matching that maximizes the number of high-priority vertices that participate in the matching. Formally, we are given a graph G = (V, E), and a partition of the vertex-set V into some k subsets, V1, â€¦, Vk, called priority classes.  A priority matching is a matching that, among all possible matchings, saturates the largest number of vertices from V1; subject to this, it saturates the largest number of vertices from V2; subject to this, it saturates the largest number of vertices from V3; and so on.","image":"3aa31f974742d4ed55c3c091beecd0a633e30fa6.svg","url":"Priority_matching"}
