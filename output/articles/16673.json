{"title":"Volume of an n-ball","summary":"In geometry, a ball is a region in a space comprising all points within a fixed distance, called the radius, from a given point; that is, it is the region enclosed by a sphere or hypersphere. An n-ball is a ball in an n-dimensional Euclidean space. The volume of a n-ball is the Lebesgue measure of this ball, which generalizes to any dimension the usual volume of a ball in 3-dimensional space. The volume of a n-ball of radius R is R n V n , {\\displaystyle R^{n}V_{n},} where V n {\\displaystyle V_{n}} is the volume of the unit n-ball, the n-ball of radius 1.","image":"f59de30718ac9f95bd4670a9c3b85fb59bc4ec59.svg","url":"Volume_of_an_n-ball"}
