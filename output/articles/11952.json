{"title":"Pentagonal antiprism","summary":"In geometry, the pentagonal antiprism is the third in an infinite set of antiprisms formed by an even-numbered sequence of triangle sides closed by two polygon caps. It consists of two pentagons joined to each other by a ring of ten triangles for a total of twelve faces. Hence, it is a non-regular dodecahedron.","image":"Pentagonal_antiprism.png.webp","url":"Pentagonal_antiprism"}
