{"title":"Finite difference method","summary":"In numerical analysis, finite-difference methods (FDM) are a class of numerical techniques for solving differential equations by approximating derivatives with finite differences. Both the spatial domain and time interval (if applicable) are discretized, or broken into a finite number of steps, and the value of the solution at these discrete points is approximated by solving algebraic equations containing finite differences and values from nearby points.","image":"914de73645542676cfad7bd9e16c93970a2ece1b.svg","url":"Finite_difference_method"}
