{"title":"Structural rule","summary":"In proof theory, a structural rule is an inference rule that does not refer to any logical connective, but instead operates on the judgment or sequents directly. Structural rules often mimic intended meta-theoretic properties of the logic. Logics that deny one or more of the structural rules are classified as substructural logics.","image":"3d98f929cedea3211d541cb3ec8ca51225f560d7.svg","url":"Structural_rule"}
