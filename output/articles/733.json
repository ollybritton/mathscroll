{"title":"An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism","summary":"An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism[1][2] is a fundamental publication by George Green in 1828, where he extends previous work of Sim√©on Denis Poisson on electricity and magnetism. The work in mathematical analysis, notably including what is now universally known as Green's theorem, is of the greatest importance in all branches of mathematical physics. It contains the first exposition of the theory of potential. In physics, Green's theorem is mostly used to solve two-dimensional flow integrals, stating that the sum of fluid outflows at any point inside a volume is equal to the total outflow summed about an enclosing area. In plane geometry, and in particular, area surveying, Green's theorem can be used to determine the area and centroid of plane figures solely by integrating over the perimeter.","image":"GreenEssay.png.webp","url":"An_Essay_on_the_Application_of_Mathematical_Analysis_to_the_Theories_of_Electricity_and_Magnetism"}
