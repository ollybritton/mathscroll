{"title":"Jyā, koti-jyā and utkrama-jyā","summary":"Jyā, koṭi-jyā and  utkrama-jyā are three trigonometric functions introduced  by Indian mathematicians and astronomers. The earliest known Indian treatise containing references to these functions is Surya Siddhanta.[1] These are functions of arcs of circles and not functions of angles. Jyā and koti-jyā are closely related to the modern trigonometric functions of sine and cosine. In fact, the origins of the modern terms of \"sine\" and \"cosine\" have been  traced back to the Sanskrit words jyā and koti-jyā.[1]","image":"Modern_diagram_for_jya_and_kojya.svg.png.webp","url":"Jyā,_koti-jyā_and_utkrama-jyā"}
