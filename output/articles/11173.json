{"title":"Noncototient","summary":"In mathematics, a noncototient is a positive integer n that cannot be expressed as the difference between a positive integer m and the number of coprime integers below it. That is, m − φ(m) = n, where φ stands for Euler's totient function, has no solution for m.  The cototient of n is defined as n − φ(n), so a noncototient is a number that is never a cototient.","image":"673732627b1e37e8ecb7f35dce2fc9bd31673894.svg","url":"Noncototient"}
