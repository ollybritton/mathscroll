{"title":"GF(2)","summary":"GF(2) (also denoted F 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{2}} , Z/2Z or Z / 2 Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} /2\\mathbb {Z} } ) is the finite field of two elements (GF is the initialism of Galois field, another name for finite fields). Notations Z2 and Z 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} _{2}} may be encountered although they can be confused with the notation of 2-adic integers.","image":"fde97f1e971e76227cd0aac645b7b0901d7b668d.svg","url":"GF(2)"}
