{"title":"Okubo algebra","summary":"In algebra, an Okubo algebra or pseudo-octonion algebra is an 8-dimensional non-associative algebra similar to the one studied by Susumu Okubo.[1] Okubo algebras are composition algebras, flexible algebras (A(BA) = (AB)A), Lie admissible algebras, and power associative, but are not associative, not alternative algebras, and do not have an identity element.","image":"27f1a253009f7d963eefdbac91e5e67757920e05.svg","url":"Okubo_algebra"}
