{"title":"CUR matrix approximation","summary":"A CUR matrix approximation is a set of three matrices that, when multiplied together, closely approximate a given matrix.[1][2][3] A CUR approximation can be used in the same way as the low-rank approximation of the singular value decomposition (SVD).  CUR approximations are less accurate than the SVD, but they offer two key advantages, both stemming from the fact that the rows and columns come from the original matrix (rather than left and right singular vectors):","image":"103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8.svg","url":"CUR_matrix_approximation"}
