{"title":"Spectral theory","summary":"In mathematics, spectral theory is an inclusive term for theories extending the eigenvector and eigenvalue theory of a single square matrix to a much broader theory of the structure of operators in a variety of mathematical spaces.[1] It is a result of studies of linear algebra and the solutions of systems of linear equations and their generalizations.[2] The theory is connected to that of analytic functions because the spectral properties of an operator are related to analytic functions of the spectral parameter.[3]","image":"3df720f3e0f19aacf6c9894ebeb0a4c6a8964e40.svg","url":"Spectral_theory"}
