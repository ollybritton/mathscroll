{"title":"Tarski–Grothendieck set theory","summary":"Tarski–Grothendieck set theory (TG, named after mathematicians Alfred Tarski and Alexander Grothendieck) is an axiomatic set theory.  It is a non-conservative extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC) and is distinguished from other axiomatic set theories by the inclusion of Tarski's axiom, which states that for each set there is a Grothendieck universe it belongs to (see below). Tarski's axiom implies the existence of inaccessible cardinals, providing a richer ontology than ZFC.  For example, adding this axiom supports category theory.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Tarski–Grothendieck_set_theory"}
