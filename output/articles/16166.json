{"title":"Truncated order-7 triangular tiling","summary":"In geometry, the order-7 truncated triangular tiling, sometimes called the hyperbolic soccerball,[1] is a semiregular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. There are two hexagons and one heptagon on each vertex, forming a pattern similar to a conventional soccer ball (truncated icosahedron) with heptagons in place of pentagons. It has Schl√§fli symbol of t{3,7}.","image":"Truncated_order-7_triangular_tiling.svg.png.webp","url":"Truncated_order-7_triangular_tiling"}
