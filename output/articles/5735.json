{"title":"Frequency","summary":"Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time.[1] It is also occasionally referred to as temporal frequency for clarity, and is distinct from angular frequency. Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz) which is equal to one event per second.  The period is the interval of time between events, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency.[2]","image":"ลูกตุ้มธรรมชาติ.gif","url":"Frequency"}
