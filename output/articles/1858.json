{"title":"Borel subgroup","summary":"In the theory of algebraic groups, a Borel subgroup of an algebraic group G is a maximal Zariski closed and connected solvable algebraic subgroup. For example, in the general linear group GLn (n x n invertible matrices), the subgroup of invertible upper triangular matrices is a Borel subgroup.","image":"E8Petrie.svg.png.webp","url":"Borel_subgroup"}
