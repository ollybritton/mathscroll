{"title":"Cox's theorem","summary":"Cox's theorem, named after the physicist Richard Threlkeld Cox, is a derivation of the laws of probability theory from a certain set of postulates.[1][2] This derivation justifies the so-called \"logical\" interpretation of probability, as the laws of probability derived by Cox's theorem are applicable to any proposition. Logical (also known as objective Bayesian) probability is a type of Bayesian probability. Other forms of Bayesianism, such as the subjective interpretation, are given other justifications.","image":"Bayes_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Cox's_theorem"}
