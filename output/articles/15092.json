{"title":"Stochastic portfolio theory","summary":"Stochastic portfolio theory (SPT) is a mathematical theory for analyzing stock market structure and portfolio behavior introduced by E. Robert Fernholz in 2002.  It is descriptive as opposed to normative, and is consistent with the observed behavior of actual markets.  Normative assumptions, which serve as a basis for earlier theories like modern portfolio theory (MPT) and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), are absent from SPT.","image":"9ac165852948373306c3cb0104f66de8d8e0f41d.svg","url":"Stochastic_portfolio_theory"}
