{"title":"Reduction (computability theory)","summary":"In computability theory, many reducibility relations (also called reductions, reducibilities, and notions of reducibility) are studied. They are motivated by the question: given sets A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} of natural numbers, is it possible to effectively convert a method for deciding membership in B {\\displaystyle B} into a method for deciding membership in A {\\displaystyle A} ?  If the answer to this question is affirmative then A {\\displaystyle A} is said to be reducible to B {\\displaystyle B} .","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Reduction_(computability_theory)"}
