{"title":"Tautological ring","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the tautological ring is the subring of the Chow ring of the moduli space of curves generated by tautological classes. These are classes obtained from 1 by pushforward along various morphisms described below. The tautological cohomology ring is the image of the tautological ring under the cycle map (from the Chow ring to the cohomology ring).","image":"ff046dabef58c8bc347ae6626495acda388f02c9.svg","url":"Tautological_ring"}
