{"title":"Conductor (class field theory)","summary":"In algebraic number theory, the conductor of a finite abelian extension of local or global fields provides a quantitative measure of the ramification in the extension. The definition of the conductor is related to the Artin map.","image":"137a2be4fead603ed58f3128c63c95df7f148e16.svg","url":"Conductor_(class_field_theory)"}
