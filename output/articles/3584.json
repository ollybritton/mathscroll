{"title":"Crossing number inequality","summary":"In the mathematics of graph drawing, the crossing number inequality or crossing lemma gives a lower bound on the minimum number of edge crossings in a plane drawing of a given graph, as a function of the number of edges and vertices of the graph. It states that, for graphs where the number e of edges is sufficiently larger than the number n of vertices, the crossing number is at least proportional to e3/n2.","image":"052eca85d657fee9d8a23538269fd505d7a86cd8.svg","url":"Crossing_number_inequality"}
