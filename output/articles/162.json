{"title":"Fubini's theorem","summary":"In mathematical analysis Fubini's theorem is a result that gives conditions under which it is possible to compute a double integral by using an iterated integral, introduced by Guido Fubini in 1907. One may switch the order of integration if the double integral yields a finite answer when the integrand is replaced by its absolute value.","image":"68d428f0c71bcde33a85337f71dbb3c1cfdff947.svg","url":"A%2fFubini's_theorem"}
