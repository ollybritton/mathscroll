{"title":"Loop integral","summary":"In quantum field theory and statistical mechanics, loop integrals are the integrals which appear when evaluating the Feynman diagrams with one or more loops by integrating over the internal momenta.[1] These integrals are used to determine counterterms, which in turn allow evaluation of the beta function, which encodes the dependence of coupling g {\\displaystyle g} for an interaction on an energy scale Î¼ {\\displaystyle \\mu } .","image":"d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77.svg","url":"Loop_integral"}
