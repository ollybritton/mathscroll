{"title":"Black-oil equations","summary":"The black-oil equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe fluid flow in a petroleum reservoir, constituting the mathematical framework for a black-oil reservoir simulator.[1] The term black-oil refers to the fluid model, in which water is modeled explicitly together with two hydrocarbon components, one (pseudo) oil phase and one (pseudo-)gas phase. This is in contrast with a compositional formulation, in which each hydrocarbon component (arbitrary number) is handled separately.","image":"ac1000e89b0757e377307ebbc12890e7aa32b69c.svg","url":"Black-oil_equations"}
