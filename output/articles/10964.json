{"title":"Navier–Stokes equations","summary":"The Navier–Stokes equations (/nævˈjeɪ stoʊks/ nav-YAY STOHKS) are partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes.  They were developed over several decades of progressively building the theories, from 1822 (Navier) to 1842-1850 (Stokes).","image":"Claude-Louis_Navier.jpg.webp","url":"Navier–Stokes_equations"}
