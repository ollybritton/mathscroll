{"title":"Join and meet","summary":"In mathematics, specifically order theory, the join of a subset S {\\displaystyle S} of a partially ordered set P {\\displaystyle P} is the supremum (least upper bound) of S , {\\displaystyle S,} denoted ⋁ S , {\\textstyle \\bigvee S,} and similarly, the meet of S {\\displaystyle S} is the infimum (greatest lower bound), denoted ⋀ S . {\\textstyle \\bigwedge S.} In general, the join and meet of a subset of a partially ordered set need not exist. Join and meet are dual to one another with respect to order inversion.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Join_and_meet"}
