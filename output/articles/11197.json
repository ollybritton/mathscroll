{"title":"Nonstandard finite difference scheme","summary":"Nonstandard finite difference schemes is a general set of methods in numerical analysis that gives numerical solutions to differential equations by constructing a discrete model. The general rules for such schemes are not precisely known.[1][2]","image":"531cd6996427b3a9e3b43227ba024a55954450e1.svg","url":"Nonstandard_finite_difference_scheme"}
