{"title":"Dirac operator","summary":"In mathematics and quantum mechanics, a Dirac operator is a differential operator that is a formal square root, or half-iterate, of a second-order operator such as a Laplacian. The original case which concerned Paul Dirac was to factorise formally an operator for Minkowski space, to get a form of quantum theory compatible with special relativity; to get the relevant Laplacian as a product of first-order operators he introduced spinors. It was first published in 1928.","image":"33458006f13a86f96d7826a6ca6c22fa29fbbe95.svg","url":"Dirac_operator"}
