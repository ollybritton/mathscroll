{"title":"Dirac algebra","summary":"In mathematical physics, the Dirac algebra is the Clifford algebra Cl 1 , 3 ( C ) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Cl}}_{1,3}(\\mathbb {C} )} . This was introduced by the mathematical physicist P. A. M. Dirac in 1928 in developing the Dirac equation for spin-Â½ particles with a matrix representation of the gamma matrices, which represent the generators of the algebra.","image":"51b43355aee8e51a6204248aa1ee813232a0ccc0.svg","url":"Dirac_algebra"}
