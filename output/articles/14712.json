{"title":"Sparse matrix","summary":"In numerical analysis and scientific computing, a sparse matrix or sparse array is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero.[1] There is no strict definition regarding the proportion of zero-value elements for a matrix to qualify as sparse but a common criterion is that the number of non-zero elements is roughly equal to the number of rows or columns. By contrast, if most of the elements are non-zero, the matrix is considered dense.[1] The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., m × n for an m × n matrix) is sometimes referred to as the sparsity of the matrix.","image":"6f9ffcea50d5da4133ded17f526333fdda87f702.svg","url":"Sparse_matrix"}
