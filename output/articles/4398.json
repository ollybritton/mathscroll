{"title":"Dominated convergence theorem","summary":"In measure theory, Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem provides sufficient conditions under which almost everywhere convergence of a sequence of functions implies convergence in the L1 norm. Its power and utility are two of the primary theoretical advantages of Lebesgue integration over Riemann integration.","image":"a32c571f35fd41f5ef78fecc130ac39cd2108c8c.svg","url":"Dominated_convergence_theorem"}
