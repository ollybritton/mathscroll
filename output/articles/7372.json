{"title":"Homomorphic secret sharing","summary":"In cryptography, homomorphic secret sharing is a type of secret sharing algorithm in which the secret is encrypted via homomorphic encryption. A homomorphism is a transformation from one algebraic structure into another of the same type so that the structure is preserved. Importantly, this means that for every kind of manipulation of the original data, there is a corresponding manipulation of the transformed data.[1]","image":"Homomorphic_secret_sharing%2C_voting_example.svg.png.webp","url":"Homomorphic_secret_sharing"}
