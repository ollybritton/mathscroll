{"title":"Direct multiple shooting method","summary":"In the area of mathematics known as numerical ordinary differential equations, the direct multiple shooting method is a numerical method for the solution of boundary value problems. The method divides the interval over which a solution is sought into several smaller intervals, solves an initial value problem in each of the smaller intervals, and imposes additional matching conditions to form a solution on the whole interval. The method constitutes a significant improvement in distribution of nonlinearity and numerical stability over single shooting methods.","image":"b1131aa2f96ea553a6e4124b6fd708c0729e1b01.svg","url":"Direct_multiple_shooting_method"}
