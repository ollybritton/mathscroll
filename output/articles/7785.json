{"title":"Inflection point","summary":"In differential calculus and differential geometry, an inflection point, point of inflection, flex, or inflection (British English: inflexion) is a point on a smooth plane curve at which the curvature changes sign. In particular, in the case of the graph of a function, it is a point where the function changes from being concave (concave downward) to convex (concave upward), or vice versa.","image":"X_cubed_plot.svg.png.webp","url":"Inflection_point"}
