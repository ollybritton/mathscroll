{"title":"Ignorability","summary":"In statistics, ignorability is a feature of an experiment design whereby the method of data collection (and the nature of missing data) does not depend on the missing data.  A missing data mechanism such as a treatment assignment or survey sampling strategy is \"ignorable\" if the missing data matrix, which indicates which variables are observed or missing, is independent of the missing data conditional on the observed data.","image":"2a80a4a29becc4e72d81c56c8e463cf0b2e5fd78.svg","url":"Ignorability"}
