{"title":"Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature","summary":"Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature and Fejér quadrature are methods for numerical integration, or \"quadrature\", that are based on an expansion of the integrand in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. Equivalently, they employ a change of variables x = cos ⁡ θ {\\displaystyle x=\\cos \\theta } and use a discrete cosine transform (DCT) approximation for the cosine series.  Besides having fast-converging accuracy comparable to Gaussian quadrature rules, Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature naturally leads to nested quadrature rules (where different accuracy orders share points), which is important for both adaptive quadrature and multidimensional quadrature (cubature).","image":"71c5f4024d72473459e4112d726b2eab01cefb44.svg","url":"Clenshaw–Curtis_quadrature"}
