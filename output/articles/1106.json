{"title":"atan2","summary":"In computing and mathematics, the function atan2 is the 2-argument arctangent. By definition, θ = atan2 ⁡ ( y , x ) {\\displaystyle \\theta =\\operatorname {atan2} (y,x)} is the angle measure (in radians, with − π < θ ≤ π {\\displaystyle -\\pi <\\theta \\leq \\pi } ) between the positive x {\\displaystyle x} -axis and the ray from the origin to the point ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle (x,\\,y)} in the Cartesian plane. Equivalently, atan2 ⁡ ( y , x ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {atan2} (y,x)} is the argument (also called phase or angle) of the complex number x + i y . {\\displaystyle x+iy.}","image":"4b7d5a358984daf9513bd73ca49874b36b2cb905.svg","url":"Atan2"}
