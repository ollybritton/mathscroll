{"title":"Conservative vector field","summary":"In vector calculus, a conservative vector field is a vector field that is the gradient of some function.[1] A conservative vector field has the property that its line integral is path independent; the choice of any path between two points does not change the value of the line integral. Path independence of the line integral is equivalent to the vector field under the line integral being conservative. A conservative vector field is also irrotational; in three dimensions, this means that it has vanishing curl. An irrotational vector field is necessarily conservative provided that the domain is simply connected.","image":"ade77782ac941cec196a97d5fc63ad0e74ecb826.svg","url":"Conservative_vector_field"}
