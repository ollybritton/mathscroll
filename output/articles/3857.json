{"title":"Decision problem","summary":"In computability theory and computational complexity theory, a decision problem is a computational problem that can be posed as a yesâ€“no question of the input values. An example of a decision problem is deciding by means of an algorithm whether a given natural number is prime. Another is the problem \"given two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y?\".  The answer is either 'yes' or 'no' depending upon the values of x and y. A method for solving a decision problem, given in the form of an algorithm, is called a decision procedure for that problem. A decision procedure for the decision problem \"given two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y?\" would give the steps for determining whether x evenly divides y. One such algorithm is long division. If the remainder is zero the answer is 'yes', otherwise it is 'no'. A decision problem which can be solved by an algorithm is called decidable.","image":"Decision_Problem.svg.png.webp","url":"Decision_problem"}
