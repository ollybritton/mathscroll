{"title":"Strip packing problem","summary":"The strip packing problem is a 2-dimensional geometric minimization problem. Given a set of axis-aligned rectangles and a strip of bounded width and infinite height, determine an overlapping-free packing of the rectangles into the strip minimizing its height. This problem is a cutting and packing problem and is classified as an Open Dimension Problem according to WÃ¤scher et al.[1]","image":"9a94d2d02968e6cbbc338b54f7762ccd20d74805.svg","url":"Strip_packing_problem"}
