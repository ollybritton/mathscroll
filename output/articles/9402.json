{"title":"Link prediction","summary":"In network theory, link prediction is the problem of predicting the existence of a link between two entities in a network. Examples of link prediction include predicting friendship links among users in a social network, predicting co-authorship links in a citation network, and predicting interactions between genes and proteins in a biological network. Link prediction can also have a temporal aspect, where, given a snapshot of the set of links at time t {\\displaystyle t} , the goal is to predict the links at time t + 1 {\\displaystyle t+1} . Link prediction is widely applicable. In e-commerce, link prediction is often a subtask for recommending items to users. In the curation of citation databases, it can be used for record deduplication. In bioinformatics, it has been used to predict protein-protein interactions (PPI). It is also used to identify hidden groups of terrorists and criminals in security related applications.[1]","image":"65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560.svg","url":"Link_prediction"}
