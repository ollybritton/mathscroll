{"title":"De Sitter space","summary":"In mathematical physics, n-dimensional deÂ Sitter space (often abbreviated to dSn) is a maximally symmetric Lorentzian manifold with constant positive scalar curvature. It is the Lorentzian analogue of an n-sphere (with its canonical Riemannian metric).","image":"0ac0a4a98a414e3480335f9ba652d12571ec6733.svg","url":"De_Sitter_space"}
