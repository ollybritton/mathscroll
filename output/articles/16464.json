{"title":"Upwind scheme","summary":"In computational physics, the term upwind scheme (sometimes advection scheme) typically refers to a class of numerical discretization methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations, in which so-called upstream variables are used to calculate the derivatives in a flow field. That is, derivatives are estimated using a set of data points biased to be more \"upwind\" of the query point, with respect to the direction of the flow. Historically, the origin of upwind methods can be traced back to the work of Courant, Isaacson, and Rees who proposed the CIR method.[1]","image":"0c918435dcb97d9b656574b27f50dab87c6acfd8.svg","url":"Upwind_scheme"}
