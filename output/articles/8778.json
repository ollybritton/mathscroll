{"title":"Kobayashi–Hitchin correspondence","summary":"In differential geometry, algebraic geometry, and gauge theory, the Kobayashi–Hitchin correspondence (or Donaldson–Uhlenbeck–Yau theorem) relates stable vector bundles over a complex manifold to Einstein–Hermitian vector bundles. The correspondence is named after Shoshichi Kobayashi and Nigel Hitchin, who independently conjectured in the 1980s that the moduli spaces of stable vector bundles and Einstein–Hermitian vector bundles over a complex manifold were essentially the same.[1][2]","image":"8ca6d69e098703dc3ea9dd6a19d24b9c9fe840d6.svg","url":"Kobayashi–Hitchin_correspondence"}
