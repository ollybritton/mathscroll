{"title":"Guyan reduction","summary":"In computational mechanics, Guyan reduction,[1] also known as static condensation, is a dimensionality reduction method which reduces the number of degrees of freedom by ignoring the inertial terms of the equilibrium equations and expressing the unloaded degrees of freedom in terms of the loaded degrees of freedom.","image":"3dc44d6941354bd90cb634fa9c97ec7912b50f84.svg","url":"Guyan_reduction"}
