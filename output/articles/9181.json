{"title":"Lelong number","summary":"In mathematics, the Lelong number is an invariant of a point of a complex analytic variety that in some sense measures the local density at that point.  It was introduced by LelongÂ (1957). More generally a closed positive (p,p) current u on a complex manifold has a Lelong number n(u,x) for each point x of the manifold. Similarly a plurisubharmonic function also has a Lelong number at a point.","image":"0e33676441079b32ee8c48a5e9c06dbe8bc1c833.svg","url":"Lelong_number"}
