{"title":"Compact Lie algebra","summary":"In the mathematical field of Lie theory, there are two definitions of a compact Lie algebra. Extrinsically and topologically, a compact Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group;[1] this definition includes tori. Intrinsically and algebraically, a compact Lie algebra is a real Lie algebra whose Killing form is negative definite; this definition is more restrictive and excludes tori,.[2] A compact Lie algebra can be seen as the smallest real form of a corresponding complex Lie algebra, namely the complexification.","image":"E8Petrie.svg.png.webp","url":"Compact_Lie_algebra"}
