{"title":"Discontinuities of monotone functions","summary":"In the mathematical field of analysis, a well-known theorem describes the set of discontinuities of a monotone real-valued function of a real variable; all discontinuities of such a (monotone) function are necessarily jump discontinuities and there are at most countably many of them.","image":"6fdc4638c5f8efcfdb3512aca061defd5f0b9d7d.svg","url":"Discontinuities_of_monotone_functions"}
