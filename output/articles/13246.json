{"title":"Redfield equation","summary":"In quantum mechanics, the Redfield equation is a Markovian master equation that describes the time evolution of the reduced density matrix œÅ of a strongly coupled quantum system that is weakly coupled to an environment. The equation is named in honor of Alfred G. Redfield, who first applied it, doing so for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.[1]","image":"0617b2d833d22c133f9da26c156caeca980539e4.svg","url":"Redfield_equation"}
