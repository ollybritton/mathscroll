{"title":"Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)","summary":"Carathéodory's theorem is a theorem in convex geometry. It states that if a point x {\\displaystyle x} lies in the convex hull C o n v ( P ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Conv} (P)} of a set P ⊂ R d {\\displaystyle P\\subset \\mathbb {R} ^{d}} , then x {\\displaystyle x} can be written as the convex combination of at most d + 1 {\\displaystyle d+1} points in P {\\displaystyle P} . More sharply, x {\\displaystyle x} can be written as the convex combination of at most d + 1 {\\displaystyle d+1} extremal points in P {\\displaystyle P} , as non-extremal points can be removed from P {\\displaystyle P} without changing the membership of x {\\displaystyle x} in the convex hull.","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Carathéodory's_theorem_(convex_hull)"}
