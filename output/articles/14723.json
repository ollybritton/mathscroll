{"title":"Special conformal transformation","summary":"In projective geometry, a special conformal transformation is a linear fractional transformation that is not an affine transformation. Thus the generation of a special conformal transformation involves use of multiplicative inversion, which is the generator of linear fractional transformations that is not affine.","image":"Conformal_grid_before_MÃ¶bius_transformation.svg.png.webp","url":"Special_conformal_transformation"}
