{"title":"Exponential-logarithmic distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the Exponential-Logarithmic (EL) distribution is a family of lifetime distributions with decreasing failure rate, defined on the interval [0, ∞). This distribution is parameterized by two parameters p ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) {\\displaystyle p\\in (0,1)} and β > 0 {\\displaystyle \\beta >0} .","image":"139f72fc2fc3c385635992a8764c0eccd77a3913.svg","url":"Exponential-logarithmic_distribution"}
