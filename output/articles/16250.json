{"title":"Twelvefold way","summary":"In combinatorics, the twelvefold way is a systematic classification of 12 related enumerative problems concerning two finite sets, which include the classical problems of counting permutations, combinations, multisets, and partitions either of a set or of a number. The idea of the classification is credited to Gian-Carlo Rota, and the name was suggested by Joel Spencer.[1]","image":"8026b98926e803da654ebfa87ff4a9911ca21ce4.svg","url":"Twelvefold_way"}
