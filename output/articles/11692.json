{"title":"PCF theory","summary":"PCF theory is the name of a mathematical theory, introduced by Saharon ShelahÂ (1978), that deals with the cofinality of the ultraproducts of ordered sets. It gives strong upper bounds on the cardinalities of power sets of singular cardinals, and has many more applications as well. The abbreviation \"PCF\" stands for \"possible cofinalities\".","image":"47ee3a662e76c97680f75e6d45f5de45e29ea169.svg","url":"PCF_theory"}
