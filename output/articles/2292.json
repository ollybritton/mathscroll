{"title":"Cartesian tensor","summary":"In geometry and linear algebra, a Cartesian tensor uses an orthonormal basis to represent a tensor in a Euclidean space in the form of components. Converting a tensor's components from one such basis to another is through an orthogonal transformation.","image":"Rectangular_coordinate_systems_index_lowered.svg.png.webp","url":"Cartesian_tensor"}
