{"title":"Modulation space","summary":"Modulation spaces[1] are a family of Banach spaces defined by the behavior of the short-time Fourier transform with respect to a test function from the Schwartz space. They were originally proposed by Hans Georg Feichtinger and are recognized to be the right kind of function spaces for time-frequency analysis. Feichtinger's algebra, while originally introduced as a new Segal algebra,[2] is identical to a certain modulation space and has become a widely used space of test functions for time-frequency analysis.","image":"619dde51a6203901e6bfaafef50b553b33a0eba6.svg","url":"Modulation_space"}
