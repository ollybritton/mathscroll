{"title":"Orientation (vector space)","summary":"The orientation of a real vector space or simply orientation of a vector space is the arbitrary choice of which ordered bases are \"positively\" oriented and which are \"negatively\" oriented. In the three-dimensional Euclidean space, right-handed bases are typically declared to be positively oriented, but the choice is arbitrary, as they may also be assigned a negative orientation. A vector space with an orientation selected is called an oriented vector space, while one not having an orientation selected, is called .mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#b1d2ff}unoriented.","image":"Cartesian_coordinate_system_handedness.svg.png.webp","url":"Orientation_(vector_space)"}
