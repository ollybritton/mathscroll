Heston, is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of the volatility of an underlying asset.[1] It is a stochastic volatility model: such a model assumes that the volatility of the asset is not constant, nor even deterministic, but follows a random process.","image":"3bae0a5b0d185ac436c6dab34e2b0838d4cd1f65.svg","url":"Heston_model"}
