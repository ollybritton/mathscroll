{"title":"Mazur manifold","summary":"In differential topology, a branch of mathematics, a Mazur manifold is a contractible, compact, smooth four-dimensional manifold (with boundary) which is not diffeomorphic to the standard 4-ball.  The boundary of a Mazur manifold is necessarily a homology 3-sphere.","image":"586a773f3ae6b9be9de188c54371bc393afb72df.svg","url":"Mazur_manifold"}
