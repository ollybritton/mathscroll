{"title":"Acyclic coloring","summary":"In graph theory, an acyclic coloring is a (proper) vertex coloring in which every 2-chromatic subgraph is acyclic. The acyclic chromatic number A(G) of a graph G is the fewest colors needed in any acyclic coloring of G.","image":"Acyclic_coloring.svg.png.webp","url":"Acyclic_coloring"}
