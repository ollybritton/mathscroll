{"title":"Gauss's principle of least constraint","summary":"The principle of least constraint is one variational formulation of classical mechanics enunciated by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1829, equivalent to all other formulations of analytical mechanics. Intuitively, it says that the acceleration of a constrained physical system will be as similar as possible to that of the corresponding unconstrained system.[1]","image":"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss.jpg.webp","url":"Gauss's_principle_of_least_constraint"}
