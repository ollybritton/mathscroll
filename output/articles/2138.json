{"title":"Calculus of constructions","summary":"In mathematical logic and computer science, the calculus of constructions (CoC) is a type theory created by Thierry Coquand. It can serve as both a typed programming language and as constructive foundation for mathematics. For this second reason, the CoC and its variants have been the basis for Coq and other proof assistants.","image":"9593e3b995a1b57c078873a5ea186c7012e1a5ee.svg","url":"Calculus_of_constructions"}
