{"title":"Product measure","summary":"In mathematics, given two measurable spaces and measures on them, one can obtain a product measurable space and a product measure on that space. Conceptually, this is similar to defining the Cartesian product of sets and the product topology of two topological spaces, except that there can be many natural choices for the product measure.","image":"0bdaed76b2a06f855b737e0fb8dee0d66fa9f50d.svg","url":"Product_measure"}
