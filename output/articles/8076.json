{"title":"Isoperimetric dimension","summary":"In mathematics, the isoperimetric dimension of a manifold is a notion of dimension that tries to capture how the large-scale behavior of the manifold resembles that of a Euclidean space (unlike the topological dimension or the Hausdorff dimension which compare different local behaviors against those of the Euclidean space).","image":"0e0eed96bc7587c5da847394dac1279a866e093c.svg","url":"Isoperimetric_dimension"}
