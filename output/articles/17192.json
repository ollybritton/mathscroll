{"title":"Zonal spherical harmonics","summary":"In the mathematical study of rotational symmetry, the zonal spherical harmonics are special spherical harmonics that are invariant under the rotation through a particular fixed axis.  The zonal spherical functions are a broad extension of the notion of zonal spherical harmonics to allow for a more general symmetry group.","image":"22c7c4c135c5f3a50f853f4fca606f600acdc25b.svg","url":"Zonal_spherical_harmonics"}
