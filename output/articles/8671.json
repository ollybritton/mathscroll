{"title":"Kernel (category theory)","summary":"In category theory and its applications to other branches of mathematics, kernels are a generalization of the kernels of group homomorphisms, the kernels of module homomorphisms and certain other kernels from algebra. Intuitively, the kernel of the morphism f : X → Y is the \"most general\" morphism k : K → X that yields zero when composed with (followed by) f.","image":"First_property_of_the_kernel.svg.png.webp","url":"Kernel_(category_theory)"}
