{"title":"HOSVD-based canonical form of TP functions and qLPV models","summary":"Based on the key idea of higher-order singular value decomposition[1] (HOSVD) in tensor algebra, Baranyi and Yam proposed the concept of HOSVD-based canonical form of TP functions and quasi-LPV system models.[2][3] Szeidl et al.[4] proved that the TP model transformation[5][6] is capable of numerically reconstructing this canonical form.","image":"249f285cc9cbb0042e2774084723a22493411c9e.svg","url":"HOSVD-based_canonical_form_of_TP_functions_and_qLPV_models"}
