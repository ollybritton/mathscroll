{"title":"Rectification (geometry)","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, rectification, also known as critical truncation or complete-truncation, is the process of truncating a polytope by marking the midpoints of all its edges, and cutting off its vertices at those points.[1] The resulting polytope will be bounded by vertex figure facets and the rectified facets of the original polytope.","image":"Cuboctahedron.png.webp","url":"Rectification_(geometry)"}
