{"title":"Category of manifolds","summary":"In mathematics, the category of manifolds, often denoted Manp, is the category whose objects are manifolds of smoothness class Cp and whose morphisms are p-times continuously differentiable maps. This is a category because the composition of two Cp maps is again continuous and of class Cp.","image":"88c678aa412ba4868901603926546be5d24791ba.svg","url":"Category_of_manifolds"}
