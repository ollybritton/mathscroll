{"title":"Prime model","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular model theory,[1] a prime model is a model that is as simple as possible.  Specifically, a model P {\\displaystyle P} is prime if it admits an elementary embedding into any model M {\\displaystyle M} to which it is elementarily equivalent (that is, into any model M {\\displaystyle M} satisfying the same complete theory as P {\\displaystyle P} ).","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Prime_model"}
