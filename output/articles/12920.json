{"title":"Quasi-set theory","summary":"Quasi-set theory is a formal mathematical theory for dealing with collections of objects, some of which may be indistinguishable from one another. Quasi-set theory is mainly motivated by the assumption that certain objects treated in quantum physics are indistinguishable and don't have individuality.","image":"60c97604f32edfbe68216db8a6768060202c6220.svg","url":"Quasi-set_theory"}
