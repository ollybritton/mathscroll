{"title":"Mellin transform","summary":"In mathematics, the Mellin transform is an integral transform that may be regarded as the multiplicative version of the two-sided Laplace transform. This integral transform is closely connected to the theory of Dirichlet series, and is often used in number theory, mathematical statistics, and the theory of asymptotic expansions; it is closely related to the Laplace transform and the Fourier transform, and the theory of the gamma function and allied special functions.","image":"76b08022fe82ff5e8b9983274495ac47fa13385c.svg","url":"Mellin_transform"}
