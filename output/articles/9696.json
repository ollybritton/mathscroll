{"title":"Looman–Menchoff theorem","summary":"In the mathematical field of complex analysis, the Looman–Menchoff theorem states that a continuous complex-valued function defined in an open set of the complex plane is holomorphic if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations.  It is thus a generalization of a theorem by Édouard Goursat, which instead of assuming the continuity of f, assumes its Fréchet differentiability when regarded as a function from a subset of R2 to R2.","image":"2e0348db92adbb9ec79edb81090d978ecf3ff528.svg","url":"Looman–Menchoff_theorem"}
