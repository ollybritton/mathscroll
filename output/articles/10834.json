{"title":"Multiset","summary":"In mathematics, a multiset (or bag, or mset) is a modification of the concept of a set that, unlike a set,[1] allows for multiple instances for each of its elements. The number of instances given for each element is called the multiplicity of that element in the multiset. As a consequence, an infinite number of multisets exist which contain only elements a and b, but vary in the multiplicities of their elements:","image":"39ba69d205474ea8bc3461863ca3353dbf67110d.svg","url":"Multiset"}
