{"title":"Depth (ring theory)","summary":"In commutative and homological algebra, depth is an important invariant of rings and modules. Although depth can be defined more generally, the most common case considered is the case of modules over a commutative Noetherian local ring. In this case, the depth of a module is related with its projective dimension by the Auslanderâ€“Buchsbaum formula. A more elementary property of depth is the inequality","image":"db8999b3cfab48d1783ab1ee606640b7f3d23f6f.svg","url":"Depth_(ring_theory)"}
