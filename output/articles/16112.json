{"title":"Truncated 16-cell honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the truncated 16-cell honeycomb (or cantic tesseractic honeycomb) is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 4-space. It is constructed by 24-cell and truncated 16-cell facets.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Truncated_16-cell_honeycomb"}
