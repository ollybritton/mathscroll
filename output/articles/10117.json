{"title":"Mathematics of general relativity","summary":"When studying and formulating Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, various mathematical structures and techniques are utilized. The main tools used in this geometrical theory of gravitation are tensor fields defined on a Lorentzian manifold representing spacetime. This article is a general description of the mathematics of general relativity.","image":"Spacetime_lattice_analogy.svg.png.webp","url":"Mathematics_of_general_relativity"}
