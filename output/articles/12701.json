{"title":"Pseudo-determinant","summary":"In linear algebra and statistics, the pseudo-determinant[1] is the product of all non-zero eigenvalues of a square matrix. It coincides with the regular determinant when the matrix is non-singular.","image":"d7e50c50569c9e303856f40e5ab19f714d0fd4aa.svg","url":"Pseudo-determinant"}
