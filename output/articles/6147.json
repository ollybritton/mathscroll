{"title":"Geometric logic","summary":"In mathematical logic, geometric logic is an infinitary generalisation of coherent logic, a restriction of first-order logic due to Skolem that is proof-theoretically tractable. Geometric logic is capable of expressing many mathematical theories and has close connections to topos theory.","image":"909f55f8a7c33cd15e003a924ef9ef011944b8ab.svg","url":"Geometric_logic"}
