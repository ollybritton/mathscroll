{"title":"Case–control study","summary":"A case–control study (also known as case–referent study) is a type of observational study in which two existing groups differing in outcome are identified and compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute. Case–control studies are often used to identify factors that may contribute to a medical condition by comparing subjects who have that condition/disease (the \"cases\") with patients who do not have the condition/disease but are otherwise similar (the \"controls\").[1] They require fewer resources but provide less evidence for causal inference than a randomized controlled trial. A case–control study is often used to produce an odds ratio, which is an inferior measure of strength of association compared to relative risk, but new statistical methods make it possible to use a case-control study to estimate relative risk, risk differences, and other quantities.[2]","image":"ExplainingCaseControlSJW-en.svg.png.webp","url":"Case–control_study"}
