{"title":"Perpendicular","summary":"In elementary geometry, two geometric objects are perpendicular if their intersection forms right angles (angles that are 90 degrees or π/2 radians wide) at the point of intersection called a foot. The condition of perpendicularity may be represented graphically using the perpendicular symbol, ⟂. Perpendicular intersections can happen between two lines (or two line segments), between a line and a plane, and between two planes.","image":"Perpendicular-coloured.svg.png.webp","url":"Perpendicular"}
