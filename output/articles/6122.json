{"title":"Geodesic manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a complete manifold (or geodesically complete manifold) M is a (pseudo-) Riemannian manifold for which, starting at any point p, you can follow a \"straight\" line indefinitely along any direction. More formally, the exponential map at point p, is defined on TpM, the entire tangent space at p.","image":"1ddc8ddc67a9fcdf3b7373067bac47641a2729f9.svg","url":"Geodesic_manifold"}
