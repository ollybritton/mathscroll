{"title":"Equichordal point problem","summary":"In Euclidean plane geometry, the equichordal point problem is the question whether a closed planar convex body can have two equichordal points.[1] The problem was originally posed in 1916 by Fujiwara and in 1917 by Wilhelm Blaschke, Hermann Rothe, and Roland Weitzenb√∂ck.[2] A generalization of this problem statement was answered in the negative in 1997 by Marek R. Rychlik.[3]","image":"4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029.svg","url":"Equichordal_point_problem"}
