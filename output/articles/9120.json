{"title":"Lebesgue's decomposition theorem","summary":"In mathematics, more precisely in measure theory, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem[1][2][3] states that for every two σ-finite signed measures μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } and ν {\\displaystyle \\nu } on a measurable space ( Ω , Σ ) , {\\displaystyle (\\Omega ,\\Sigma ),} there exist two σ-finite signed measures ν 0 {\\displaystyle \\nu _{0}} and ν 1 {\\displaystyle \\nu _{1}} such that:","image":"9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161.svg","url":"Lebesgue's_decomposition_theorem"}
