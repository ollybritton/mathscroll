{"title":"Adams resolution","summary":"In mathematics, specifically algebraic topology, there is a resolution analogous to free resolutions of spectra yielding a tool for constructing the Adams spectral sequence. Essentially, the idea is to take a connective spectrum of finite type X {\\displaystyle X} and iteratively resolve with other spectra that are in the homotopy kernel of a map resolving the cohomology classes in H ∗ ( X ; Z / p ) {\\displaystyle H^{*}(X;\\mathbb {Z} /p)} using Eilenberg–MacLane spectra.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Adams_resolution"}
