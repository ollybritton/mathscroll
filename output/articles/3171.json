{"title":"Cone-shape distribution function","summary":"The cone-shape distribution function, also known as the Zhao–Atlas–Marks time-frequency distribution,[1]  (acronymized as the ZAM [2][3][4] distribution[5] or ZAMD[1]), is one of the members of Cohen's class distribution function.[1][6] It was first proposed by Yunxin Zhao, Les E. Atlas, and Robert J. Marks II in 1990.[7] The distribution's name stems from the twin cone shape of the distribution's kernel function on the t , τ {\\displaystyle t,\\tau } plane.[8] The advantage of the cone kernel function is that it can completely remove the cross-term between two components having the same center frequency. Cross-term results from components with the same time center, however, cannot be completely removed by the cone-shaped kernel.[9][10]","image":"a0f94ea30120d9531805b3480e934a82210c3b74.svg","url":"Cone-shape_distribution_function"}
