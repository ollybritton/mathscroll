{"title":"Sphericon","summary":"In solid geometry, the sphericon is a solid that has a continuous developable surface with two congruent, semi-circular edges, and four vertices that define a square. It is a member of a special family of rollers that, while being rolled on a flat surface, bring all the points of their surface to contact with the surface they are rolling on. It was discovered independently by carpenter Colin Roberts (who named it) in the UK in 1969,[1] by dancer and sculptor Alan Boeding of MOMIX in 1979,[2] and by inventor David Hirsch, who patented it in Israel in 1980.[3]","image":"Sphericon-ani.gif","url":"Sphericon"}
