{"title":"Transpose of a linear map","summary":"In linear algebra, the transpose of a linear map between two vector spaces, defined over the same field, is an induced map between the dual spaces of the two vector spaces. The transpose or algebraic adjoint of a linear map is often used to study the original linear map. This concept is generalised by adjoint functors.","image":"7197388bb622582f173a2c78284e849fde952f91.svg","url":"Transpose_of_a_linear_map"}
