{"title":"Symbolic method","summary":"In mathematics, the symbolic method in invariant theory is an algorithm developed by Arthur Cayley,[1] Siegfried Heinrich Aronhold,[2] Alfred Clebsch,[3] and Paul Gordan[4] in the 19th century for computing  invariants of algebraic forms. It is based on treating the form as if it were a power of a degree one form, which corresponds to embedding a symmetric power of a vector space into the symmetric elements of a tensor product of copies of it.","image":"ce9fa7dc6108f1ea251fc406678bacb845de1f63.svg","url":"Symbolic_method"}
