{"title":"Galerkin method","summary":"In mathematics, in the area of numerical analysis, Galerkin methods are named after the Soviet mathematician Boris Galerkin. They convert a continuous operator problem, such as a differential equation, commonly in a weak formulation, to a discrete problem by applying linear constraints determined by finite sets of basis functions.","image":"45d894430af69e29d6dda5aacbf4bb19336226a0.svg","url":"Galerkin_method"}
