{"title":"Symmetric algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the symmetric algebra S(V) (also denoted Sym(V)) on a vector space V over a field K is a commutative algebra over K that contains V, and is, in some sense, minimal for this property. Here, \"minimal\" means that S(V) satisfies the following universal property: for every linear map f from V to a commutative algebra A, there is a unique algebra homomorphism g : S(V) → A such that f = g ∘ i, where i is the inclusion map of V in S(V).","image":"e16212a67bd7e71b91b886db1672c88533277188.svg","url":"Symmetric_algebra"}
