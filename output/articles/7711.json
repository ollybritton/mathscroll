{"title":"Indefinite sum","summary":"In discrete calculus the indefinite sum operator (also known as the antidifference operator), denoted by ∑ x {\\textstyle \\sum _{x}} or Δ − 1 {\\displaystyle \\Delta ^{-1}} ,[1][2] is the linear operator, inverse of the forward difference operator Δ {\\displaystyle \\Delta } . It relates to the forward difference operator as the indefinite integral relates to the derivative. Thus","image":"b0f1548474c17e6c7f41f391b7337e79bdff24ba.svg","url":"Indefinite_sum"}
