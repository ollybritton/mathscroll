{"title":"History of the function concept","summary":"The mathematical concept of a function emerged in the 17th century in connection with the development of the calculus; for example, the slope d y / d x {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {d} \\!y/\\operatorname {d} \\!x} of a graph at a point was regarded as a function of the x-coordinate of the point. Functions were not explicitly considered in antiquity, but some precursors of the concept can perhaps be seen in the work of medieval philosophers and mathematicians such as Oresme.","image":"a2aabdbf5b0c9c6594e6aa0daf368812209d67fc.svg","url":"History_of_the_function_concept"}
