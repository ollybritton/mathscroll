{"title":"Swinging Atwood's machine","summary":"The swinging Atwood's machine (SAM) is a mechanism that resembles a simple Atwood's machine except that one of the masses is allowed to swing in a two-dimensional plane, producing a dynamical system that is chaotic for some system parameters and initial conditions.","image":"Swinging_Atwoods_Machine.svg.png.webp","url":"Swinging_Atwood's_machine"}
