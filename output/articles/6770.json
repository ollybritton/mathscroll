{"title":"Haar wavelet","summary":"In mathematics, the Haar wavelet is a sequence of rescaled \"square-shaped\" functions which together form a wavelet family or basis. Wavelet analysis is similar to Fourier analysis in that it allows a target function over an interval to be represented in terms of an orthonormal basis. The Haar sequence is now recognised as the first known wavelet basis and is extensively used as a teaching example.","image":"Haar_wavelet.svg.png.webp","url":"Haar_wavelet"}
