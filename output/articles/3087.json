{"title":"Compound of twenty octahedra with rotational freedom","summary":"The compound of twenty octahedra with rotational freedom is a uniform polyhedron compound. It's composed of a symmetric arrangement of 20 octahedra, considered as triangular antiprisms. It can be constructed by superimposing two copies of the compound of 10 octahedra UC16, and for each resulting pair of octahedra, rotating each octahedron in the pair by an equal and opposite angle Î¸.","image":"UC13-20_octahedra.png.webp","url":"Compound_of_twenty_octahedra_with_rotational_freedom"}
