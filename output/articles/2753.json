{"title":"Clifford module","summary":"In mathematics, a Clifford module is a representation of a Clifford algebra. In general a Clifford algebra C is a central simple algebra over some field extension L of the field K over which the quadratic form Q defining C is defined.","image":"1bf306a482d822ed31e413e775019b24c4e013bf.svg","url":"Clifford_module"}
