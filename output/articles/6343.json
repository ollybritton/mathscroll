{"title":"God's algorithm","summary":"God's algorithm is a notion originating in discussions of ways to solve the Rubik's Cube puzzle,[1] but which can also be applied to other combinatorial puzzles and mathematical games.[2] It refers to any algorithm which produces a solution having the fewest possible moves. The allusion to the Deity is based on an assumption that only an omniscient being would know an optimal step from any given configuration.","image":"51e4bd4ef2f9549d026cbf643a91c0d12a8c6794.svg","url":"God's_algorithm"}
