{"title":"Transformation geometry","summary":"In mathematics, transformation geometry (or transformational geometry) is the name of a mathematical and pedagogic take on the study of geometry by focusing on groups of geometric transformations, and properties that are invariant under them.  It is opposed to the classical synthetic geometry approach of Euclidean geometry, that focuses on proving theorems.","image":"Simx2%3Dtransl_OK.svg.png.webp","url":"Transformation_geometry"}
