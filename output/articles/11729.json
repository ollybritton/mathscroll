{"title":"Pairwise error probability","summary":"Pairwise error probability is the error probability that for a transmitted signal ( X {\\displaystyle X} ) its corresponding but distorted version ( X ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {X}}} ) will be received. This type of probability is called ″pair-wise error probability″ because the probability exists with a pair of signal vectors in a signal constellation.[1] It's mainly used in communication systems.[1]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Pairwise_error_probability"}
