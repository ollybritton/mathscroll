{"title":"Betrothed numbers","summary":"Betrothed numbers or quasi-amicable numbers are two positive integers such that the sum of the proper divisors of either number is one more than the value of the other number. In other words, (m, n) are a pair of betrothed numbers if s(m) = n + 1  and s(n) = m + 1, where s(n) is the aliquot sum of n: an equivalent condition is that σ(m) = σ(n) = m + n + 1, where σ denotes the sum-of-divisors function.","image":"Lattice_of_the_divisibility_of_60.svg.png.webp","url":"Betrothed_numbers"}
