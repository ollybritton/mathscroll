{"title":"Thin set (Serre)","summary":"In mathematics, a thin set in the sense of Serre, named after Jean-Pierre Serre, is a certain kind of subset constructed in algebraic geometry over a given field K, by allowed operations that are in a definite sense 'unlikely'. The two fundamental ones are: solving a polynomial equation that may or may not be the case; solving within K a polynomial that does not always factorise. One is also allowed to take finite unions.","image":"96c30bc270be3257f05d6fc7e7d3983cebf133a7.svg","url":"Thin_set_(Serre)"}
