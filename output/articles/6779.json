{"title":"Hadamard product (matrices)","summary":"In mathematics, the Hadamard product (also known as the element-wise product, entrywise product[1]: ch. 5  or Schur product[2]) is a binary operation that takes two matrices of the same dimensions and produces another matrix of the same dimension as the operands, where each element i, j is the product of elements i, j of the original two matrices. It is to be distinguished from the more common matrix product. It is attributed to, and named after, either French mathematician Jacques Hadamard or German Russian mathematician Issai Schur.","image":"Hadamard_product_qtl1.svg.png.webp","url":"Hadamard_product_(matrices)"}
