{"title":"Formal methods","summary":"In computer science, formal methods are mathematically rigorous techniques for the specification, development, analysis, and verification of software and hardware systems.[1] The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.[2]","image":"Computer_Retro.svg.png.webp","url":"Formal_methods"}
