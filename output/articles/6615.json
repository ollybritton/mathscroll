{"title":"Groundwater flow equation","summary":"Used in hydrogeology, the groundwater flow equation is the mathematical relationship which is used to describe the flow of groundwater through an aquifer. The transient flow of groundwater is described by a form of the diffusion equation, similar to that used in heat transfer to describe the flow of heat in a solid (heat conduction). The steady-state flow of groundwater is described by a form of the Laplace equation, which is a form of potential flow and has analogs in numerous fields.","image":"a0b79232e61120a341deff90e5791b673102b095.svg","url":"Groundwater_flow_equation"}
