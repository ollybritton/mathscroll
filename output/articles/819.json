{"title":"Angle bisector theorem","summary":"In geometry, the angle bisector theorem is concerned with the relative lengths of the two segments that a triangle's side is divided into by a line that bisects the opposite angle. It equates their relative lengths to the relative lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.","image":"Triangle_ABC_with_bisector_AD.svg.png.webp","url":"Angle_bisector_theorem"}
