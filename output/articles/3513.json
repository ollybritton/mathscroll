{"title":"Covering group","summary":"In mathematics, a covering group of a topological group H is a covering space G of H such that G is a topological group and the covering map p : G → H is a continuous group homomorphism. The map p is called the covering homomorphism. A frequently occurring case is a double covering group, a topological double cover in which H has index 2 in G; examples include the spin groups, pin groups, and metaplectic groups.","image":"ab2d7d00eda540963c7a551a209ef369b2eaa60a.svg","url":"Covering_group"}
