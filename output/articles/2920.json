{"title":"Commutative magma","summary":"In mathematics, there exist magmas that are commutative but not associative. A simple example of such a magma may be derived from the children's game of rock, paper, scissors. Such magmas give rise to non-associative algebras.","image":"e28b0e46747a59eafc39c35c25b20f601de5e145.svg","url":"Commutative_magma"}
