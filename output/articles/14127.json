{"title":"Semilinear map","summary":"In linear algebra, particularly projective geometry, a semilinear map between vector spaces V and W over a field K is a function that is a linear map \"up to a twist\", hence semi-linear, where \"twist\" means \"field automorphism of K\". Explicitly, it is a function T : V → W that is:","image":"489e0f630c98869b9e233e13deb1b726d6269271.svg","url":"Semilinear_map"}
