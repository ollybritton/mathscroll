{"title":"Topological modular forms","summary":"In mathematics, topological modular forms (tmf) is the name of a spectrum that describes a generalized cohomology theory. In concrete terms, for any integer n there is a topological space tmf n {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {tmf} ^{n}} , and these spaces are equipped with certain maps between them, so that for any topological space X, one obtains an abelian group structure on the set tmf n ‚Å° ( X ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {tmf} ^{n}(X)} of homotopy classes of continuous maps from X to tmf n {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {tmf} ^{n}} .  One feature that distinguishes tmf is the fact that its coefficient ring, tmf 0 {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {tmf} ^{0}} (point), is almost the same as the graded ring of holomorphic modular forms with integral cusp expansions. Indeed, these two rings become isomorphic after inverting the primes 2 and 3, but this inversion erases a lot of torsion information in the coefficient ring.","image":"3f56a4263c7d1a4e8a985c5dacf0cf7b4869ca22.svg","url":"Topological_modular_forms"}
