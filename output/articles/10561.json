{"title":"Mizar system","summary":"The Mizar system consists of a formal language for writing mathematical definitions and proofs, a proof assistant, which is able to mechanically check proofs written in this language, and a library of formalized mathematics, which can be used in the proof of new theorems.[1] The system is maintained and developed by the Mizar Project, formerly under the direction of its founder Andrzej Trybulec.","image":"Mizar_system_logo.gif","url":"Mizar_system"}
