{"title":"Conformal symmetry","summary":"In mathematical physics, the conformal symmetry of spacetime is expressed by an extension of the Poincaré group, known as the conformal group. The extension includes special conformal transformations and dilations. In three spatial plus one time dimensions, conformal symmetry has 15 degrees of freedom: ten for the Poincaré group, four for special conformal transformations, and one for a dilation.","image":"eb78a84953b5dfce6f4a49b73f1a0859d75c4137.svg","url":"Conformal_symmetry"}
