{"title":"Nevanlinna invariant","summary":"In mathematics, the Nevanlinna invariant of an ample divisor D on a normal projective variety X is a real number connected with the rate of growth of the number of rational points on the variety with respect to the embedding defined by the divisor.  The concept is named after Rolf Nevanlinna.","image":"4acc7192edf66bf450c9e0fb4d0274dd89e3a995.svg","url":"Nevanlinna_invariant"}
