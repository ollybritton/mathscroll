{"title":"Bilevel optimization","summary":"Bilevel optimization is a special kind of optimization where one problem is embedded (nested) within another. The outer optimization task is commonly referred to as the upper-level optimization task, and the inner optimization task is commonly referred to as the lower-level optimization task. These problems involve two kinds of variables, referred to as the upper-level variables and the lower-level variables.[1][2][3]","image":"428861b5027b91a76257b85141a1522deb2a9401.svg","url":"Bilevel_optimization"}
