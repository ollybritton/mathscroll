{"title":"Slice genus","summary":"In mathematics, the slice genus of a smooth knot K in S3 (sometimes called its Murasugi genus or 4-ball genus) is the least integer g such that K is the boundary of a connected, orientable 2-manifold S of genus g properly embedded in the 4-ball D4 bounded by S3.","image":"c20329add37b6485a573b988a2cf3f15708d1205.svg","url":"Slice_genus"}
