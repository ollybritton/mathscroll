{"title":"Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm","summary":"In numerical linear algebra, the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm is an iterative method for the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix (a process known as diagonalization). It is named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, who first proposed the method in 1846,[1] but only became widely used in the 1950s with the advent of computers.[2]","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Jacobi_eigenvalue_algorithm"}
