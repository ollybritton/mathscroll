{"title":"Hanner's inequalities","summary":"In mathematics, Hanner's inequalities are results in the theory of Lp spaces. Their proof was published in 1956 by Olof Hanner. They provide a simpler way of proving the uniform convexity of Lp spaces for p ∈ (1, +∞) than the approach proposed by James A. Clarkson in 1936.","image":"8eb7e5dfb79f74bff4672fa288de67b94a05f679.svg","url":"Hanner's_inequalities"}
