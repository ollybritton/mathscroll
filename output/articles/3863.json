{"title":"Decomposition of a module","summary":"In abstract algebra, a decomposition of a module is a way to write a module as a direct sum of modules. A type of a decomposition is often used to define or characterize modules: for example, a semisimple module is a module that has a decomposition into simple modules. Given a ring, the types of decomposition of modules over the ring can also be used to define or characterize the ring: a ring is semisimple if and only if every module over it is a semisimple module.","image":"2c7f04ce3d71b384852009d11b265f0a262e61c2.svg","url":"Decomposition_of_a_module"}
