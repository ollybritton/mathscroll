{"title":"Wheel graph","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, a wheel graph is a graph formed by connecting a single universal vertex to all vertices of a cycle. A wheel graph with n vertices can also be defined as the 1-skeleton of an (n – 1)-gonal pyramid. Some authors[1] write Wn to denote a wheel graph with n vertices (n ≥ 4); other authors[2] instead use Wn to denote a wheel graph with n + 1 vertices (n ≥ 3), which is formed by connecting a single vertex to all vertices of a cycle of length n. The rest of this article uses the former notation.","image":"Wheel_graphs.svg.png.webp","url":"Wheel_graph"}
