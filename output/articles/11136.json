{"title":"Nome (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, specifically the theory of elliptic functions, the nome is a special function that belongs to the non-elementary functions. This function is of great importance in the description of the elliptic functions, especially in the description of the modular identity of the Jacobi theta function, the Hermite elliptic transcendents and the Weber modular functions, that are used for solving equations of higher degrees.","image":"015dd573afecc33ca6033395f33384175039d113.svg","url":"Nome_(mathematics)"}
