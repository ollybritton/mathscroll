{"title":"Constructible sheaf","summary":"In mathematics, a constructible sheaf is a sheaf of abelian groups over some topological space X, such that X is the union of a finite number of locally closed subsets on each of which the sheaf is a locally constant sheaf. It has its origins in algebraic geometry, where in étale cohomology constructible sheaves are defined in a similar way (Artin, Grothendieck & Verdier 1972, Exposé IX § 2). For the derived category of constructible sheaves, see a section in ℓ-adic sheaf.","image":"205d4b91000d9dcf1a5bbabdfa6a8395fa60b676.svg","url":"Constructible_sheaf"}
