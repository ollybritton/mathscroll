{"title":"Arnold tongue","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in dynamical systems, Arnold tongues (named after Vladimir Arnold)[1][2] are a pictorial phenomenon that occur when visualizing how the rotation number of a dynamical system, or other related invariant property thereof, changes according to two or more of its parameters. The regions of constant rotation number have been observed, for some dynamical systems, to form geometric shapes that resemble tongues, in which case they are called Arnold tongues.[3]","image":"Circle_map_winding_number.jpeg.webp","url":"Arnold_tongue"}
