{"title":"Minimum bottleneck spanning tree","summary":"In mathematics, a minimum bottleneck spanning tree (MBST) in an undirected graph is a spanning tree in which the most expensive edge is as cheap as possible. A bottleneck edge is the highest weighted edge in a spanning tree. A spanning tree is a minimum bottleneck spanning tree if the graph does not contain a spanning tree with a smaller bottleneck edge weight.[1] For a directed graph, a similar problem is known as Minimum Bottleneck Spanning Arborescence (MBSA).","image":"MBST.png.webp","url":"Minimum_bottleneck_spanning_tree"}
