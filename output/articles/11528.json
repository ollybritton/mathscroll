{"title":"Order isomorphism","summary":"In the mathematical field of order theory, an order isomorphism is a special kind of monotone function that constitutes a suitable notion of isomorphism for partially ordered sets (posets). Whenever two posets are order isomorphic, they can be considered to be \"essentially the same\" in the sense that either of the orders can be obtained from the other just by renaming of elements. Two strictly weaker notions that relate to order isomorphisms are order embeddings and Galois connections.[1]","image":"cdc468186be3297439477301db90b246c586b234.svg","url":"Order_isomorphism"}
