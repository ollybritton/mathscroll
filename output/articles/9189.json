{"title":"Lemon (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a lemon is a geometric shape, constructed as the surface of revolution of a circular arc of angle less than half of a full circle, rotated about an axis passing through the endpoints of the lens (or arc). The surface of revolution of the complementary arc of the same circle, through the same axis, is called an apple.","image":"Standard_torus-spindle.png.webp","url":"Lemon_(geometry)"}
