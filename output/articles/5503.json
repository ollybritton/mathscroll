{"title":"Five points determine a conic","summary":"In Euclidean and projective geometry, five points determine a conic (a degree-2 plane curve), just as two (distinct) points determine a line (a degree-1 plane curve). There are additional subtleties for conics that do not exist for lines, and thus the statement and its proof for conics are both more technical than for lines.","image":"27723c27f10ff7f87ef69173f6e9134f75a55245.svg","url":"Five_points_determine_a_conic"}
