{"title":"Bundle of principal parts","summary":"In algebraic geometry, given a line bundle L on a smooth variety X, the bundle of n-th order principal parts of L is a vector bundle of rank ( n + dim ( X ) n ) {\\displaystyle {\\tbinom {n+{\\text{dim}}(X)}{n}}} that, roughly, parametrizes n-th order Taylor expansions of sections ofÂ L.","image":"375947638f5a8d53080c13711ffec6b6d9bc4e7f.svg","url":"Bundle_of_principal_parts"}
