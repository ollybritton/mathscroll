{"title":"Metabiaugmented hexagonal prism","summary":"In geometry, the metabiaugmented hexagonal prism is one of the Johnson solids (J56). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by doubly augmenting a hexagonal prism by attaching square pyramids (J1) to two of its nonadjacent, nonparallel equatorial faces. Attaching the pyramids to opposite equatorial faces yields a parabiaugmented hexagonal prism. (The solid obtained by attaching pyramids to adjacent equatorial faces is not convex, and thus not a Johnson solid.)","image":"Metabiaugmented_hexagonal_prism.png.webp","url":"Metabiaugmented_hexagonal_prism"}
