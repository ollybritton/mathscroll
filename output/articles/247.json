{"title":"Abelian and Tauberian theorems","summary":"In mathematics, Abelian and Tauberian theorems are theorems giving conditions for two methods of summing divergent series to give the same result, named after Niels Henrik Abel and Alfred Tauber. The original examples are Abel's theorem showing that if a series converges to some limit then its Abel sum is the same limit, and Tauber's theorem showing that if the Abel sum of a series exists and the coefficients are sufficiently small (o(1/n)) then the series converges to the Abel sum. More general Abelian and Tauberian theorems give similar results for more general summation methods.","image":"86311463b1fd37b49690e8ef2a353b3301b110b0.svg","url":"Abelian_and_Tauberian_theorems"}
