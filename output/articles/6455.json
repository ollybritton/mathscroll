{"title":"Graph amalgamation","summary":"In graph theory, a graph amalgamation is a relationship between two graphs (one graph is an amalgamation of another).  Similar relationships include subgraphs and minors. Amalgamations can provide a way to reduce a graph to a simpler graph while keeping certain structure intact. The amalgamation can then be used to study properties of the original graph in an easier to understand context. Applications include embeddings,[1] computing  genus distribution,[2] and Hamiltonian decompositions.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Graph_amalgamation"}
