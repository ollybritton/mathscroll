{"title":"Trihexagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the trihexagonal tiling is one of 11 uniform tilings of the Euclidean plane by regular polygons.[1] It consists of equilateral triangles and regular hexagons, arranged so that each hexagon is surrounded by triangles and vice versa. The name derives from the fact that it combines a regular hexagonal tiling and a regular triangular tiling. Two hexagons and two triangles alternate around each vertex, and its edges form an infinite arrangement of lines. Its dual is the rhombille tiling.[2]","image":"Tiling_3-6_simple.svg.png.webp","url":"Trihexagonal_tiling"}
