{"title":"Pure submodule","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the field of module theory, the concept of pure submodule provides a generalization of direct summand, a type of particularly well-behaved piece of a module.  Pure modules are complementary to flat modules and generalize Pr√ºfer's notion of pure subgroups.  While flat modules are those modules which leave short exact sequences exact after tensoring, a pure submodule defines a short exact sequence (known as a pure exact sequence) that remains exact after tensoring with any module.  Similarly a flat module is a direct limit of projective modules, and a pure exact sequence is a direct limit of split exact sequences.","image":"75fc199c75c6ade68719489e4ddb268bbaba85d5.svg","url":"Pure_submodule"}
