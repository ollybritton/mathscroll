{"title":"Laplacian matrix","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Laplacian matrix, also called the graph Laplacian, admittance matrix, Kirchhoff matrix or discrete Laplacian, is a matrix representation of a graph. Named after Pierre-Simon Laplace, the graph Laplacian matrix can be viewed as a matrix form of the negative discrete Laplace operator on a graph approximating the negative continuous Laplacian obtained by the finite difference method.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Laplacian_matrix"}
