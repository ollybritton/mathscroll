{"title":"Borwein integral","summary":"In mathematics, a Borwein integral is an integral whose unusual properties were first presented by mathematicians David Borwein and Jonathan Borwein in 2001.[1] Borwein integrals involve products of sinc ⁡ ( a x ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {sinc} (ax)} , where the sinc function is given by sinc ⁡ ( x ) = sin ⁡ ( x ) / x {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {sinc} (x)=\\sin(x)/x} for x {\\displaystyle x} not equal to 0, and sinc ⁡ ( 0 ) = 1 {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {sinc} (0)=1} .[1][2]","image":"4639a3768bfd4e817788530477a2fcad68bb83ef.svg","url":"Borwein_integral"}
