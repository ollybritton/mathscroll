{"title":"Derived scheme","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a derived scheme is a pair ( X , O ) {\\displaystyle (X,{\\mathcal {O}})} consisting of a topological space X and a sheaf O {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}} either of simplicial commutative rings or of commutative ring spectra[1] on X such that (1) the pair ( X , π 0 O ) {\\displaystyle (X,\\pi _{0}{\\mathcal {O}})} is a scheme and (2) π k O {\\displaystyle \\pi _{k}{\\mathcal {O}}} is a quasi-coherent π 0 O {\\displaystyle \\pi _{0}{\\mathcal {O}}} -module. The notion gives a homotopy-theoretic generalization of a scheme.","image":"922442a5575888b509d846450a3fcf1ae09c2f8d.svg","url":"Derived_scheme"}
