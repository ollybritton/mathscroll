{"title":"Idempotency of entailment","summary":"Idempotency of entailment is a property of logical systems that states that one may derive the same consequences from many instances of a hypothesis as from just one.   This property can be captured by a structural rule called contraction, and in such systems one may say that entailment is idempotent if and only if contraction is an admissible rule.","image":"8137c0749a33ed82aad0c7fc97574f3d9ef3e307.svg","url":"Idempotency_of_entailment"}
