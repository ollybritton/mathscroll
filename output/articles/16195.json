{"title":"Truncation (statistics)","summary":"In statistics, truncation results in values that are limited above or below, resulting in a truncated sample.[1] A random variable y {\\displaystyle y} is said to be truncated from below if, for some threshold value c {\\displaystyle c} , the exact value of y {\\displaystyle y} is known for all cases y > c {\\displaystyle y>c} , but unknown for all cases y ≤ c {\\displaystyle y\\leq c} . Similarly, truncation from above means the exact value of y {\\displaystyle y} is known in cases where y < c {\\displaystyle y<c} , but unknown when y ≥ c {\\displaystyle y\\geq c} .[2]","image":"b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d.svg","url":"Truncation_(statistics)"}
