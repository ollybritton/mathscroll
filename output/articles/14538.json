{"title":"Small control property","summary":"For applied mathematics, in nonlinear control theory, a non-linear system of the form x ˙ = f ( x , u ) {\\displaystyle {\\dot {x}}=f(x,u)} is said to satisfy the small control property if for every ε > 0 {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon >0} there exists a δ > 0 {\\displaystyle \\delta >0} so that for all ‖ x ‖ < δ {\\displaystyle \\|x\\|<\\delta } there exists a ‖ u ‖ < ε {\\displaystyle \\|u\\|<\\varepsilon } so that the time derivative of the system's Lyapunov function is negative definite at that point.","image":"1334f227078346e61d77a3388035f55f75c8e000.svg","url":"Small_control_property"}
