{"title":"Essential range","summary":"In mathematics, particularly measure theory, the essential range, or the set of essential values, of a function is intuitively the 'non-negligible' range of the function: It does not change between two functions that are equal almost everywhere. One way of thinking of the essential range of a function is the set on which the range of the function is 'concentrated'.","image":"93c2231ecc1de29bbf69188c03ffa89dd217f085.svg","url":"Essential_range"}
