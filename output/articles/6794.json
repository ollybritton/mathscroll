{"title":"Hagoromo Bungu","summary":"Hagoromo Bungu (Japanese: 羽衣文具, lit. 'Hagoromo Stationery') was a Japanese office supply and chalk company. It is best known for having produced the Hagoromo Fulltouch Chalk, a brand of blackboard chalk.[1][2][3] Though mainly sold in Japan and South Korea, the chalk came to be used worldwide for its alleged ease of use. Nonetheless, general decline in chalk sales among other factors led to its shuttering in 2015. The announcement of the company's closing led fans to stockpile its chalk. South Korean company Sejongmall eventually bought the Hagoromo brand and much of the original company's equipment and has manufactured the chalk in South Korea since 2016.[4][5]","image":"Hagoromo_Stationery_Head_office_and_Factory-20141210.jpg.webp","url":"Hagoromo_Bungu"}
