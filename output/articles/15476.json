{"title":"Tamagawa number","summary":"In mathematics, the Tamagawa number τ ( G ) {\\displaystyle \\tau (G)} of a semisimple algebraic group defined over a global field k is the measure of G ( A ) / G ( k ) {\\displaystyle G(\\mathbb {A} )/G(k)} , where A {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {A} } is the adele ring of k. Tamagawa numbers were introduced by Tamagawa (1966), and named after him by Weil (1959).","image":"a59413d463ac9812a45c84675be86376f374320e.svg","url":"Tamagawa_number"}
