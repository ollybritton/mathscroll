{"title":"Osgood curve","summary":"In mathematical analysis, an Osgood curve is a non-self-intersecting curve that has positive area. Despite its area, it is not possible for such a curve to cover a convex set, distinguishing them from space-filling curves. Osgood curves are named after William Fogg Osgood.","image":"Osgood_curve.svg.png.webp","url":"Osgood_curve"}
