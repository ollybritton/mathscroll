{"title":"Quasitrace","summary":"In mathematics, especially functional analysis, a quasitrace is a not necessarily additive tracial functional on a C*-algebra. An additive quasitrace is called a trace. It is a major open problem if every quasitrace is a trace.","image":"b91b7dc0a05241d05a4f78611e293b852fb0327a.svg","url":"Quasitrace"}
