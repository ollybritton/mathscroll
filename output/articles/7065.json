{"title":"Henstock–Kurzweil integral","summary":"In mathematics, the Henstock–Kurzweil integral or generalized Riemann integral or gauge integral – also known as the (narrow) Denjoy integral (pronounced [dɑ̃ˈʒwa]), Luzin integral or Perron integral, but not to be confused with the more general wide Denjoy integral – is one of a number of inequivalent definitions of the integral of a function. It is a generalization of the Riemann integral, and in some situations is more general than the Lebesgue integral.  In particular, a function is Lebesgue integrable if and only if the function and its absolute value are Henstock–Kurzweil integrable.","image":"c2343466546fadfbb6ec1fb3cfa67dea5794bfa7.svg","url":"Henstock–Kurzweil_integral"}
