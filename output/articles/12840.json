{"title":"Quadrisecant","summary":"In geometry, a quadrisecant or quadrisecant line of a space curve is a line that passes through four points of the curve. This is the largest possible number of intersections that a generic space curve can have with a line, and for such curves the quadrisecants form a discrete set of lines. Quadrisecants have been studied for curves of several types:","image":"Trefoil_quadrisecants.png.webp","url":"Quadrisecant"}
