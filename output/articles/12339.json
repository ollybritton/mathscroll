{"title":"Polynomial decomposition","summary":"In mathematics, a polynomial decomposition expresses a polynomial f as the functional composition g âˆ˜ h {\\displaystyle g\\circ h} of polynomials g and h, where g and h have degree greater than 1; it is an algebraic functional decomposition. Algorithms are known for decomposing univariate polynomials in polynomial time.","image":"43cf6b5a87c95b7592be480ed4ef3324aea3bec9.svg","url":"Polynomial_decomposition"}
