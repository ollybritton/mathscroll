{"title":"Weierstrass M-test","summary":"In mathematics, the Weierstrass M-test is a test for determining whether an infinite series of functions converges uniformly and absolutely. It applies to series whose terms are bounded functions with real or complex values, and is analogous to the comparison test for determining the convergence of series of real or complex numbers. It is named after the German mathematician Karl Weierstrass (1815-1897).","image":"4ae2a3aaedd211bcf943dcbe4a0940b45254eec0.svg","url":"Weierstrass_M-test"}
