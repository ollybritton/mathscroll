{"title":"Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture","summary":"The Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture was a conjecture (now a theorem) in mathematics, specifically, the  Diophantine approximation proposed by R. J. Duffin and A. C. Schaeffer in 1941.[1] It states that if f : N → R + {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb {R} ^{+}} is a real-valued function taking on positive values, then for almost all α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } (with respect to Lebesgue measure), the inequality","image":"f846e3fc3608f87b700df25acd3d7be36e51fb39.svg","url":"Duffin–Schaeffer_conjecture"}
