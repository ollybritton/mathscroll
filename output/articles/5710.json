{"title":"Free boundary problem","summary":"In mathematics, a free boundary problem (FB problem) is a partial differential equation to be solved for both an unknown function u {\\displaystyle u} and an unknown domain Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } . The segment Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } of the boundary of Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } which is not known at the outset of the problem is the free boundary.","image":"c3e6bb763d22c20916ed4f0bb6bd49d7470cffd8.svg","url":"Free_boundary_problem"}
