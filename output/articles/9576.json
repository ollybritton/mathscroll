{"title":"Lists of uniform tilings on the sphere, plane, and hyperbolic plane","summary":"In geometry, many uniform tilings on sphere, euclidean plane, and hyperbolic plane can be made by Wythoff construction within a fundamental triangle, (p q r), defined by internal angles as π/p, π/q, and π/r. Special cases are right triangles (p q 2). Uniform solutions are constructed by a single generator point with 7 positions within the fundamental triangle, the 3 corners, along the 3 edges, and the triangle interior. All vertices exist at the generator, or a reflected copy of it. Edges exist between a generator point and its image across a mirror. Up to 3 face types exist centered on the fundamental triangle corners. Right triangle domains can have as few as 1 face type, making regular forms, while general triangles have at least 2 triangle types, leading at best to a quasiregular tiling.","image":"04bd013a2bae7bf9b04fbf84a70479a2af3bf278.svg","url":"Lists_of_uniform_tilings_on_the_sphere,_plane,_and_hyperbolic_plane"}
