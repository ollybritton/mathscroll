{"title":"Isogonal figure","summary":"In geometry, a polytope (e.g. a polygon or polyhedron) or a tiling  is isogonal or vertex-transitive if all its vertices are equivalent under the symmetries of the figure. This implies that each vertex is surrounded by the same kinds of face in the same or reverse order, and with the same angles between corresponding faces.","image":"Uniform_apeirogon.png.webp","url":"Isogonal_figure"}
