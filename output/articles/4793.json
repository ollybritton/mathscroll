{"title":"Elongated triangular orthobicupola","summary":"In geometry, the elongated triangular orthobicupola or cantellated triangular prism is one of the Johnson solids  (J35). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a triangular orthobicupola (J27) by inserting a hexagonal prism between its two halves. The resulting solid is superficially similar to the rhombicuboctahedron (one of the Archimedean solids), with the difference that it has threefold rotational symmetry about its axis instead of fourfold symmetry.","image":"Elongated_triangular_orthobicupola.png.webp","url":"Elongated_triangular_orthobicupola"}
