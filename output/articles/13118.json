{"title":"Rank of an abelian group","summary":"In mathematics, the rank, Pr√ºfer rank, or torsion-free rank of an abelian group A is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset.[1] The rank of A determines the size of the largest free abelian group contained in A. If A is torsion-free then it embeds into a vector space over the rational numbers of dimension rank A. For finitely generated abelian groups, rank is a strong invariant and every such group is determined up to isomorphism by its rank and torsion subgroup. Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 have been completely classified. However, the theory of abelian groups of higher rank is more involved.","image":"18ce3063f9e586ad4a55fdd932b2c535b9203f5a.svg","url":"Rank_of_an_abelian_group"}
