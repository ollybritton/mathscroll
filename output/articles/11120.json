{"title":"Niven's constant","summary":"In number theory, Niven's constant, named after Ivan Niven, is the largest exponent appearing in the prime factorization of any natural number n \"on average\". More precisely, if we define H(1) = 1 and H(n) = the largest exponent appearing in the unique prime factorization of a natural number n > 1, then Niven's constant is given by","image":"9fe5d8c2329f66b2814b8950768a4824de31e1d5.svg","url":"Niven's_constant"}
