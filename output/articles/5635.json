{"title":"Fractal string","summary":"An ordinary fractal string Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } is a bounded, open subset of the real number line. Such a subset can be written as an at-most-countable union of connected open intervals with associated lengths L = { ℓ 1 , ℓ 2 , … } {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}=\\{\\ell _{1},\\ell _{2},\\ldots \\}} written in non-increasing order; we also refer to L {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}} as a fractal string. For example, L = { 1 3 , 1 9 , 1 9 , … } {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}=\\left\\{{\\frac {1}{3}},{\\frac {1}{9}},{\\frac {1}{9}},\\ldots \\right\\}} is a fractal string corresponding to the Cantor set. A fractal string is the analogue of a one-dimensional \"fractal drum,\" and typically the set Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } has a boundary ∂ Ω {\\displaystyle \\partial \\Omega } which corresponds to a fractal such as the Cantor set. The heuristic idea of a fractal string is to study a (one-dimensional) fractal using the \"space around the fractal.\" It turns out that the sequence of lengths L {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}} of the set itself is \"intrinsic,\" in the sense that the fractal string L {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}} itself (independent of a specific geometric realization of these lengths as corresponding to a choice of set Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } ) contains information about the fractal to which it corresponds.[1]","image":"24b0d5ca6f381068d756f6337c08e0af9d1eeb6f.svg","url":"Fractal_string"}
