{"title":"Carnot group","summary":"In mathematics, a Carnot group is a simply connected nilpotent Lie group, together with a derivation of its Lie algebra such that the subspace with eigenvalue 1 generates the Lie algebra. The subbundle of the tangent bundle associated to this eigenspace is called horizontal. On a Carnot group, any norm on the horizontal subbundle gives rise to a Carnot–Carathéodory metric. Carnot–Carathéodory metrics have metric dilations; they are asymptotic cones (see Ultralimit) of finitely-generated nilpotent groups, and of nilpotent Lie groups, as well as tangent cones of sub-Riemannian manifolds.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Carnot_group"}
