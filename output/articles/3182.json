{"title":"Configuration space (physics)","summary":"In classical mechanics, the parameters that define the configuration of a system are called generalized coordinates, and the space defined by these coordinates is called the configuration space of the physical system.  It is often the case that these parameters satisfy mathematical constraints, such that the set of actual configurations of the system is a manifold in the space of generalized coordinates.  This manifold is called the configuration manifold of the system. Notice that this is a notion of \"unrestricted\" configuration space, i.e. in which different point particles may occupy the same position. In mathematics, in particular in topology, a notion of \"restricted\" configuration space is mostly used, in which the diagonals, representing \"colliding\" particles, are removed.","image":"f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7.svg","url":"Configuration_space_(physics)"}
