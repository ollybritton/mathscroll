{"title":"Disjunction elimination","summary":"In propositional logic, disjunction elimination[1][2] (sometimes named proof by cases, case analysis, or or elimination), is the valid argument form and rule of inference that allows one to eliminate a disjunctive statement from a logical proof. It is the inference that  if a statement P {\\displaystyle P} implies a statement Q {\\displaystyle Q} and a statement R {\\displaystyle R} also implies Q {\\displaystyle Q} , then if either P {\\displaystyle P} or R {\\displaystyle R} is true, then Q {\\displaystyle Q} has to be true. The reasoning is simple: since at least one of the statements P and R is true, and since either of them would be sufficient to entail Q, Q is certainly true.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Disjunction_elimination"}
