{"title":"Cotangent complex","summary":"In mathematics, the cotangent complex is a common generalisation of the cotangent sheaf, normal bundle and virtual tangent bundle of a map of geometric spaces such as manifolds or schemes. If f : X → Y {\\displaystyle f:X\\to Y} is a morphism of geometric or algebraic objects, the corresponding cotangent complex L X / Y ∙ {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {L} _{X/Y}^{\\bullet }} can be thought of as a universal \"linearization\" of it, which serves to control the deformation theory of f {\\displaystyle f} .[1][2] It is constructed as an object in a certain derived category of sheaves on X {\\displaystyle X} using the methods of homotopical algebra.","image":"abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c.svg","url":"Cotangent_complex"}
