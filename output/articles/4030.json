{"title":"Deviation (statistics)","summary":"In mathematics and statistics, deviation is a measure of difference between the observed value of a variable and some other value, often that variable's mean. The sign of the deviation reports the direction of that difference (the deviation is positive when the observed value exceeds the reference value). The magnitude of the value indicates the size of the difference.","image":"61b5d9976a2a696f3c23ced5ad7a11b875d2a19d.svg","url":"Deviation_(statistics)"}
