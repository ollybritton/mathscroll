{"title":"Subsequence","summary":"In mathematics, a subsequence of a given sequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence ⟨ A , B , D ⟩ {\\displaystyle \\langle A,B,D\\rangle } is a subsequence of ⟨ A , B , C , D , E , F ⟩ {\\displaystyle \\langle A,B,C,D,E,F\\rangle } obtained after removal of elements C , {\\displaystyle C,} E , {\\displaystyle E,} and F . {\\displaystyle F.} The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of another is a preorder.","image":"2e6c6378d093f29e71cd3f1d7485de88d5ddda49.svg","url":"Subsequence"}
