{"title":"Wolf Prize in Mathematics","summary":"The Wolf Prize in Mathematics is awarded almost annually[lower-alpha 1] by the Wolf Foundation in Israel. It is one of the six Wolf Prizes established by the Foundation and awarded since 1978; the others are in Agriculture, Chemistry, Medicine, Physics and Arts. According to a reputation survey conducted in 2013 and 2014, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics is the third most prestigious international academic award in mathematics, after the Abel Prize and the Fields Medal.[1][2] Until the establishment of the Abel Prize, it was probably the closest equivalent of a \"Nobel Prize in Mathematics\", since the Fields Medal is awarded every four years only to mathematicians under the age of 40.","image":"Flag_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg.png.webp","url":"Wolf_Prize_in_Mathematics"}
