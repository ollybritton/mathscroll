{"title":"Arithmetic (book)","summary":"Arithmetic (Russian: Арифметика, romanized: Arifmetika) is a 1703 mathematics textbook by the Russian educator and mathematician Leonty Magnitsky. The book served as the standard Russian mathematics textbook until the mid-18th century. Mikhail Lomonosov was educated on this book, and referred to it as the \"gates of my own erudition\".[1] It was the first mathematics textbook written in the Russian language that was not a translated edition of a foreign work.[2] It consisted essentially of Magnitsky's own lecture notes, and offered an encyclopedic overview of arithmetic at the time, with sections on navigational astronomy, geodesy, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.[2]","image":"«Арифметика»_Магницкого_06._Арифметика_на_троне.jpg.webp","url":"Arithmetic_(book)"}
