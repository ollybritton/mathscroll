{"title":"Hecke character","summary":"In number theory, a Hecke character is a generalisation of a Dirichlet character, introduced by Erich Hecke to construct a class of L-functions larger than Dirichlet L-functions, and a natural setting for the Dedekind zeta-functions and certain others which have functional equations analogous to that of the Riemann zeta-function.","image":"bd4dc8fba33c3d1249a2f978d64e43fa333f1de9.svg","url":"Hecke_character"}
