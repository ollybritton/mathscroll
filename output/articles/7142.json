{"title":"Heterotic string theory","summary":"In string theory, a heterotic string is a closed string (or loop) which is a hybrid ('heterotic') of a superstring and a bosonic string. There are two kinds of heterotic string, the heterotic SO(32) and the heterotic E8 × E8, abbreviated to HO and HE. Heterotic string theory was first developed in 1985 by David Gross, Jeffrey Harvey, Emil Martinec, and Ryan Rohm[1] (the so-called \"Princeton string quartet\"[2]), in one of the key papers that fueled the first superstring revolution.","image":"Calabi_yau_formatted.svg.png.webp","url":"Heterotic_string_theory"}
