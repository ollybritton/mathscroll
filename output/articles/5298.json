{"title":"Fast inverse square root","summary":"Fast inverse square root, sometimes referred to as Fast InvSqrt() or by the hexadecimal constant 0x5F3759DF, is an algorithm that estimates 1 x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {x}}}} , the reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the square root of a 32-bit floating-point number x {\\displaystyle x} in IEEE 754 floating-point format. This operation is used in digital signal processing to normalize a vector, such as scaling it to length 1. For example, computer graphics programs use inverse square roots to compute angles of incidence and reflection for lighting and shading. Predated by similar video game algorithms, this one is best known for its implementation in 1999 in Quake III Arena, a first-person shooter video game heavily based on 3D graphics. The algorithm only started appearing on public forums between 2002 and 2003.[note 1] Computation of square roots usually depends upon many division operations, which for floating point numbers are computationally expensive. The fast inverse square generates a good approximation with only one division step.","image":"080a33b7fb940dfde4d893093e55096f6bf149dc.svg","url":"Fast_inverse_square_root"}
