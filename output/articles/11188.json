{"title":"Nonlocal operator","summary":"In mathematics, a nonlocal operator is a mapping which maps functions on a topological space to functions, in such a way that the value of the output function at a given point cannot be determined solely from the values of the input function in any neighbourhood of any point. An example of a nonlocal operator is the Fourier transform.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Nonlocal_operator"}
