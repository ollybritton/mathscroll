{"title":"Parallel curve","summary":"A parallel of a curve is the envelope of a family of congruent circles centered on the curve. It generalises the concept of parallel (straight) lines. It can also be defined as a curve whose points are at a constant normal distance from a given curve.[1] These two definitions are not entirely equivalent as the latter assumes smoothness, whereas the former does not.[2]","image":"Offset-curves-of-sinus-curve.svg.png.webp","url":"Parallel_curve"}
