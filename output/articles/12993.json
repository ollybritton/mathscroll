{"title":"Quotient space (linear algebra)","summary":"In linear algebra, the quotient of a vector space V by a subspace N is a vector space obtained by \"collapsing\" N to zero. The space obtained is called a quotient space and is denoted V/N (read \"V mod N\" or \"V by N\").","image":"d34c2f5338a2354fd2951e7e7ece12325e3853e5.svg","url":"Quotient_space_(linear_algebra)"}
