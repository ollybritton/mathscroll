{"title":"Pfeffer integral","summary":"In mathematics, the Pfeffer integral is an integration technique created by Washek Pfeffer as an attempt to extend the Henstockâ€“Kurzweil integral to a multidimensional domain. This was to be done in such a way that the fundamental theorem of calculus would apply analogously to the theorem in one dimension, with as few preconditions on the function under consideration as possible. The integral also permits analogues of the chain rule and other theorems of the integral calculus for higher dimensions.","image":"6497c9a2bc10a758100aed9f6a10b714da06b659.svg","url":"Pfeffer_integral"}
