{"title":"Collage theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the collage theorem characterises an iterated function system whose attractor is close, relative to the Hausdorff metric, to a given set. The IFS described is composed of contractions whose images, as a collage or union when mapping the given set, are arbitrarily close to the given set. It is typically used in fractal compression.","image":"01c0954f67c8e841542d7ac6a8472c4ea739824b.svg","url":"Collage_theorem"}
