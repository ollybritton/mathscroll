{"title":"Lyapunov dimension","summary":"In the mathematics of dynamical systems, the concept of Lyapunov dimension was suggested by Kaplan and Yorke[1] for estimating the Hausdorff dimension of attractors. Further the concept has been developed and rigorously justified in a number of papers, and nowadays various different approaches to the definition of Lyapunov dimension are used. Remark that the attractors with noninteger Hausdorff dimension are called strange attractors.[2] Since the direct numerical computation of the Hausdorff dimension of attractors is often a problem of high numerical complexity, estimations via the Lyapunov dimension became widely spread. The Lyapunov dimension was named[3] after the Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov because of the close connection with the Lyapunov exponents.","image":"acbb7880ab9a628b78e033c8b0cfb3f0b21a33e6.svg","url":"Lyapunov_dimension"}
