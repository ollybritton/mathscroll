{"title":"Linear span","summary":"In mathematics, the linear span (also called the linear hull[1] or just span) of a set S of vectors (from a vector space), denoted span(S),[2] is defined as the set of all linear combinations of the vectors in S.[3] For example, two linearly independent vectors span a plane. It can be characterized either as the intersection of all linear subspaces that contain S, or as the smallest subspace containing S. The linear span of a set of vectors is therefore a vector space itself. Spans can be generalized to matroids and modules.","image":"Basis_for_a_plane.svg.png.webp","url":"Linear_span"}
