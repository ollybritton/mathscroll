{"title":"Multiplicative digital root","summary":"In number theory, the multiplicative digital root of a natural number n {\\displaystyle n} in a given number base b {\\displaystyle b} is found by multiplying the digits of n {\\displaystyle n} together, then repeating this operation until only a single-digit remains, which is called the multiplicative digital root of n {\\displaystyle n} .[1][2] The multiplicative digital root for the first few positive integers are:","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Multiplicative_digital_root"}
