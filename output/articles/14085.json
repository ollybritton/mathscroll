{"title":"Self-adjoint","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, an element x of a *-algebra is self-adjoint if x âˆ— = x {\\displaystyle x^{*}=x} . A self-adjoint element is also  Hermitian, though the reverse doesn't necessarily hold.","image":"b05de1baab9f6b4e9b9c86d49251c0ceebc77663.svg","url":"Self-adjoint"}
