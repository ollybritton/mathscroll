{"title":"Constructions in hyperbolic geometry","summary":"Hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry where the first four axioms of Euclidean geometry are kept but the fifth axiom, the parallel postulate, is changed. The fifth axiom of hyperbolic geometry says that given a line L and a point P not on that line, there are at least two lines passing through P that are parallel to L.[1] As in Euclidean geometry, where ancient Greek mathematicians used a compass and idealized ruler for constructions of lengths, angles, and other geometric figures, constructions can also be made in hyperbolic geometry.","image":"Pseudosphere.jpg.webp","url":"Constructions_in_hyperbolic_geometry"}
