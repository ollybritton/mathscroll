{"title":"IP (complexity)","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the class IP (interactive polynomial time) is the class of problems solvable by an interactive proof system. It is equal to the class PSPACE. The result was established in a series of papers: the first by Lund, Karloff, Fortnow, and Nisan showed that co-NP had multiple prover interactive proofs;[1] and the second, by Shamir, employed their technique to establish that IP=PSPACE.[2] The result is a famous example where the proof does not relativize.[3]","image":"Interactive_proof_(complexity).svg.png.webp","url":"IP_(complexity)"}
