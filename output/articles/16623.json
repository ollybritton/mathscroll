{"title":"Visual Turing Test","summary":"Computer vision research is driven by standard evaluation practices. The current systems are tested by their accuracy for tasks like object detection, segmentation and localization. Methods like the convolutional neural networks seem to be doing pretty well in these tasks, but the current systems are still not close to solving the ultimate problem of understanding images the way humans do. So motivated by the ability of humans to understand an image and even tell a story about it, Geman et al. have introduced the Visual Turing Test for computer vision systems.","image":"Sample_questions.png.webp","url":"Visual_Turing_Test"}
