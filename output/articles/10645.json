{"title":"Monochromatic triangle","summary":"In graph theory and theoretical computer science, the monochromatic triangle problem is an algorithmic problem on graphs, in which the goal is to partition the edges of a given graph into two triangle-free subgraphs. It is NP-complete but fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of bounded treewidth.","image":"RamseyTheory_K5_no_mono_K3.svg.png.webp","url":"Monochromatic_triangle"}
