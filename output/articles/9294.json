{"title":"Like terms","summary":"In mathematics, like terms are summands  in a sum that differ only by a numerical factor.[1] Like terms can be regrouped by adding their coefficients. Typically, in a polynomial expression, like terms are those that contain the same variables to the same powers, possibly with different coefficients.","image":"a348bbc3beddaf6031aacbc7a000d132844cbe0d.svg","url":"Like_terms"}
