{"title":"Meyniel graph","summary":"In graph theory, a Meyniel graph is a graph in which every odd cycle of length five or more has at least two chords (edges connecting non-consecutive vertices of the cycle).[1] The chords may be uncrossed (as shown in the figure) or they may cross each other, as long as there are at least two of them.","image":"Chordal-graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Meyniel_graph"}
