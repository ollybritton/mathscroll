{"title":"Chamfered dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the chamfered dodecahedron is a convex polyhedron with 80 vertices, 120 edges, and 42 faces: 30 hexagons and 12 pentagons. It is constructed as a chamfer (edge-truncation) of a regular dodecahedron. The pentagons are reduced in size and new hexagonal faces are added in place of all the original edges. Its dual is the pentakis icosidodecahedron.","image":"Truncated_rhombic_triacontahedron.png.webp","url":"Chamfered_dodecahedron"}
