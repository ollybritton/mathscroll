{"title":"Simple polytope","summary":"In geometry, a d-dimensional simple polytope is a d-dimensional polytope each of whose vertices are adjacent to exactly d edges (also d facets). The vertex figure of a simple d-polytope is a (d â€“ 1)-simplex.[1]","image":"Associahedron_K5.svg.png.webp","url":"Simple_polytope"}
