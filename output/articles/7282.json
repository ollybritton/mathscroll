{"title":"Hirsch conjecture","summary":"In mathematical programming and polyhedral combinatorics, the Hirsch conjecture is the statement that the edge-vertex graph of an n-facet polytope in d-dimensional Euclidean space has diameter no more than n − d. That is, any two vertices of the polytope must be connected to each other by a path of length at most n − d.  The conjecture was first put forth in a letter by Warren M. Hirsch to George B. Dantzig in 1957[1][2] and was motivated by the analysis of the simplex method in linear programming, as the diameter of a polytope provides a lower bound on the number of steps needed by the simplex method.  The conjecture is now known to be false in general.","image":"Icosidodecahedral_graph.png.webp","url":"Hirsch_conjecture"}
