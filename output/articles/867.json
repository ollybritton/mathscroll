{"title":"Antiisomorphism","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, an antiisomorphism (or anti-isomorphism) between structured sets A and B is an isomorphism from A to the opposite of B (or equivalently from the opposite of A to B).[1] If there exists an antiisomorphism between two structures, they are said to be antiisomorphic.","image":"53e574cc3aa5b4bf5f3f5906caf121a378eef08b.svg","url":"Antiisomorphism"}
