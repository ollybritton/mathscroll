{"title":"Birkhoff–Grothendieck theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Birkhoff–Grothendieck theorem classifies holomorphic vector bundles over the complex projective line. In particular every holomorphic vector bundle over C P 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {CP} ^{1}} is a direct sum of holomorphic line bundles. The theorem was proved by Alexander Grothendieck (1957, Theorem 2.1),[1] and is more or less equivalent to  Birkhoff factorization introduced by George David Birkhoff (1909).[2]","image":"82c98c461bccbd4567716df0a6a2ff97bf9371af.svg","url":"Birkhoff–Grothendieck_theorem"}
