{"title":"Centered octahedral number","summary":"A centered octahedral number or Haüy octahedral number is a figurate number that counts the number of points of a three-dimensional integer lattice that lie inside an octahedron centered at the origin.[1] The same numbers are special cases of the Delannoy numbers, which count certain two-dimensional lattice paths.[2] The Haüy octahedral numbers are named after René Just Haüy.","image":"Haüy_construction_129.svg.png.webp","url":"Centered_octahedral_number"}
