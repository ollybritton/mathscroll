{"title":"Discrete measure","summary":"In mathematics, more precisely in measure theory, a  measure  on the real line is called a discrete measure (in respect to the Lebesgue measure) if it is concentrated on an at most countable set. The support need not be a discrete set. Geometrically, a discrete measure (on the real line, with respect to Lebesgue measure) is a collection of point masses.","image":"Dirac_distribution_PDF.svg.png.webp","url":"Discrete_measure"}
