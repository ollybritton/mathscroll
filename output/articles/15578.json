{"title":"Tensor reshaping","summary":"In multilinear algebra, a reshaping of tensors is any bijection between the set of indices of an order- M {\\displaystyle M} tensor and the set of indices of an order- L {\\displaystyle L} tensor, where L < M {\\displaystyle L<M} .  The use of indices presupposes tensors in coordinate representation with respect to a basis.  The coordinate representation of a tensor can be regarded as a multi-dimensional array, and a bijection from one set of indices to another therefore amounts to a rearrangement of the array elements into an array of a different shape.  Such Â°a rearrangement constitutes a particular kind of linear map between the vector space of order- M {\\displaystyle M} tensors and the vector space of order- L {\\displaystyle L} tensors.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Tensor_reshaping"}
