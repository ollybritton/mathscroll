{"title":"Ordered topological vector space","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in functional analysis and order theory, an ordered topological vector space, also called an ordered TVS, is a topological vector space (TVS) X that has a partial order ≤ making it into an ordered vector space whose positive cone C := { x ∈ X : x ≥ 0 } {\\displaystyle C:=\\left\\{x\\in X:x\\geq 0\\right\\}} is a closed subset of X.[1] Ordered TVS have important applications in spectral theory.","image":"26fc5a9a3fdd2be6cad19b4d0c252f7c723f1390.svg","url":"Ordered_topological_vector_space"}
