{"title":"Induction-recursion","summary":"In intuitionistic type theory (ITT), a discipline within mathematical logic, induction-recursion is a feature for simultaneously declaring a type and function on that type.  It allows the creation of larger types, such as universes, than inductive types.  The types created still remain predicative inside ITT.","image":"f34a0c600395e5d4345287e21fb26efd386990e6.svg","url":"Induction-recursion"}
