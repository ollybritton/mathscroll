{"title":"Redshift conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in chromatic homotopy theory, the redshift conjecture states, roughly, that algebraic K-theory K ( R ) {\\displaystyle K(R)} has chromatic level one higher than that of a complex-oriented ring spectrum R.[1] It was formulated by John Rognes in a lecture at Schloss Ringberg, Germany, in January 1999, and made more precise by him in a lecture at Mathematische Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach, Germany, in September 2000.[2] In July 2022, Burklund, Schlank and Yuan announced a solution of a version of the redshift conjecture for arbitrary E âˆž {\\displaystyle E_{\\infty }} -ring spectra, after Hahn and Wilson did so earlier in the case of the truncated Brown-Peterson spectra BP<n>.[3]","image":"42635750b8c4ee9a5274f79135881d7fdfbf4a00.svg","url":"Redshift_conjecture"}
