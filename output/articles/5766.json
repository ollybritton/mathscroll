{"title":"Frobenius formula","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in representation theory, the Frobenius formula, introduced by G. Frobenius, computes the characters of irreducible representations of the symmetric group Sn. Among the other applications, the formula can be used to derive the hook length formula.","image":"dbd0e416e02a215304e4b13837c55e1a06acbfd9.svg","url":"Frobenius_formula"}
