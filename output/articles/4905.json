{"title":"Equichordal point","summary":"In geometry, an equichordal point is a point defined relative to a convex plane curve such that all chords passing through the point are equal in length. Two common figures with equichordal points are the circle and the lima√ßon.  It is impossible for a curve to have more than one equichordal point.","image":"Equichordal-center.svg.png.webp","url":"Equichordal_point"}
