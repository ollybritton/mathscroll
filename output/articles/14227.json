{"title":"Set packing","summary":"Set packing is a classical NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory and combinatorics, and was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. Suppose one has a finite set S and a list of subsets of S. Then, the set packing problem asks if some k subsets in the list are pairwise disjoint (in other words, no two of them share an element).","image":"4e63ea009de5efbca2fc285b8550daaed577c6b8.svg","url":"Set_packing"}
