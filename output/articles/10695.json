{"title":"Moore–Penrose inverse","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular linear algebra, the Moore–Penrose inverse A + {\\displaystyle A^{+}} of a matrix A {\\displaystyle A} is the most widely known generalization of the inverse matrix.[1][2][3][4] It was independently described by E. H. Moore[5] in 1920, Arne Bjerhammar[6] in 1951, and Roger Penrose[7] in 1955. Earlier, Erik Ivar Fredholm had introduced the concept of a pseudoinverse of integral operators in 1903. When referring to a matrix, the term pseudoinverse, without further specification, is often used to indicate the Moore–Penrose inverse. The term generalized inverse is sometimes used as a synonym for pseudoinverse.","image":"b380a5ff4e2d7d22a0dc1aea46e7ecba61f95fe6.svg","url":"Moore–Penrose_inverse"}
