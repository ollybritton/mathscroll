{"title":"Isotropy","summary":"In physics and geometry, isotropy (from Ancient Greek  ἴσος (ísos) 'equal', and  τρόπος (trópos) 'turn, way') is uniformity in all orientations. Precise definitions depend on the subject area. Exceptions, or inequalities, are frequently indicated by the prefix a- or an-, hence anisotropy. Anisotropy is also used to describe situations where properties vary systematically, dependent on direction. Isotropic radiation has the same intensity regardless of the direction of measurement, and an isotropic field exerts the same action regardless of how the test particle is oriented.","image":"LvMS-Lvv.jpg.webp","url":"Isotropy"}
