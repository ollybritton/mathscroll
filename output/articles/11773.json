{"title":"Paracompact space","summary":"In mathematics, a paracompact space is a topological space in which every open cover has an open refinement that is locally finite. These spaces were introduced by Dieudonn√© (1944). Every compact space is paracompact. Every paracompact Hausdorff space is normal, and a Hausdorff space is paracompact if and only if it admits partitions of unity subordinate to any open cover.  Sometimes paracompact spaces are defined so as to always be Hausdorff.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Paracompact_space"}
