{"title":"Grothendieck group","summary":"In mathematics, the Grothendieck group, or group of differences,[1] of a commutative monoid M is a certain abelian group. This abelian group is constructed from M in the most universal way, in the sense that any abelian group containing a homomorphic image of M will also contain a homomorphic image of the Grothendieck group of M. The Grothendieck group construction takes its name from a specific case in category theory, introduced by Alexander Grothendieck in his proof of the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem, which resulted in the development of K-theory. This specific case is the monoid of isomorphism classes of objects of an abelian category, with the direct sum as its operation.","image":"3bf17ce351d08f2b7a3e54ba3aa2132f260c84f6.svg","url":"Grothendieck_group"}
