{"title":"Divine Proportions: Rational Trigonometry to Universal Geometry","summary":"Divine Proportions: Rational Trigonometry to Universal Geometry is a 2005 book by the mathematician Norman J. Wildberger on a proposed alternative approach to Euclidean geometry and trigonometry, called rational trigonometry.  The book advocates replacing the usual basic quantities of trigonometry, Euclidean distance and angle measure, by squared distance and the square of the sine of the angle, respectively.  This is logically equivalent to the standard development (as the replacement quantities can be expressed in terms of the standard ones and vice versa). The author claims his approach holds some advantages, such as avoiding the need for irrational numbers.","image":"0a143d96171f10b61bfc6322f7e2f971c3d764f5.svg","url":"Divine_Proportions:_Rational_Trigonometry_to_Universal_Geometry"}
