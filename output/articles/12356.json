{"title":"Polynomial solutions of P-recursive equations","summary":"In mathematics a P-recursive equation can be solved for polynomial solutions. Sergei A. Abramov in 1989 and Marko Petkov≈°ek in 1992 described an algorithm which finds all polynomial solutions of those recurrence equations with polynomial coefficients.[1][2] The algorithm computes a degree bound for the solution in a first step. In a second step an ansatz for a polynomial of this degree is used and the unknown coefficients are computed by a system of linear equations. This article describes this algorithm.","image":"8eabb41ebede2478524a244822b19a2a0282d766.svg","url":"Polynomial_solutions_of_P-recursive_equations"}
