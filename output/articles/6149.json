{"title":"Geometric mean","summary":"In mathematics, the geometric mean is a mean or average which indicates a central tendency of a finite set of real numbers by using the product of their values (as opposed to the arithmetic mean which uses their sum).  The geometric mean is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers, i.e., for a set of numbers a1, a2, ..., an, the geometric mean is defined as","image":"d8b67da21f4b58d3121ef21e0c5a9d040a6b65ce.svg","url":"Geometric_mean"}
