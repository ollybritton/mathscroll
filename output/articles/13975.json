{"title":"Schubert variety","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a Schubert variety is a certain subvariety of a Grassmannian, usually with singular points. Like a Grassmannian, it is a kind of moduli space, whose points correspond to certain kinds of subspaces V, specified using linear algebra, inside a fixed vector subspace W. Here W may be a vector space over an arbitrary field, though most commonly over the complex numbers.","image":"f5352d7aa4e0e171df742c650b0602830ca0cea4.svg","url":"Schubert_variety"}
