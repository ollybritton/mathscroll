{"title":"Projective plane","summary":"In mathematics, a projective plane is a geometric structure that extends the concept of a plane. In the ordinary Euclidean plane, two lines typically intersect in a single point, but there are some pairs of lines (namely, parallel lines) that do not intersect. A projective plane can be thought of as an ordinary plane equipped with additional \"points at infinity\" where parallel lines intersect. Thus any two distinct lines in a projective plane intersect at exactly one point.","image":"Finite_projective_planes.svg.png.webp","url":"Projective_plane"}
