{"title":"Moduli space","summary":"In mathematics, in particular algebraic geometry, a moduli space  is a geometric space (usually a scheme or an algebraic stack) whose points represent algebro-geometric objects of some fixed kind, or isomorphism classes of such objects.  Such spaces frequently arise as solutions to classification problems:  If one can show that a collection of interesting objects (e.g., the smooth algebraic curves of a fixed genus) can be given the structure of a geometric space, then one can parametrize such objects by introducing coordinates on the resulting space.  In this context, the term \"modulus\" is used synonymously with \"parameter\"; moduli spaces were first understood as spaces of parameters rather than as spaces of objects. A variant of moduli spaces is formal moduli. Bernhard Riemann first used the term \"moduli\" in 1857.[1]","image":"page1-220px-Real_projective_line_moduli_space_example.pdf.jpg.webp","url":"Moduli_space"}
