{"title":"Complex Lie group","summary":"In geometry, a complex Lie group is a Lie group over the complex numbers; i.e., it is a  complex-analytic manifold that is also a  group in such a way G × G → G , ( x , y ) ↦ x y − 1 {\\displaystyle G\\times G\\to G,(x,y)\\mapsto xy^{-1}} is holomorphic. Basic examples are GL n ⁡ ( C ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {GL} _{n}(\\mathbb {C} )} , the general linear groups over the complex numbers. A connected compact complex Lie group is precisely a complex torus (not to be confused with the complex Lie group C ∗ {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{*}} ). Any finite group may be given the structure of a complex Lie group. A complex semisimple Lie group is a linear algebraic group.","image":"067286a5e41fd0f5cabac6bea38558e9443f6a00.svg","url":"Complex_Lie_group"}
