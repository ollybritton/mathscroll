{"title":"Nor-","summary":"In chemical nomenclature, nor- is a prefix to name a structural analog that can be derived from a parent compound by the removal of one carbon atom along with the accompanying hydrogen atoms. The nor-compound can be derived by removal of a CH3,  CH2, or CH group, or of a C atom.  The \"nor-\" prefix also includes the elimination of a methylene bridge in a cyclic parent compound, followed by ring contraction.  (The prefix \"homo-\" which indicates the next higher member in a homologous series, is usually limited to noncyclic carbons).[1][2][3] The terms desmethyl- or demethyl- are synonyms of \"nor-\".","image":"Nor-narcotine_history_1867.png.webp","url":"Nor-"}
