{"title":"Surgery obstruction","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in surgery theory, the surgery obstructions define a map θ : N ( X ) → L n ( π 1 ( X ) ) {\\displaystyle \\theta \\colon {\\mathcal {N}}(X)\\to L_{n}(\\pi _{1}(X))} from the normal invariants to the L-groups which is in the first instance a set-theoretic map (that means not necessarily a homomorphism) with the following property when n ≥ 5 {\\displaystyle n\\geq 5} :","image":"d15cf2bbb51de27afece2937f87c644faef6c357.svg","url":"Surgery_obstruction"}
