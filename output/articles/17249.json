{"title":"σ-algebra","summary":"In mathematical analysis and in probability theory, a σ-algebra (also σ-field) on a set X is a nonempty collection Σ of subsets of X closed under complement, countable unions, and countable intersections. The ordered pair ( X , Σ ) {\\displaystyle (X,\\Sigma )} is called a measurable space.","image":"63c4fcf15808c3dbf52cc4b3fd473e97e231f53f.svg","url":"Σ-algebra"}
