{"title":"Presentation complex","summary":"In geometric group theory, a presentation complex is a 2-dimensional cell complex associated to any presentation of a group G.  The complex has a single vertex, and one loop at the vertex for each generator of G.  There is one 2-cell for each relation in the presentation, with the boundary of the 2-cell attached along the appropriate word.","image":"f30ac500e56f9a311b1e02891755822a53a99af5.svg","url":"Presentation_complex"}
