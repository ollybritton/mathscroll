{"title":"-yllion","summary":"-yllion (pronounced /aɪljən/)[1] is a proposal from Donald Knuth for the terminology and symbols of an alternate decimal superbase system. In it, he adapts the familiar English terms for large numbers to provide a systematic set of names for much larger numbers. In addition to providing an extended range, -yllion also dodges the long and short scale ambiguity of -illion.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"-yllion"}
