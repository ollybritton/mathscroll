{"title":"Eisenbud–Levine–Khimshiashvili signature formula","summary":"In mathematics, and especially differential topology and singularity theory, the Eisenbud–Levine–Khimshiashvili signature formula gives a way of computing the Poincaré–Hopf index of a real, analytic vector field at an algebraically isolated singularity.[1][2]  It is named after David Eisenbud, Harold I. Levine, and George Khimshiashvili.  Intuitively, the index of a vector field near a zero is the number of times the vector field wraps around the sphere.  Because analytic vector fields have a rich algebraic structure, the techniques of commutative algebra can be brought to bear to compute their index.  The signature formula expresses the index of an analytic vector field in terms of the signature of a certain quadratic form.","image":"2cc630b750bac23d82de16cf48b6e56171b8976d.svg","url":"Eisenbud–Levine–Khimshiashvili_signature_formula"}
