{"title":"Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction","summary":"In mathematics, the Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction or Lyapunov–Schmidt construction is used to study solutions to nonlinear equations in the case when the implicit function theorem does not work. It permits the reduction of infinite-dimensional equations in Banach spaces to finite-dimensional equations. It is named after Aleksandr Lyapunov and Erhard Schmidt.","image":"b2bd892e979e6f81a659737d1795f1200f0094c3.svg","url":"Lyapunov–Schmidt_reduction"}
