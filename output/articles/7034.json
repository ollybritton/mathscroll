{"title":"Hemiperfect number","summary":"In number theory, a hemiperfect number is a positive integer with a half-integer abundancy index. In other words, σ(n)/n = k/2 for an odd integer k, where σ(n) is the divisor function, the sum of all positive divisors of n.","image":"Lattice_of_the_divisibility_of_60.svg.png.webp","url":"Hemiperfect_number"}
