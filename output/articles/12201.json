{"title":"Plane of rotation","summary":"In geometry, a plane of rotation is an abstract object used to describe or visualize rotations in space. In three dimensions it is an alternative to the axis of rotation, but unlike the axis of rotation it can be used in other dimensions, such as two, four or more dimensions.","image":"f4342089a856a9cfbc7a2e7552a1684355c5732c.svg","url":"Plane_of_rotation"}
