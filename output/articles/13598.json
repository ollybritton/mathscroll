{"title":"Ring of polynomial functions","summary":"In mathematics, the ring of polynomial functions on a vector space V over a field k gives a coordinate-free analog of a polynomial ring. It is denoted by k[V]. If V is finite dimensional and is viewed as an algebraic variety, then k[V] is precisely the coordinate ring of V.","image":"11a644c6544ca863f145651f78d6e2a9406e47da.svg","url":"Ring_of_polynomial_functions"}
