{"title":"Bhāskara I","summary":"Bhāskara (c. 600 – c. 680) (commonly called Bhāskara I to avoid confusion with the 12th-century mathematician Bhāskara II) was a 7th-century Indian mathematician and astronomer who was the first to write numbers in the Hindu–Arabic decimal system with a circle for the zero, and who gave a unique and remarkable rational approximation of the sine function in his commentary on Aryabhata's work.[3] This commentary, Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣya, written in 629 CE, is among the oldest known prose works in Sanskrit on mathematics and astronomy. He also wrote two astronomical works in the line of Aryabhata's school: the Mahābhāskarīya (“Great Book of Bhaskara”) and the Laghubhāskarīya (“Small Book of Bhaskara”).[3][4]","image":"07d5bb3f6d056f5674789cb48e927c813f13fc9c.svg","url":"Bhāskara_I"}
