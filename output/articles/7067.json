{"title":"Heptadecahedron","summary":"A heptadecahedron (or heptakaidecahedron) is a polyhedron with 17 faces. No heptadecahedron is regular; hence, the name is ambiguous. There are numerous topologically distinct forms of a heptadecahedron, for example the hexadecagonal pyramid and pentadecagonal prism.","image":"12-3_plesiohedron.png.webp","url":"Heptadecahedron"}
