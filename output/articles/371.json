{"title":"Adelard of Bath","summary":"Adelard of Bath (Latin: Adelardus Bathensis; c. 1080? –  c. 1142–1152?) was a 12th-century English natural philosopher. He is known both for his original works and for translating many important Greek[1][2] scientific works of astrology, astronomy, philosophy, alchemy and mathematics into Latin from Arabic versions, which were then introduced to Western Europe. The oldest surviving Latin translation of Euclid's Elements is a 12th-century translation by Adelard from an Arabic version.[3] He is known as one of the first to introduce the Arabic numeral system to Europe. He stands at the convergence of three intellectual schools: the traditional learning of French schools, the Greek culture of Southern Italy, and the Arabic science of the East.[4]","image":"Adelard_of_Bath_(teaching).jpg.webp","url":"Adelard_of_Bath"}
