{"title":"Zenzizenzizenzic","summary":"Zenzizenzizenzic is an obsolete form of mathematical notation representing the eighth power of a number (that is, the zenzizenzizenzic of x is x8), dating from a time when powers were written out in words rather than as superscript numbers. This term was suggested by Robert Recorde, a 16th-century Welsh physician, mathematician and writer of popular mathematics textbooks, in his 1557 work The Whetstone of Witte (although his spelling was zenzizenzizenzike); he wrote that it \"doeth represent the square of squares squaredly\".","image":"Whetstone-of-Witte-pp-150-151.jpg.webp","url":"Zenzizenzizenzic"}
