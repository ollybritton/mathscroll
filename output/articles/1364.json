{"title":"Basis function","summary":"In mathematics,  a basis function is an element of a particular basis for a function space. Every function in the function space can be represented as a linear combination of basis functions, just as every vector in a vector space can be represented as a linear combination of basis vectors.","image":"f1c75719738455b22e5ac9d23d0846849cd25010.svg","url":"Basis_function"}
