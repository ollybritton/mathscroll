{"title":"Indefinite product","summary":"In mathematics, the indefinite product operator is the inverse operator of Q ( f ( x ) ) = f ( x + 1 ) f ( x ) {\\textstyle Q(f(x))={\\frac {f(x+1)}{f(x)}}} . It is a discrete version of the geometric integral of geometric calculus, one of the non-Newtonian calculi. Some authors use term discrete multiplicative integration.","image":"b8645c5575d1c1d95dd9de37a27629a76f2cd976.svg","url":"Indefinite_product"}
