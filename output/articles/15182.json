{"title":"Subadditivity","summary":"In mathematics, subadditivity is a property of a function that states, roughly, that evaluating the function for the sum of two elements of the domain always returns something less than or equal to the sum of the function's values at each element. There are numerous examples of subadditive functions in various areas of mathematics, particularly norms and square roots. Additive maps are special cases of subadditive functions.","image":"6dec1893560fabff9fa9c17b83b71f7f97996119.svg","url":"Subadditivity"}
