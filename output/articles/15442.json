{"title":"T(1) theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the T(1) theorem, first proved by David & Journ√© (1984), describes when an operator T given by a  kernel can be extended to  a bounded linear operator on the Hilbert space L2(Rn). The name T(1) theorem refers to a condition on the distribution T(1), given by the operator T applied to the function 1.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"T(1)_theorem"}
