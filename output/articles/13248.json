{"title":"Redheffer star product","summary":"In mathematics, the Redheffer star product is a binary operation on linear operators that arises in connection to solving coupled systems of linear equations. It was introduced by Raymond Redheffer in 1959,[1] and has subsequently been widely adopted in computational methods for scattering matrices. Given two scattering matrices from different linear scatterers, the Redheffer star product yields the combined scattering matrix produced when some or all of the output channels of one scatterer are connected to inputs of another scatterer.","image":"96c3298ea9aa77c226be56a7d8515baaa517b90b.svg","url":"Redheffer_star_product"}
