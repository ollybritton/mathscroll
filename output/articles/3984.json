{"title":"Derivative test","summary":"In calculus, a derivative test uses the derivatives of a function to locate the critical points of a function and determine whether each point is a local maximum, a local minimum, or a saddle point. Derivative tests can also give information about the concavity of a function.","image":"d1afc130bd9e57a213dbbd456b8ac44cc2b80f03.svg","url":"Derivative_test"}
