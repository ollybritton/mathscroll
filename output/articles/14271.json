{"title":"Sheaf of modules","summary":"In mathematics, a sheaf of O-modules or simply an O-module over a ringed space (X, O) is a sheaf F such that, for any open subset U of X, F(U) is an O(U)-module and the restriction maps F(U) → F(V) are compatible with the restriction maps O(U) → O(V): the restriction of fs is the restriction of f times that of s for any f in O(U) and s in F(U).","image":"a16ec565233e46a4c1f7107e2e86e4b222f4d80f.svg","url":"Sheaf_of_modules"}
