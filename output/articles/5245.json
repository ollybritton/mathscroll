{"title":"FKG inequality","summary":"In mathematics, the Fortuin–Kasteleyn–Ginibre (FKG) inequality is a correlation inequality, a fundamental tool in statistical mechanics and probabilistic combinatorics (especially random graphs and the probabilistic method), due to Cees M. Fortuin, Pieter W. Kasteleyn, and Jean Ginibre (1971). Informally, it says that in many random systems, increasing events are positively correlated, while an increasing and a decreasing event are negatively correlated. It was obtained by studying the random cluster model.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"FKG_inequality"}
