{"title":"Moyal product","summary":"In mathematics, the Moyal product (after José Enrique Moyal; also called the star product or Weyl–Groenewold product, after Hermann Weyl and Hilbrand J. Groenewold) is an example of a phase-space star product.  It is an associative, non-commutative product, ★,   on the functions on ℝ2n,  equipped with its Poisson bracket (with a generalization to symplectic manifolds, described below).  It is a special case of the ★-product of the \"algebra of symbols\" of a universal enveloping algebra.","image":"100e63ca64f68d43c3bc88209ea073c385cda72b.svg","url":"Moyal_product"}
