{"title":"Schubert calculus","summary":"In mathematics, Schubert calculus is a branch of algebraic geometry introduced in the nineteenth century by Hermann Schubert, in order to solve various counting problems of projective geometry (part of enumerative geometry). It was a precursor of several more modern theories, for example characteristic classes, and in particular its algorithmic aspects are still of current interest. The phrase \"Schubert calculus\" is sometimes used to mean the enumerative geometry of linear subspaces, roughly equivalent to describing the cohomology ring of Grassmannians, and sometimes used to mean the more general enumerative geometry of nonlinear varieties. Even more generally, \"Schubert calculus\" is often understood to encompass the study of analogous questions in generalized cohomology theories.","image":"02b80a4d77e4b822aa40619aa0549c87be3421b9.svg","url":"Schubert_calculus"}
