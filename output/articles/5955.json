{"title":"Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture is a restriction problem in the representation theory of real or p-adic Lie groups posed by Gan Wee Teck, Benedict Gross, and Dipendra Prasad.[1] The problem originated from a conjecture of Gross and Prasad for special orthogonal groups but was later generalized to include all four classical groups. In the cases considered, it is known that the multiplicity of the restrictions is at most one[2][3][4] and the conjecture describes when the multiplicity is precisely one.","image":"9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a.svg","url":"Gan–Gross–Prasad_conjecture"}
