{"title":"Cofinal (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a subset B ⊆ A {\\displaystyle B\\subseteq A} of a preordered set ( A , ≤ ) {\\displaystyle (A,\\leq )} is said to be cofinal or frequent[1] in A {\\displaystyle A} if for every a ∈ A , {\\displaystyle a\\in A,} it is possible to find an element b {\\displaystyle b} in B {\\displaystyle B} that is \"larger than a {\\displaystyle a} \" (explicitly, \"larger than a {\\displaystyle a} \" means a ≤ b {\\displaystyle a\\leq b} ).","image":"fb8124cb68686ede7083aa2a5a821f262eb62954.svg","url":"Cofinal_(mathematics)"}
