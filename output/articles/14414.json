{"title":"Simplicial homology","summary":"In algebraic topology, simplicial homology is the sequence of homology groups of a simplicial complex. It formalizes the idea of the number of holes of a given dimension in the complex. This generalizes the number of connected components (the case of dimension 0).","image":"Simplicial_homology_-_exactness_of_boundary_maps.svg.png.webp","url":"Simplicial_homology"}
