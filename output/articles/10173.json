{"title":"Matroid rank","summary":"In the mathematical theory of matroids, the rank of a matroid is the maximum size of an independent set in the matroid. The rank of a subset S of elements of the matroid is, similarly, the maximum size of an independent subset of S, and the rank function of the matroid maps sets of elements to their ranks.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Matroid_rank"}
