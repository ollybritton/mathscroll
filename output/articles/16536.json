{"title":"Vector bundle","summary":"In mathematics, a vector bundle is a topological construction that makes precise the idea of a family of vector spaces parameterized by another space X {\\displaystyle X} (for example X {\\displaystyle X} could be a topological space, a manifold, or an algebraic variety): to every point x {\\displaystyle x} of the space X {\\displaystyle X} we associate (or \"attach\") a vector space V ( x ) {\\displaystyle V(x)} in such a way that these vector spaces fit together to form another space of the same kind as X {\\displaystyle X} (e.g. a topological space, manifold, or algebraic variety), which is then called a vector bundle over X {\\displaystyle X} .","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Vector_bundle"}
