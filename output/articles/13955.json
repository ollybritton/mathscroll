{"title":"Schoof's algorithm","summary":"Schoof's algorithm is an efficient algorithm to count points on elliptic curves over finite fields. The algorithm has applications in elliptic curve cryptography where it is important to know the number of points to judge the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem in the group of points on an elliptic curve.","image":"4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b.svg","url":"Schoof's_algorithm"}
