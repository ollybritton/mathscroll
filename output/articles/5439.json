{"title":"Finite difference coefficient","summary":"In mathematics, to approximate a derivative to an arbitrary order of accuracy, it is possible to use the finite difference.  A finite difference can be central,  forward or backward.","image":"83d5cbb424bd756ccf14c843e6d845712ff87bc5.svg","url":"Finite_difference_coefficient"}
