{"title":"Beilinson–Bernstein localization","summary":"In mathematics, especially in representation theory and algebraic geometry, the Beilinson–Bernstein localization theorem relates D-modules on flag varieties G/B to representations of the Lie algebra g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} attached to a reductive group G. It was introduced by Beilinson & Bernstein (1981).","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Beilinson–Bernstein_localization"}
