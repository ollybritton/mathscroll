{"title":"Crossed module","summary":"In mathematics, and especially in homotopy theory, a crossed module consists of groups G {\\displaystyle G} and H {\\displaystyle H} , where G {\\displaystyle G} acts on H {\\displaystyle H} by automorphisms (which we will write on the left, ( g , h ) ↦ g ⋅ h {\\displaystyle (g,h)\\mapsto g\\cdot h} , and a homomorphism of groups","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Crossed_module"}
