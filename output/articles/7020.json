{"title":"Helly's theorem","summary":"Helly's theorem is a basic result in discrete geometry on the intersection of convex sets. It was discovered by Eduard Helly in 1913,[1] but not published by him until 1923, by which time alternative proofs by Radon (1921) and KÃ¶nig (1922) had already appeared. Helly's theorem gave rise to the notion of a Helly family.","image":"Helly's_theorem.svg.png.webp","url":"Helly's_theorem"}
