{"title":"Blaschke selection theorem","summary":"The Blaschke selection theorem is a result in topology and convex geometry about sequences of convex sets.  Specifically, given a sequence { K n } {\\displaystyle \\{K_{n}\\}} of convex sets contained in a bounded set, the theorem guarantees the existence of a subsequence { K n m } {\\displaystyle \\{K_{n_{m}}\\}} and a convex set K {\\displaystyle K} such that K n m {\\displaystyle K_{n_{m}}} converges to K {\\displaystyle K} in the Hausdorff metric.  The theorem is named for Wilhelm Blaschke.","image":"b84b509befa470e8737b12a4c868c775c18014d9.svg","url":"Blaschke_selection_theorem"}
