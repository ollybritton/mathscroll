{"title":"Linking number","summary":"In mathematics, the linking number is a numerical invariant that describes the linking of two closed curves in three-dimensional space.  Intuitively, the linking number represents the number of times that each curve winds around the other.  In Euclidean space, the linking number is always an integer, but may be positive or negative depending on the orientation of the two curves (this is not true for curves in most 3-manifolds, where linking numbers can also be fractions or just not exist at all).","image":"3D-Link.PNG.webp","url":"Linking_number"}
