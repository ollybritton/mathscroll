{"title":"Calkin correspondence","summary":"In mathematics, the Calkin correspondence, named after mathematician John Williams Calkin, is a bijective correspondence between two-sided ideals of bounded linear operators of a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and Calkin sequence spaces (also called rearrangement invariant sequence spaces).  The correspondence is implemented by mapping an operator to its singular value sequence.","image":"649f2840ab039c5b149951a23887d76ffa0ba7b5.svg","url":"Calkin_correspondence"}
