{"title":"Basic hypergeometric series","summary":"In mathematics, basic hypergeometric series, or q-hypergeometric series, are q-analogue generalizations of generalized hypergeometric series, and are in turn generalized by elliptic hypergeometric series. A series xn is called hypergeometric if the ratio of successive terms xn+1/xn is a rational function of n.  If the ratio of successive terms is a rational function of qn, then the series is called a basic hypergeometric series. The number q is called the base.","image":"f7199506e1bcc6bf6f18862b4a76595a433c4a16.svg","url":"Basic_hypergeometric_series"}
