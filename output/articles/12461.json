{"title":"Prenex normal form","summary":"A formula of the predicate calculus is in prenex[1] normal form (PNF) if it is written as a string of quantifiers and bound variables, called the prefix, followed by a quantifier-free part, called the matrix.[2] Together with the normal forms in propositional logic (e.g. disjunctive normal form or conjunctive normal form), it provides a canonical normal form useful in automated theorem proving.","image":"db7ffe2f7daf9bae8d3f2711b2fd67348aceb3dc.svg","url":"Prenex_normal_form"}
