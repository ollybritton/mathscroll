{"title":"Lebesgue's density theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Lebesgue's density theorem states that for any Lebesgue measurable set A âŠ‚ R n {\\displaystyle A\\subset \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} , the \"density\" of A is 0 or 1 at almost every point in R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} . Additionally, the \"density\" of A is 1 at almost every point in A.   Intuitively, this means that the \"edge\" of A, the set of points in A whose \"neighborhood\" is partially in A and partially outside of A, is negligible.","image":"318775bb74ed5ea047c4b1208f62992b4a4e4e2b.svg","url":"Lebesgue's_density_theorem"}
