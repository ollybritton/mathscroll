{"title":"Pseudo-monotone operator","summary":"In mathematics, a pseudo-monotone operator from a reflexive Banach space into its continuous dual space is one that is, in some sense, almost as well-behaved as a monotone operator. Many problems in the calculus of variations can be expressed using operators that are pseudo-monotone, and pseudo-monotonicity in turn implies the existence of solutions to these problems.","image":"a401b8e78e59048f3408e52b81a59b450df87e80.svg","url":"Pseudo-monotone_operator"}
