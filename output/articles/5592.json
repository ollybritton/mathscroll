{"title":"Formation rule","summary":"In mathematical logic, formation rules are rules for describing which strings of symbols formed from the alphabet of a formal language are syntactically valid within the language.[1] These rules only address the location and manipulation of the strings of the language. It does not describe anything else about a language, such as its semantics (i.e. what the strings mean). (See also formal grammar).","image":"fa78fd02085d39aa58c9e47a6d4033ce41e02fad.svg","url":"Formation_rule"}
