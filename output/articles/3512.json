{"title":"Covering graph","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, a graph C is a covering graph of another graph G if there is a covering map from the vertex set of C to the vertex set of G. A covering map f is a surjection and a local isomorphism: the neighbourhood of a vertex v in C is mapped bijectively onto the neighbourhood of f ( v ) {\\displaystyle f(v)} in G.","image":"92b2b785b7b6d9a22484d466da88d6328ed0b197.svg","url":"Covering_graph"}
