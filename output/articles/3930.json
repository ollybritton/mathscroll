{"title":"Delta-convergence","summary":"In mathematics, Delta-convergence, or Î”-convergence, is a mode of convergence in metric spaces, weaker than the usual metric convergence, and similar to (but distinct from) the weak convergence in Banach spaces. In Hilbert space, Delta-convergence and weak convergence coincide. For a general class of spaces, similarly to weak convergence, every bounded sequence has a Delta-convergent subsequence. Delta convergence was first introduced by Teck-Cheong Lim,[1] and, soon after, under the name of almost convergence, by Tadeusz Kuczumow.[2]","image":"9c03ec3abdeddde419f4f842f850836397640565.svg","url":"Delta-convergence"}
