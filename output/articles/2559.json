{"title":"Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Chern theorem (or the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem[1][2][3] after Shiing-Shen Chern, Carl Friedrich Gauss, and Pierre Ossian Bonnet) states that the Euler–Poincaré characteristic (a topological invariant defined as the alternating sum of the Betti numbers of a topological space) of a closed even-dimensional Riemannian manifold is equal to the integral of a certain polynomial (the Euler class) of its curvature form (an analytical invariant).","image":"69ffae6b1f44a73aa5aef5597b200d69603155ff.svg","url":"Chern–Gauss–Bonnet_theorem"}
