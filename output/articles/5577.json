{"title":"Forking lemma","summary":"The forking lemma is any of a number of related lemmas in cryptography research.  The lemma states that if an adversary (typically a probabilistic Turing machine), on inputs drawn from some distribution, produces an output that has some property with non-negligible probability, then with non-negligible probability, if the adversary is re-run on new inputs but with the same random tape, its second output will also have the property.","image":"beaa1256f32f15a46653a6161c5da308b7b9cf13.svg","url":"Forking_lemma"}
