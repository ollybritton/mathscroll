{"title":"Orbit capacity","summary":"In mathematics, orbit capacity of a subset of a topological dynamical system may be thought of heuristically as a “topological dynamical probability measure” of the subset. More precisely, its value for a set is a tight upper bound for the normalized number of visits of orbits in this set.","image":"1eed0190cb71bdd9c20441f33d422a67307155d5.svg","url":"Orbit_capacity"}
