{"title":"Integral of inverse functions","summary":"In mathematics, integrals of inverse functions can be computed by means of a formula that expresses the antiderivatives of the inverse f − 1 {\\displaystyle f^{-1}} of a continuous and invertible function f {\\displaystyle f} , in terms of f − 1 {\\displaystyle f^{-1}} and an antiderivative of f {\\displaystyle f} .  This formula was published in 1905 by Charles-Ange Laisant.[1]","image":"3e5cfa2f5c08d6fe7d046b73faa6e3f213acc802.svg","url":"Integral_of_inverse_functions"}
