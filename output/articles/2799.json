{"title":"Co-Büchi automaton","summary":"In automata theory, a co-Büchi automaton is a variant of Büchi automaton. The only difference is the accepting condition: a Co-Büchi automaton accepts an infinite word w {\\displaystyle w} if there exists a run, such that all the states occurring infinitely often in the run are in the final state set F {\\displaystyle F} . In contrast, a Büchi automaton accepts a word w {\\displaystyle w} if there exists a run, such that at least one state occurring infinitely often in the final state set F {\\displaystyle F} .","image":"88b1e0c8e1be5ebe69d18a8010676fa42d7961e6.svg","url":"Co-Büchi_automaton"}
