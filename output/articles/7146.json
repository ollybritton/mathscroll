{"title":"Hewitt–Savage zero–one law","summary":"The Hewitt–Savage zero–one law is a theorem in probability theory, similar to Kolmogorov's zero–one law and the Borel–Cantelli lemma, that specifies that a certain type of event will either almost surely happen or almost surely not happen. It is sometimes known as the Savage-Hewitt law for symmetric events. It is named after Edwin Hewitt and Leonard Jimmie Savage.[1]","image":"6a59fc3d5e5adafd7197084ff5b6d93fcdc89d38.svg","url":"Hewitt–Savage_zero–one_law"}
