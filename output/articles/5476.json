{"title":"First class constraint","summary":"A first class constraint is a dynamical quantity in a constrained Hamiltonian system whose Poisson bracket with all the other constraints vanishes on the constraint surface in phase space (the surface implicitly defined by the simultaneous vanishing of all the constraints). To calculate the first class constraint, one assumes that there are no second class constraints, or that they have been calculated previously, and their Dirac brackets generated.[1]","image":"0966b46754ad5e3559b4cfd0f6101506800dff81.svg","url":"First_class_constraint"}
