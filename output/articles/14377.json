{"title":"SimRank","summary":"SimRank is a general similarity measure, based on a simple and intuitive graph-theoretic model. SimRank is applicable in any domain with object-to-object relationships, that measures similarity of the structural context in which objects occur, based on their relationships with other objects. Effectively, SimRank is a measure that says \"two objects are considered to be similar if they are referenced by similar objects.\" Although SimRank is widely adopted, it may output unreasonable similarity scores which are influenced by different factors, and can be solved in several ways, such as introducing an evidence weight factor,[1] inserting additional terms that are neglected by SimRank[2] or using PageRank-based alternatives.[3]","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"SimRank"}
