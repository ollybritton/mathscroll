{"title":"Venn diagram","summary":"A Venn diagram is a widely used diagram style that shows the logical relation between sets, popularized by John Venn (1834â€“1923) in the 1880s. The diagrams are used to teach elementary set theory, and to illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics and computer science. A Venn diagram uses simple closed curves drawn on a plane to represent sets. Very often, these curves are circles or ellipses.","image":"Venn_diagram_gr_la_ru.svg.png.webp","url":"Venn_diagram"}
