{"title":"Projection (linear algebra)","summary":"In linear algebra and functional analysis, a projection is a linear transformation P {\\displaystyle P} from a vector space to itself (an endomorphism) such that P âˆ˜ P = P {\\displaystyle P\\circ P=P} . That is, whenever P {\\displaystyle P} is applied twice to any vector, it gives the same result as if it were applied once (i.e. P {\\displaystyle P} is idempotent). It leaves its image unchanged.[1] This definition of \"projection\" formalizes and generalizes the idea of graphical projection.  One can also consider the effect of a projection on a geometrical object by examining the effect of the projection on points in the object.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Projection_(linear_algebra)"}
