{"title":"Heyting algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Heyting algebra (also known as pseudo-Boolean algebra[1]) is a bounded lattice (with join and meet operations written ∨ and ∧ and with least element 0 and greatest element 1) equipped with a binary operation a → b of implication such that (c ∧ a) ≤ b is equivalent to c ≤ (a → b). From a logical standpoint, A → B is by this definition the weakest proposition for which modus ponens, the inference rule A → B, A ⊢ B, is sound.  Like Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras form a variety axiomatizable with finitely many equations. Heyting algebras were introduced by Arend Heyting (1930) to formalize intuitionistic logic.","image":"bae48a641d4373ace5f2e96c2168aca102c8e968.svg","url":"Heyting_algebra"}
