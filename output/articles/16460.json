{"title":"Upper set","summary":"In mathematics, an upper set (also called an upward closed set, an upset, or an isotone set in X)[1] of a partially ordered set ( X , ≤ ) {\\displaystyle (X,\\leq )} is a subset S ⊆ X {\\displaystyle S\\subseteq X} with the following property: if s is in S and if x in X is larger than s (that is, if s < x {\\displaystyle s<x} ), then x is in S. In other words, this means that any x element of X that is ≥ {\\displaystyle \\,\\geq \\,} to some element of S is necessarily also an element of S. The term lower set (also called a downward closed set, down set, decreasing set, initial segment, or semi-ideal) is defined similarly as being a subset S of X with the property that any element x of X that is ≤ {\\displaystyle \\,\\leq \\,} to some element of S is necessarily also an element of S.","image":"05986ce35d21b64f59206cb040c9c1607dae82b8.svg","url":"Upper_set"}
