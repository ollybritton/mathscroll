{"title":"Parbelos","summary":"The parbelos is a figure similar to the arbelos but instead of three half circles it uses three parabola segments. More precisely the parbelos consists of three parabola segments, that have a height that is one fourth of the width at their bases. The two smaller parabola segments are placed next to each other with their bases on a common line and the largest parabola is placed over the two smaller ones such that its width is the sum of the widths of the smaller ones (see graphic).","image":"Parbelos_sondow_parallelogram.svg.png.webp","url":"Parbelos"}
