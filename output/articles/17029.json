{"title":"Writhe","summary":"In knot theory, there are several competing notions of the quantity writhe, or Wr {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Wr} } . In one sense, it is purely a property of an oriented link diagram and assumes integer values. In another sense, it is a quantity that describes the amount of \"coiling\" of a mathematical knot (or any closed simple curve) in three-dimensional space and assumes real numbers as values. In both cases, writhe is a geometric quantity, meaning that while deforming a curve (or diagram) in such a way that does not change its topology, one may still change its writhe.[1]","image":"ffbb31b63e6daec496157b37514341b00d8fea1b.svg","url":"Writhe"}
