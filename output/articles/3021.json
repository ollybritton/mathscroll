{"title":"Complex multiplication","summary":"In mathematics, complex multiplication (CM) is the theory of elliptic curves E that have an endomorphism ring larger than the integers.[1] Put another way, it contains the theory of elliptic functions with extra symmetries, such as are visible when the period lattice is the Gaussian integer lattice or Eisenstein integer lattice.","image":"Lattice_torsion_points.svg.png.webp","url":"Complex_multiplication"}
