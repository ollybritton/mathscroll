{"title":"Free factor complex","summary":"In mathematics, the free factor complex  (sometimes also called the complex of free factors) is a free group counterpart of the notion of the curve complex of a finite type surface. The free factor complex was originally introduced in a 1998 paper of Allen Hatcher and Karen Vogtmann.[1] Like the curve complex, the free factor complex is known to be Gromov-hyperbolic. The free factor complex plays a significant role in the study of large-scale geometry of Out ‚Å° ( F n ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Out} (F_{n})} .","image":"81dba4eae1be3db3d7b8cc0802bca9a7d17766c5.svg","url":"Free_factor_complex"}
