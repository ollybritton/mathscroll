{"title":"Pierre Remond de Montmort","summary":"Pierre Remond de Montmort was a French mathematician.  He was born in Paris on 27 October 1678 and died there on 7 October 1719. His name was originally just Pierre Remond. His father pressured him to study law, but he rebelled and travelled to England and Germany, returning to France in 1699 when, upon receiving a large inheritance from his father, he bought an estate and took the name de Montmort. He was friendly with several other notable mathematicians, and especially Nicholas Bernoulli, who collaborated with him while visiting his estate. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1715, while traveling again to England, and became a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1716.","image":"Remond_de_Monmort_signature.png.webp","url":"Pierre_Remond_de_Montmort"}
