{"title":"Projection (measure theory)","summary":"In measure theory, projection maps  often appear when working with product (Cartesian) spaces: The product sigma-algebra of measurable spaces is defined to be the finest such that the projection mappings will be measurable. Sometimes for some reasons product spaces are equipped with 𝜎-algebra different than the product 𝜎-algebra. In these cases the projections need not be measurable at all.","image":"4d32174ed47ec74dd5536afc0b6d87860da857d0.svg","url":"Projection_(measure_theory)"}
