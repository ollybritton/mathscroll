{"title":"Expander walk sampling","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the expander walk sampling theorem intuitively states that sampling vertices in an expander graph by doing relatively short random walk can simulate sampling the vertices independently from a uniform distribution. The earliest version of this theorem is due to Ajtai, Komlós & Szemerédi (1987), and the more general version is typically attributed to Gillman (1998).","image":"644a8d85ee410b6159ca2bdb5dcb9097e2c8f182.svg","url":"Expander_walk_sampling"}
