{"title":"Helly family","summary":"In combinatorics, a Helly family of order k is a family of sets in which every minimal subfamily with an empty intersection has k or fewer sets in it. Equivalently, every finite subfamily such that every k-fold intersection is non-empty has non-empty total intersection.[1] The k-Helly property is the property of being a Helly family of order k.[2]","image":"5d60ff9326f87b9e18078832cee6aff971320175.svg","url":"Helly_family"}
