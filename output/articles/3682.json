{"title":"Cycle rank","summary":"In graph theory, the cycle rank of a directed graph is a digraph connectivity measure proposed first by Eggan and BÃ¼chi (Eggan 1963).  Intuitively, this concept measures how close a digraph is to a directed acyclic graph (DAG), in the sense that a DAG has cycle rank zero, while a complete digraph of order n with a self-loop at each vertex has cycle rank n. The cycle rank of a directed graph is closely related to the tree-depth of an undirected graph and to the star height of a regular language. It has also found use in sparse matrix computations (see Bodlaender et al. 1995) and logic (Rossman 2008).","image":"e9e26e3da773cca7e185b8f59a7181c415c2afad.svg","url":"Cycle_rank"}
