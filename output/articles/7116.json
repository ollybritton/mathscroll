{"title":"Hermitian manifold","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in differential geometry, a Hermitian manifold is the complex analogue of a Riemannian manifold. More precisely, a Hermitian manifold is a complex manifold with a smoothly varying Hermitian inner product on each (holomorphic) tangent space. One can also define a Hermitian manifold as a real manifold with a Riemannian metric that preserves a complex structure.","image":"7cf3cf5b79a42c52aabba35d1331ea5d848d232a.svg","url":"Hermitian_manifold"}
