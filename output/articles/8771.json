{"title":"Knot theory","summary":"In the mathematical field of topology, knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. While inspired by knots which appear in daily life, such as those in shoelaces and rope, a mathematical knot differs in that the ends are joined so it cannot be undone, the simplest knot being a ring (or \"unknot\"). In mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} . Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting it or passing it through itself.","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg","url":"Knot_theory"}
