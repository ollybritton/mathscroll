{"title":"Lord's paradox","summary":"In statistics, Lord's paradox raises the issue of when it is appropriate to control for baseline status.  In three papers, Frederic M. Lord gave examples when statisticians could reach different conclusions depending on whether they adjust for pre-existing differences.[1][2][3] Holland & Rubin (1983) use these examples to illustrate how there may be multiple valid descriptive comparisons in the data, but causal conclusions require an underlying (untestable) causal model.[4] Pearl used these examples to illustrate how graphical causal models resolve the issue of when control for baseline status is appropriate.[5][6][7]","image":"ParadoxSketch.jpg.webp","url":"Lord's_paradox"}
