{"title":"Steane code","summary":"The Steane code is a tool in quantum error correction introduced by Andrew Steane in 1996. It is a CSS code (Calderbank-Shor-Steane), using the classical binary  [7,4,3] Hamming code to correct for qubit flip errors (X errors) and the dual of the Hamming code, the [7,3,4] code, to correct for phase flip errors (Z errors). The Steane code encodes one logical qubit in 7 physical qubits and is able to correct arbitrary single qubit errors.","image":"0ac2e36a1a752a33dabda4b7a35e7177d80fa72e.svg","url":"Steane_code"}
