{"title":"Limiting parallel","summary":"In neutral or absolute geometry, and in hyperbolic geometry, there may be many lines parallel to a given line l {\\displaystyle l} through a point P {\\displaystyle P} not on line R {\\displaystyle R} ; however, in the plane, two parallels may be closer to l {\\displaystyle l} than all others (one in each direction of R {\\displaystyle R} ).","image":"829091f745070b9eb97a80244129025440a1cfac.svg","url":"Limiting_parallel"}
