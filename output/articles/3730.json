{"title":"D-module","summary":"In mathematics, a D-module is a module over a ring D of differential operators. The major interest of such D-modules is as an approach to the theory of linear partial differential equations. Since around 1970, D-module theory has been built up, mainly as a response to the ideas of Mikio Sato on algebraic analysis, and expanding on the work of Sato and Joseph Bernstein on the Bernsteinâ€“Sato polynomial.","image":"397d4b4f490bf4a45b71a82c3e452d3eb1063be4.svg","url":"D-module"}
