{"title":"Solovay–Strassen primality test","summary":"The Solovay–Strassen primality test, developed by Robert M. Solovay and Volker Strassen in 1977, is a probabilistic test to determine if a number is composite or probably prime. The idea behind the test was discovered by M. M. Artjuhov in 1967[1] (see Theorem E in the paper). This test has been largely superseded by the Baillie–PSW primality test and the Miller–Rabin primality test, but has great historical importance in showing the practical feasibility of the RSA cryptosystem. The Solovay–Strassen test is essentially an Euler–Jacobi probable prime test.","image":"68dc6edb4f9567102038625c8e46c4e4fcf989e6.svg","url":"Solovay–Strassen_primality_test"}
