{"title":"Centralizer and normalizer","summary":"In mathematics, especially group theory, the centralizer  (also called commutant[1][2]) of a subset S in a group G is the set C G ⁡ ( S ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {C} _{G}(S)} of elements of G that commute with every element of S, or equivalently, such that conjugation by g {\\displaystyle g} leaves each element of S fixed. The normalizer of S in G is the set of elements N G ( S ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {N} _{G}(S)} of G that satisfy the weaker condition of leaving the set S ⊆ G {\\displaystyle S\\subseteq G} fixed under conjugation. The centralizer and normalizer of S are subgroups of G.  Many techniques in group theory are based on studying the centralizers and normalizers of suitable subsets S.","image":"3d1393944316fe9f3c48bcc86d35f26bd5549412.svg","url":"Centralizer_and_normalizer"}
