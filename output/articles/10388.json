{"title":"Meyerhoff manifold","summary":"In hyperbolic geometry, the Meyerhoff manifold is the arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold obtained by ( 5 , 1 ) {\\displaystyle (5,1)} surgery on the figure-8 knot complement.  It was introduced by Robert MeyerhoffÂ (1987) as a possible candidate for the hyperbolic 3-manifold of smallest volume, but the Weeks manifold turned out to have  slightly smaller volume. It has  the second smallest volume","image":"170f2fa98ae979d684bcc5848127a2ea31eb82b3.svg","url":"Meyerhoff_manifold"}
