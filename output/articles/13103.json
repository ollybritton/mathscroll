{"title":"Randomized algorithm","summary":"A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic or procedure. The algorithm typically uses uniformly random bits as an auxiliary input to guide its behavior, in the hope of achieving good performance in the \"average case\" over all possible choices of random determined by the random bits; thus either the running time, or the output (or both) are random variables.","image":"28b23b9a9c100091938f875a021b7691086adeec.svg","url":"Randomized_algorithm"}
