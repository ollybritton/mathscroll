{"title":"Probability space","summary":"In probability theory, a probability space or a probability triple ( Î© , F , P ) {\\displaystyle (\\Omega ,{\\mathcal {F}},P)} is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random process or \"experiment\". For example, one can define a probability space which models the throwing of a die.","image":"9d77104a5c3c49cc0634dcf6908db7ad45f738d2.svg","url":"Probability_space"}
