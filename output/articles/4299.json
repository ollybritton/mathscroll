{"title":"Distance correlation","summary":"In statistics and in probability theory, distance correlation or distance covariance is a measure of dependence between two paired random vectors of arbitrary, not necessarily equal, dimension. The population distance correlation coefficient is zero if and only if the random vectors are independent.  Thus, distance correlation measures both linear and nonlinear association between two random variables or random vectors.  This is in contrast to Pearson's correlation, which can only detect linear association between two random variables.","image":"Distance_Correlation_Examples.svg.png.webp","url":"Distance_correlation"}
