{"title":"Jacobi field","summary":"In Riemannian geometry, a Jacobi field is a vector field along a geodesic Î³ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } in a Riemannian manifold describing the difference between the geodesic and an \"infinitesimally close\" geodesic. In other words, the Jacobi fields along a geodesic form the tangent space to the geodesic in the space of all geodesics. They are named after Carl Jacobi.","image":"a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a.svg","url":"Jacobi_field"}
