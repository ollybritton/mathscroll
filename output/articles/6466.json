{"title":"Graph embedding","summary":"In topological graph theory, an embedding (also spelled imbedding) of a graph G {\\displaystyle G} on a surface Σ {\\displaystyle \\Sigma } is a representation of G {\\displaystyle G} on Σ {\\displaystyle \\Sigma } in which points of Σ {\\displaystyle \\Sigma } are associated with vertices and simple arcs (homeomorphic images of [ 0 , 1 ] {\\displaystyle [0,1]} ) are associated with edges in such a way that:","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Graph_embedding"}
