{"title":"Cyclic homology","summary":"In noncommutative geometry and related branches of mathematics, cyclic homology and cyclic cohomology are certain (co)homology theories for associative algebras which generalize the de Rham (co)homology of manifolds.  These notions were independently introduced by Boris Tsygan (homology)[1] and Alain Connes (cohomology)[2] in the 1980s. These invariants have many interesting relationships with several older branches of mathematics, including de Rham theory, Hochschild (co)homology, group cohomology, and the K-theory.  Contributors to the development of the theory include Max Karoubi, Yuri L. Daletskii, Boris Feigin, Jean-Luc Brylinski, Mariusz Wodzicki, Jean-Louis Loday, Victor Nistor, Daniel Quillen, Joachim Cuntz, Ryszard Nest, Ralf Meyer, and Michael Puschnigg.","image":"271566db7e8ca8616a4dc3efb6c5982a2d987ee3.svg","url":"Cyclic_homology"}
