{"title":"Three utilities problem","summary":"The classical mathematical puzzle known as the three utilities problem or sometimes water, gas and electricity asks for non-crossing connections to be drawn between three houses and three utility companies in the plane. When posing it in the early 20th century, Henry Dudeney wrote that it was already an old problem. It is an impossible puzzle: it is not possible to connect all nine lines without crossing. Versions of the problem on nonplanar surfaces such as a torus or MÃ¶bius strip, or that allow connections to pass through other houses or utilities, can be solved.","image":"3_utilities_problem_plane.svg.png.webp","url":"Three_utilities_problem"}
