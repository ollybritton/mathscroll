{"title":"Karoubi envelope","summary":"In mathematics the Karoubi envelope (or Cauchy completion or idempotent completion) of a category C is a classification of the idempotents of C, by means of an auxiliary category. Taking the Karoubi envelope of a preadditive category gives a pseudo-abelian category, hence the construction is sometimes called the pseudo-abelian completion. It is named for the French mathematician Max Karoubi.","image":"08c1a93e36da8149cc887fccf94e21a82f58508b.svg","url":"Karoubi_envelope"}
