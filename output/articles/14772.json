{"title":"Sphere eversion","summary":"In differential topology, sphere eversion is the process of turning a sphere inside out in a three-dimensional space (the word eversion means \"turning inside out\"). Remarkably, it is possible to smoothly and continuously turn a sphere inside out in this way (allowing self-intersections of the sphere's surface) without cutting or tearing it or creating any crease. This is surprising, both to non-mathematicians and to those who understand regular homotopy, and can be regarded as a veridical paradox; that is something that, while being true, on first glance seems false.","image":"MorinSurfaceFromTheTop.PNG.webp","url":"Sphere_eversion"}
