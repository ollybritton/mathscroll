{"title":"Augmented sphenocorona","summary":"In geometry, the augmented sphenocorona is one of the Johnson solids (J87), and is obtained by adding a square pyramid to one of the square faces of the sphenocorona. It is the only Johnson solid arising from \"cut and paste\" manipulations where the components are not all prisms, antiprisms or sections of Platonic or Archimedean solids.","image":"Augmented_sphenocorona.png.webp","url":"Augmented_sphenocorona"}
