{"title":"Euler–Maclaurin formula","summary":"In mathematics, the Euler–Maclaurin formula is a formula for the difference between an integral and a closely related sum.  It can be used to approximate integrals by finite sums, or conversely to evaluate finite sums and infinite series using integrals and the machinery of calculus. For example, many asymptotic expansions are derived from the formula, and Faulhaber's formula for the sum of powers is an immediate consequence.","image":"e141c457f8f6be4e46dd83587301e84a9f6a65a9.svg","url":"Euler–Maclaurin_formula"}
