{"title":"Atiyah–Singer index theorem","summary":"In differential geometry, the Atiyah–Singer index theorem, proved by Michael Atiyah and Isadore Singer (1963),[1] states that for an elliptic differential operator on a compact manifold, the analytical index (related to the dimension of the space of solutions) is equal to the topological index (defined in terms of some topological data).  It includes many other theorems, such as the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem and Riemann–Roch theorem, as special cases, and has applications to theoretical physics.[2][3]","image":"49099bbc969b384b05477fd616862198234d9d5c.svg","url":"Atiyah–Singer_index_theorem"}
