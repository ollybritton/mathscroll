{"title":"q-Gaussian process","summary":"q-Gaussian processes are deformations of the usual Gaussian distribution. There are several different versions of this; here we treat a multivariate deformation, also addressed as q-Gaussian process, arising from free probability theory and corresponding to deformations of the canonical commutation relations. For other deformations of Gaussian distributions, see q-Gaussian distribution and Gaussian q-distribution.","image":"2384bf877e98c3832fc3a96bce97693268dfe33f.svg","url":"Q-Gaussian_process"}
