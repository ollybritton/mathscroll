{"title":"Visual calculus","summary":"Visual calculus, invented by Mamikon Mnatsakanian (known as Mamikon), is an approach to solving a variety of integral calculus problems.[1] Many problems that would otherwise seem quite difficult yield to the method with hardly a line of calculation, often reminiscent of what Martin Gardner called \"aha! solutions\" or Roger Nelsen a proof without words.[2][3]","image":"Mamikons_Theorem.svg.png.webp","url":"Visual_calculus"}
