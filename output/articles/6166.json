{"title":"Geometrical properties of polynomial roots","summary":"In mathematics, a univariate polynomial of degree n with real or complex coefficients has n complex roots, if counted with their multiplicities. They form a multiset of n points in the complex plane. This article concerns the geometry of these points, that is the information about their localization in the complex plane that can be deduced from the degree and the coefficients of the polynomial.","image":"88977e82a67819a7b5609c57d993d8941d1007f8.svg","url":"Geometrical_properties_of_polynomial_roots"}
