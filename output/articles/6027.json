{"title":"Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction","summary":"In functional analysis, a discipline within mathematics, given a C*-algebra A,  the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction establishes a correspondence between cyclic *-representations of A and certain linear functionals on A (called states).  The correspondence is shown by an explicit construction of the *-representation from the state. It is named for Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark, and Irving Segal.","image":"9c8a0579fa28a5761fc26174a2965d5992e2fd67.svg","url":"Gelfand–Naimark–Segal_construction"}
