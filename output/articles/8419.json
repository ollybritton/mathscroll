{"title":"Jordan–Chevalley decomposition","summary":"In mathematics, the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition, named after Camille Jordan and Claude Chevalley, expresses a linear operator as the sum of its commuting semisimple part and its nilpotent part. The multiplicative decomposition expresses an invertible operator as the product of its commuting semisimple and unipotent parts. The decomposition is easy to describe when the Jordan normal form of the operator is given, but it exists under weaker hypotheses than the existence of a Jordan normal form. Analogues of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition exist for elements of linear algebraic groups, Lie algebras, and Lie groups, and the decomposition is an important tool in the study of these objects.","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Jordan–Chevalley_decomposition"}
