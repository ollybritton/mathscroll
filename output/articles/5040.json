{"title":"Euclidean rhythm","summary":"The Euclidean rhythm in music was discovered by Godfried Toussaint in 2004 and is described in a 2005 paper \"The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms\".[1] The greatest common divisor of two numbers is used rhythmically giving the number of beats and silences, generating almost all of the most important world music rhythms,[2] except Indian.[3] The beats in the resulting rhythms are as equidistant as possible; the same results can be obtained from the Bresenham algorithm.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Euclidean_rhythm"}
