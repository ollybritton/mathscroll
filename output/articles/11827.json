{"title":"Parthasarathy's theorem","summary":"In mathematics – and in particular the study of games on the unit square – Parthasarathy's theorem is a generalization of Von Neumann's minimax theorem.  It states that a particular class of games has a mixed value, provided that at least one of the players has a strategy that is restricted to absolutely continuous distributions with respect to the Lebesgue measure (in other words, one of the players is forbidden to use a pure strategy).","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Parthasarathy's_theorem"}
