{"title":"Donegall Lectureship at Trinity College Dublin","summary":"The Donegall Lecturership at Trinity College Dublin, is one of two endowed mathematics positions at Trinity College Dublin (TCD), the other being the Erasmus Smith's Chair of Mathematics. The Donegall (sometimes spelt Donegal) Lectureship was endowed in 1668 by The 3rd Earl of Donegall.[1][2] In 1675, after the restoration, it was combined with the previous public Professor in Mathematics position that had been created in 1652 by the Commonwealth parliament. For much of its history, the Donegall Lectureship was awarded to a mathematician as an additional honour which came with a supplementary income.[3] Since 1967, the lectureship has been awarded to a leading international scientist who visits the Department of Pure and Applied Mathematics and gives talks, including a public lecture called the Donegall Lecture.","image":"3rdEarlOfDonnegall.jpg.webp","url":"Donegall_Lectureship_at_Trinity_College_Dublin"}
