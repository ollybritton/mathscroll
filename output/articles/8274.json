{"title":"Jeffery–Hamel flow","summary":"In fluid dynamics Jeffery–Hamel flow is a flow created by a converging or diverging channel with a source or sink of fluid volume at the point of intersection of the two plane walls. It is named after George Barker Jeffery(1915)[1] and Georg Hamel(1917),[2] but it has subsequently been studied by many major scientists such as von Kármán and Levi-Civita,[3] Walter Tollmien,[4] F. Noether,[5] W.R. Dean,[6] Rosenhead,[7] Landau,[8] G.K. Batchelor[9] etc. A complete set of solutions was described by Edward Fraenkel in 1962.[10]","image":"8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed.svg","url":"Jeffery–Hamel_flow"}
