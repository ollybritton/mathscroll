{"title":"Hurwitz's theorem (composition algebras)","summary":"In mathematics, Hurwitz's theorem is a theorem of Adolf Hurwitz (1859â€“1919), published posthumously in 1923, solving the Hurwitz problem for finite-dimensional unital real non-associative algebras endowed with a positive-definite quadratic form. The theorem states that if the quadratic form defines a homomorphism into the positive real numbers on the non-zero part of the algebra, then the algebra must be isomorphic to the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, or the octonions. Such algebras, sometimes called Hurwitz algebras, are examples of composition algebras.","image":"d7daed4d1214591e626558ef32a5cb7ea8d36015.svg","url":"Hurwitz's_theorem_(composition_algebras)"}
