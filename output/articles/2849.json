{"title":"Cohn's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Cohn's theorem[1] states that a nth-degree self-inversive polynomial p ( z ) {\\displaystyle p(z)} has as many roots in the open unit disk D = { z ∈ C : | z | < 1 } {\\displaystyle D=\\{z\\in \\mathbb {C} :|z|<1\\}} as the reciprocal polynomial of its derivative.[1][2][3] Cohn's theorem is useful for studying the distribution of the roots of self-inversive and self-reciprocal polynomials in the complex plane.[4][5]","image":"601d64b4ef16c5669c6c083c2998e53a6ec9c9d1.svg","url":"Cohn's_theorem"}
