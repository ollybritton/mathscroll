{"title":"Orbital stability","summary":"In mathematical physics and the theory of partial differential equations, the solitary wave solution of the form u ( x , t ) = e − i ω t ϕ ( x ) {\\displaystyle u(x,t)=e^{-i\\omega t}\\phi (x)} is said to be orbitally stable if any solution with the initial data sufficiently close to ϕ ( x ) {\\displaystyle \\phi (x)} forever remains in a given small neighborhood of the trajectory of e − i ω t ϕ ( x ) . {\\displaystyle e^{-i\\omega t}\\phi (x).}","image":"8cd1d81fd09dffbfa5bad636efbee28cf3510320.svg","url":"Orbital_stability"}
