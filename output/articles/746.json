{"title":"Analytic manifold","summary":"In mathematics, an analytic manifold, also known as a C Ï‰ {\\displaystyle C^{\\omega }} manifold, is a differentiable manifold with analytic transition maps.[1] The term usually refers to real analytic manifolds, although complex manifolds are also analytic.[2] In algebraic geometry, analytic spaces are a generalization of analytic manifolds such that singularities are permitted.","image":"38d37d5006f57a93d8c29b58421c2cb8f5473ad8.svg","url":"Analytic_manifold"}
