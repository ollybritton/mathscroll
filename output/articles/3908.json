{"title":"Dehn plane","summary":"In geometry, Max Dehn introduced two examples of planes, a semi-Euclidean geometry and a non-Legendrian geometry, that have infinitely many lines parallel to a given one that pass through a given point, but where the sum of the angles of a triangle is at least π.  A similar phenomenon occurs in hyperbolic geometry, except that the sum of the angles of a triangle is less than π.   Dehn's examples use a non-Archimedean field, so that the Archimedean axiom is violated.  They were introduced by Max Dehn (1900) and discussed by Hilbert (1902, pp. 127–130, or pp. 42–43 in some later editions).","image":"c8c35fa07aa0e24e20e21119a4bb135618a35019.svg","url":"Dehn_plane"}
