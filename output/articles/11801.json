{"title":"Parametrization (geometry)","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in geometry, parametrization (or parameterization; also parameterisation, parametrisation) is the process of finding parametric equations of a curve, a surface, or, more generally, a manifold or a variety, defined by an implicit equation. The inverse process is called implicitization.[1]  \"To parameterize\" by itself means \"to express in terms of parameters\".[2]","image":"141c2293139f9e10eaaf7cf3de438dcd1495ea97.svg","url":"Parametrization_(geometry)"}
