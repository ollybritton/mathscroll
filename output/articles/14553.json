{"title":"Small icosacronic hexecontahedron","summary":"In geometry, the small icosacronic hexecontahedron (or small lanceal trisicosahedron) is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron. It is the dual of the uniform small icosicosidodecahedron. Its faces are kites. Part of each kite lies inside the solid, hence is invisible in solid models.","image":"DU31_small_icosacronic_hexecontahedron.png.webp","url":"Small_icosacronic_hexecontahedron"}
