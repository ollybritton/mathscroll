{"title":"Semisimple operator","summary":"In mathematics, a linear operator T on a vector space is semisimple if every T-invariant subspace has a  complementary T-invariant subspace;[1] in other words, the vector space is a semisimple representation of the operator T. Equivalently, a linear operator is semisimple if the minimal polynomial of it is a product of distinct irreducible polynomials.[2]","image":"47430dbd7277982247a9f4717f001e0dd741a439.svg","url":"Semisimple_operator"}
