{"title":"Homeomorphism (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, two graphs G {\\displaystyle G} and G ′ {\\displaystyle G'} are homeomorphic if there is a graph isomorphism from some subdivision of G {\\displaystyle G} to some subdivision of G ′ {\\displaystyle G'} .  If the edges of a graph are thought of as lines drawn from one vertex to another (as they are usually depicted in illustrations), then two graphs are homeomorphic to each other in the graph-theoretic sense precisely if they are homeomorphic in the topological sense.[1]","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Homeomorphism_(graph_theory)"}
