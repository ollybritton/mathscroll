{"title":"Quaternion group","summary":"In group theory,  the quaternion group Q8 (sometimes just denoted by Q) is a non-abelian group of order eight, isomorphic to the eight-element subset { 1 , i , j , k , − 1 , − i , − j , − k } {\\displaystyle \\{1,i,j,k,-1,-i,-j,-k\\}} of the quaternions under multiplication. It is given by the group presentation","image":"19e7ce4eb219f9cb336167b0180587d7132b1931.svg","url":"Quaternion_group"}
