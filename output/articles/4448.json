{"title":"Double layer potential","summary":"In potential theory, an area of mathematics, a double layer potential is a solution of Laplace's equation corresponding to the electrostatic or magnetic potential associated to a dipole distribution on a closed surface S in three-dimensions.  Thus a double layer potential u(x) is a scalar-valued function of x âˆˆ R3 given by","image":"760d3b74c769c5e03a84b2c3e4fdae077e888b19.svg","url":"Double_layer_potential"}
