{"title":"Support (measure theory)","summary":"In mathematics, the support (sometimes topological support or spectrum) of a measure μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } on a measurable topological space ( X , Borel ⁡ ( X ) ) {\\displaystyle (X,\\operatorname {Borel} (X))} is a precise notion of where in the space X {\\displaystyle X} the measure \"lives\". It is defined to be the largest (closed) subset of X {\\displaystyle X} for which every open neighbourhood of every point of the set has positive measure.","image":"9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161.svg","url":"Support_(measure_theory)"}
