{"title":"Kirchberger's theorem","summary":"Kirchberger's theorem is a theorem in discrete geometry, on linear separability. The two-dimensional version of the theorem states that, if a finite set of red and blue points in the Euclidean plane has the property that, for every four points, there exists a line separating the red and blue points within those four, then there exists a single line separating all the red points from all the blue points. Donald Watson phrases this result more colorfully, with a farmyard analogy:","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Kirchberger's_theorem"}
