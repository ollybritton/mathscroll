{"title":"Loop-erased random walk","summary":"In mathematics, loop-erased random walk is a model for a random simple path with important applications in combinatorics, physics and quantum field theory. It is intimately connected to the uniform spanning tree, a model for a random tree. See also random walk for more general treatment of this topic.","image":"a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a.svg","url":"Loop-erased_random_walk"}
