{"title":"Normal eigenvalue","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in spectral theory, an eigenvalue of a closed linear operator is called normal if the space admits a decomposition into a direct sum of a finite-dimensional generalized eigenspace and an invariant subspace where A − λ I {\\displaystyle A-\\lambda I} has a bounded inverse. The set of normal eigenvalues coincides with the discrete spectrum.","image":"2ba67e098a60d3285b10f2e76be219fc3c52d690.svg","url":"Normal_eigenvalue"}
