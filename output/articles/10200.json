{"title":"Maximal and minimal elements","summary":"In mathematics, especially in order theory, a maximal element of a subset S of some preordered set is an element of S that is not smaller than any other element in S. A minimal element of a subset S of some preordered set is defined dually as an element of S that is not greater than any other element in S.","image":"Lattice_of_the_divisibility_of_60_narrow_1%2C2%2C3%2C4.svg.png.webp","url":"Maximal_and_minimal_elements"}
