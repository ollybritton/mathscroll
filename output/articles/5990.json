{"title":"Gaussian integer","summary":"In number theory, a Gaussian integer is a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are both integers. The Gaussian integers, with ordinary addition and multiplication of complex numbers, form an integral domain, usually written as Z [ i ] {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {Z} [i]} or Z [ i ] . {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} [i].} [1]","image":"d0a617cf5867f951fefb72f3ab7278e0f6f1eedd.svg","url":"Gaussian_integer"}
