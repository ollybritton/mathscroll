{"title":"Padé approximant","summary":"In mathematics, a Padé approximant is the \"best\" approximation of a function near a specific point by a rational function of given order. Under this technique, the approximant's power series agrees with the power series of the function it is approximating.  The technique was developed around 1890 by Henri Padé, but goes back to Georg Frobenius, who introduced the idea and investigated the features of rational approximations of power series.","image":"Henri_Padé.jpeg.webp","url":"Padé_approximant"}
