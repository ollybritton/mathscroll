{"title":"Metaplectic group","summary":"In mathematics, the metaplectic group Mp2n is a double cover of the symplectic group Sp2n. It can be defined over either real or p-adic numbers. The construction covers more generally the case of an arbitrary local or finite field, and even the ring of adeles.","image":"d26cff183c56d63a47ccc541fad0a9534f3a8eaa.svg","url":"Metaplectic_group"}
