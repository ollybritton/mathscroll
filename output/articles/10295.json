{"title":"Mehler–Heine formula","summary":"In mathematics, the Mehler–Heine formula introduced by Gustav Ferdinand Mehler[1] and Eduard Heine[2] describes the asymptotic behavior of the Legendre polynomials  as the index tends to infinity, near the edges of the support of the weight. There are generalizations to other classical orthogonal polynomials, which are also called the Mehler–Heine formula. The formula complements the Darboux formulae which describe the asymptotics in the interior and outside the support.","image":"556e46ac969886728ea403070c74b3125070f780.svg","url":"Mehler–Heine_formula"}
