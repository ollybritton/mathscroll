{"title":"Reproducing kernel Hilbert space","summary":"In functional analysis (a branch of mathematics), a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is a Hilbert space of functions in which point evaluation is a continuous linear functional. Roughly speaking, this means that if two functions f {\\displaystyle f} and g {\\displaystyle g} in the RKHS are close in norm, i.e., ‖ f − g ‖ {\\displaystyle \\|f-g\\|} is small, then f {\\displaystyle f} and g {\\displaystyle g} are also pointwise close, i.e., | f ( x ) − g ( x ) | {\\displaystyle |f(x)-g(x)|} is small for all x {\\displaystyle x} . The converse does not need to be true. Informally, this can be shown by looking at the supremum norm: the sequence of functions sin n ⁡ ( x ) {\\displaystyle \\sin ^{n}(x)} converges pointwise, but do not converge uniformly i.e. do not converge with respect to the supremum norm (this is not a counterexample because the supremum norm does not arise from any inner product due to not satisfying the parallelogram law).","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space"}
