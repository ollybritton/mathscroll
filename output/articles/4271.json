{"title":"Discriminant","summary":"In mathematics, the discriminant of a polynomial is a quantity that depends on the coefficients and allows deducing some properties of the roots without computing them. More precisely, it is a polynomial function of the coefficients of the original polynomial. The discriminant is widely used in polynomial factoring, number theory, and algebraic geometry.","image":"126c6935d3dd9f1c1da0c388ca2799be4f6f237c.svg","url":"Discriminant"}
