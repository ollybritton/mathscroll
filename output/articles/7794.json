{"title":"Information flow (information theory)","summary":"Information flow in an information theoretical context is the transfer of information from a variable x {\\displaystyle x} to a variable y {\\displaystyle y} in a given process. Not all flows may be desirable; for example, a system should not leak any confidential information (partially or not) to public observers--as it is a violation of privacy on an individual level, or might cause major loss on a corporate level.","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Information_flow_(information_theory)"}
