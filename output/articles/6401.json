{"title":"Gowers norm","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of additive combinatorics, a Gowers norm or uniformity norm is a class of norms on functions on a finite group or group-like object which quantify the amount of structure present, or conversely, the amount of randomness.[1] They are used in the study of arithmetic progressions in the group.  They are named after Timothy Gowers, who introduced it in his work on Szemer√©di's theorem.[2]","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Gowers_norm"}
