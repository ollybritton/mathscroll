{"title":"Characteristic (algebra)","summary":"In mathematics, the characteristic of a ring R, often denoted char(R), is defined to be the smallest number of times one must use the ring's multiplicative identity (1) in a sum to get the additive identity (0). If this sum never reaches the additive identity the ring is said to have characteristic zero.","image":"2e136ed752a466afae824785520b035a2006267d.svg","url":"Characteristic_(algebra)"}
