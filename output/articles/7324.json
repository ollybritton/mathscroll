{"title":"Hodge theory","summary":"In mathematics, Hodge theory, named after W. V. D. Hodge, is a method for studying the cohomology groups of a smooth manifold M using partial differential equations.  The key observation is that, given a Riemannian metric on M, every cohomology class has a canonical representative, a differential form that vanishes under the Laplacian operator of the metric.  Such forms are called harmonic.","image":"b003cb7ccf7b5cd576acf2fe67a27f6640fc187a.svg","url":"Hodge_theory"}
