{"title":"Riffle shuffle permutation","summary":"In the mathematics of permutations and the study of shuffling playing cards, a riffle shuffle permutation is one of the permutations of a set of n {\\displaystyle n} items that can be obtained by a single riffle shuffle, in which a sorted deck of n {\\displaystyle n} cards is cut into two packets and then the two packets are interleaved (e.g. by moving cards one at a time from the bottom of one or the other of the packets to the top of the sorted deck). Beginning with an ordered set (1 rising sequence), mathematically a riffle shuffle is defined as a permutation on this set containing 1 or 2 rising sequences.[1] The permutations with 1 rising sequence are the identity permutations.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Riffle_shuffle_permutation"}
