{"title":"Spin connection","summary":"In differential geometry and mathematical physics, a spin connection is a connection on a spinor bundle.  It is induced, in a canonical manner, from the affine connection.  It can also be regarded as the gauge field generated by local Lorentz transformations. In some canonical formulations of general relativity, a spin connection is defined on spatial slices and can also be regarded as the gauge field generated by local rotations.","image":"89b59fc4f675953840fa9cb49384bc9a6229eb3a.svg","url":"Spin_connection"}
