{"title":"Multinomial logistic regression","summary":"In statistics, multinomial logistic regression is a classification method that generalizes logistic regression to multiclass problems, i.e. with more than two possible discrete outcomes.[1]  That is, it is a model that is used to predict the probabilities of the different possible outcomes of a categorically distributed dependent variable, given a set of independent variables (which may be real-valued, binary-valued, categorical-valued, etc.).","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Multinomial_logistic_regression"}
