{"title":"Kadison–Kastler metric","summary":"In mathematics, the Kadison–Kastler metric is a metric on the space of C*-algebras on a fixed Hilbert space. It is the Hausdorff distance between the unit balls of the two C*-algebras, under the norm-induced metric on the space of all bounded operators on that Hilbert space.","image":"19ef4c7b923a5125ac91aa491838a95ee15b804f.svg","url":"Kadison–Kastler_metric"}
