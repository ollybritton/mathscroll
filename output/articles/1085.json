{"title":"Associative magic square","summary":"An associative magic square is a magic square for which each pair of numbers symmetrically opposite to the center sum up to the same value. For an n × n square, filled with the numbers from 1 to n2, this common sum must equal n2 + 1. These squares are also called associated magic squares, regular magic squares, regmagic squares, or symmetric magic squares.[1][2][3]","image":"Magic_Square_Lo_Shu.svg.png.webp","url":"Associative_magic_square"}
