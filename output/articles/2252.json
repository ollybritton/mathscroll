{"title":"Carlson's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, in the area of complex analysis, Carlson's theorem is a uniqueness theorem which was discovered by Fritz David Carlson. Informally, it states that two different analytic functions which do not grow very fast at infinity can not coincide at the integers. The theorem may be obtained from the Phragmén–Lindelöf theorem, which is itself an extension of the maximum-modulus theorem.","image":"dcdb556c79fdc57cf2eb00182633105160275b50.svg","url":"Carlson's_theorem"}
