{"title":"Simple group","summary":"In mathematics, a simple group is a nontrivial group whose only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself.  A group that is not simple can be broken into two smaller groups, namely a nontrivial normal subgroup and the corresponding quotient group. This process can be repeated, and for finite groups one eventually arrives at uniquely determined simple groups, by the Jordan–Hölder theorem.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Simple_group"}
