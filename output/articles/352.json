{"title":"Adapted process","summary":"In the study of stochastic processes, an adapted process (also referred to as a non-anticipating or non-anticipative process) is one that cannot \"see into the future\". An informal interpretation[1] is that X is adapted if and only if, for every realisation and every n, Xn is known at time n. The concept of an adapted process is essential, for instance, in the definition of the It≈ç integral, which only makes sense if the integrand is an adapted process.","image":"6bb8743f7565082ed1a9ee0490d9d71be82eafaa.svg","url":"Adapted_process"}
