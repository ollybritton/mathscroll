{"title":"Binary cyclic group","summary":"In mathematics, the binary cyclic group of the n-gon is the cyclic group of order 2n, C 2 n {\\displaystyle C_{2n}} , thought of as an extension of the cyclic group C n {\\displaystyle C_{n}} by a cyclic group of order 2. Coxeter writes the binary cyclic group with angle-brackets, ⟨n⟩, and the index 2 subgroup as (n) or [n]+.","image":"5330af1c0fcf3c3f18acd843e7503f9a5f6c3cc1.svg","url":"Binary_cyclic_group"}
