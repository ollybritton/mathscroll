{"title":"Green measure","summary":"In mathematics — specifically, in stochastic analysis — the Green measure is a measure associated to an Itō diffusion.  There is an associated Green formula representing suitably smooth functions in terms of the Green measure and first exit times of the diffusion.  The concepts are named after the British mathematician George Green and are generalizations of the classical Green's function and Green formula to the stochastic case using Dynkin's formula.","image":"74020ebdc5f13fe26d2889fb82a61b3077db5677.svg","url":"Green_measure"}
