{"title":"Martingale difference sequence","summary":"In probability theory, a martingale difference sequence (MDS) is related to the concept of the martingale.  A stochastic series X is an MDS if its expectation with respect to the past is zero. Formally, consider an adapted sequence { X t , F t } − ∞ ∞ {\\displaystyle \\{X_{t},{\\mathcal {F}}_{t}\\}_{-\\infty }^{\\infty }} on a probability space ( Ω , F , P ) {\\displaystyle (\\Omega ,{\\mathcal {F}},\\mathbb {P} )} . X t {\\displaystyle X_{t}} is an MDS if it satisfies the following two conditions:","image":"d7eec32c50708b2e8be3ccc6d4b9bb72c847235f.svg","url":"Martingale_difference_sequence"}
