{"title":"Conjunctive normal form","summary":"In Boolean logic, a formula is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) or clausal normal form if it is a conjunction of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of literals; otherwise put, it is a product of sums or an AND of ORs. As a canonical normal form, it is useful in automated theorem proving and circuit theory.","image":"ba36bd551ed927c12a64f1c0b24f16e0c7fb3d7e.svg","url":"Conjunctive_normal_form"}
