{"title":"Automatic semigroup","summary":"In mathematics, an automatic semigroup is a finitely generated semigroup equipped with several regular languages over an alphabet representing a generating set. One of these languages determines \"canonical forms\" for the elements of the semigroup, the other languages determine if two canonical forms represent elements that differ by multiplication by a generator.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Automatic_semigroup"}
