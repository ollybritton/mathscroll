{"title":"Whitney's planarity criterion","summary":"In mathematics, Whitney's planarity criterion is a matroid-theoretic characterization of planar graphs, named after Hassler Whitney.[1] It states that a graph G is planar if and only if its graphic matroid is also cographic (that is, it is the dual matroid of another graphic matroid).","image":"Duals_graphs.svg.png.webp","url":"Whitney's_planarity_criterion"}
