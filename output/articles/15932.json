{"title":"Trace class","summary":"In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, a trace-class operator is a linear operator for which a trace may be defined, such that the trace is a finite number independent of the choice of basis used to compute the trace. This trace of trace-class operators generalizes the trace of matrices studied in linear algebra. All trace-class operators are compact operators.","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Trace_class"}
