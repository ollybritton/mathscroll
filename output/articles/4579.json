{"title":"e (mathematical constant)","summary":"The number e, also known as Euler's number, is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828 that can be characterized in many ways. It is the base of natural logarithms. It is the limit of (1 + 1/n)n as n approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite series","image":"2f9a1f86072b07e1f69d5e21571c207d52680d8f.svg","url":"E_(mathematical_constant)"}
