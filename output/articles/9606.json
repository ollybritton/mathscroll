{"title":"Local flatness","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, local flatness is smoothness condition that can be imposed on topological submanifolds.   In the category of topological manifolds, locally flat submanifolds play a role similar to that of embedded submanifolds in the category of smooth manifolds. Violations of local flatness describe ridge networks and crumpled structures, with applications to materials processing and mechanical engineering.","image":"e3c8d7fd864ef9386a936b3bf5ea31b82c595bb0.svg","url":"Local_flatness"}
