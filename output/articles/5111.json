{"title":"Eventually (mathematics)","summary":"In the mathematical areas of number theory and analysis, an infinite sequence or a function is said to eventually have a certain property, if it doesn't have the said property across all its ordered instances, but will after some instances have passed. The use of the term \"eventually\" can be often rephrased as \"for sufficiently large numbers\",[1] and can be also extended to the class of properties that apply to elements of any ordered set (such as sequences and subsets of R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } ).","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Eventually_(mathematics)"}
