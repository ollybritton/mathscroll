{"title":"Parametric equation","summary":"In mathematics, a parametric equation defines a group of quantities as functions of one or more independent variables called parameters.[1] Parametric equations are commonly used to express the coordinates of the points that make up a geometric object such as a curve or surface, called  parametric curve and parametric surface, respectively. In such cases, the equations are collectively called a parametric representation,[2] or parametric system,[3] or parameterization (alternatively spelled as parametrisation) of the object.[1][4][5]","image":"Butterfly_transcendental_curve.svg.png.webp","url":"Parametric_equation"}
