{"title":"Davenport constant","summary":"In mathematics, the Davenport constant D(G ) is an invariant of a group studied in additive combinatorics, quantifying the size of nonunique factorizations.  Given a finite abelian group G, D(G ) is defined as the smallest number such that every sequence of elements of that length contains a non-empty subsequence adding up to 0.  In symbols, this is[1]","image":"5c43d3047e83dc7583460c62cb4a5a029a1cc6e5.svg","url":"Davenport_constant"}
