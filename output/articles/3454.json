{"title":"Corollary","summary":"In mathematics and logic, a corollary (/ˈkɒrəˌlɛri/ KORR-ə-lerr-ee, UK: /kɒˈrɒləri/ korr-OL-ər-ee) is a theorem of less importance which can be readily deduced from a previous, more notable statement. A corollary could, for instance, be a proposition which is incidentally proved while proving another proposition;[1] it might also be used more casually to refer to something which naturally or incidentally accompanies something else (e.g., violence as a corollary of revolutionary social changes).[2][3]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Corollary"}
