{"title":"Edmonds–Karp algorithm","summary":"In computer science, the Edmonds–Karp algorithm is an implementation of the Ford–Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network in O ( | V | | E | 2 ) {\\displaystyle O(|V||E|^{2})} time. The algorithm was first published by Yefim Dinitz (whose name is also transliterated \"E. A. Dinic\", notably as author of his early papers) in 1970[1][2] and independently published by Jack Edmonds and Richard Karp in 1972.[3] Dinic's algorithm includes additional techniques that reduce the running time to O ( | V | 2 | E | ) {\\displaystyle O(|V|^{2}|E|)} .[2]","image":"ae5bc5dfaecce53a04efd47719ac640aa983e706.svg","url":"Edmonds–Karp_algorithm"}
