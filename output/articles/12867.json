{"title":"Quantum finite automaton","summary":"In quantum computing, quantum finite automata (QFA) or quantum state machines are a quantum analog of probabilistic automata or a Markov decision process. They provide a mathematical abstraction of real-world quantum computers. Several types of automata may be defined, including measure-once and measure-many automata.  Quantum finite automata can also be understood as the quantization of subshifts of finite type, or as a quantization of Markov chains. QFAs are, in turn, special cases of geometric finite automata or topological finite automata.","image":"2ae9f51e057331fd164907d9f8db2633caa24d04.svg","url":"Quantum_finite_automaton"}
