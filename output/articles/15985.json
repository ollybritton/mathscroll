{"title":"Transpose graph","summary":"In the mathematical and algorithmic study of graph theory, the converse,[1] transpose[2] or reverse[3] of a directed graph G is another directed graph on the same set of vertices with all of the edges reversed compared to the orientation of the corresponding edges in G. That is, if G contains an edge (u, v) then the converse/transpose/reverse of G contains an edge (v, u) and vice versa.","image":"Amirali_reverse.jpg.webp","url":"Transpose_graph"}
