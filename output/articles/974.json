{"title":"Arithmetic billiards","summary":"In recreational mathematics, arithmetic billiards provide a geometrical method to determine the least common multiple and the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers by making use of reflections inside a rectangle whose sides are the two given numbers. This is an easy example of trajectory analysis of dynamical billiards.","image":"Arithmetic-billiard-40-15.jpg.webp","url":"Arithmetic_billiards"}
