{"title":"Poisson algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Poisson algebra is an associative algebra together with a Lie bracket that also satisfies Leibniz's law; that is, the bracket is also a derivation. Poisson algebras appear naturally in Hamiltonian mechanics, and are also central in the study of  quantum groups. Manifolds with a Poisson algebra structure are known as Poisson manifolds, of which the symplectic manifolds and the Poisson–Lie groups are a special case.  The algebra is named in honour of Siméon Denis Poisson.","image":"d8aa6b60cc7f252ecf920a6af5b050fe018636f3.svg","url":"Poisson_algebra"}
