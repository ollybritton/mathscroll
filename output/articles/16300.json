{"title":"Ulam number","summary":"In mathematics, the Ulam numbers comprise an integer sequence devised by and named after Stanislaw Ulam, who introduced it in 1964.[1]  The standard Ulam sequence (the (1, 2)-Ulam  sequence) starts with U1 = 1 and U2 = 2.  Then for n > 2, Un is defined to be the smallest integer that is the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one way and larger than all earlier terms.","image":"dfa3d0486225dea5fdb00f3006f8bb670de139a2.svg","url":"Ulam_number"}
