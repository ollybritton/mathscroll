{"title":"Prewellordering","summary":"In set theory, a prewellordering on a set X {\\displaystyle X} is a preorder ≤ {\\displaystyle \\leq } on X {\\displaystyle X} (a transitive and reflexive relation on X {\\displaystyle X} ) that is strongly connected (meaning that any two points are comparable) and well-founded in the sense that the induced relation x < y {\\displaystyle x<y} defined by x ≤ y and y ≰ x {\\displaystyle x\\leq y{\\text{ and }}y\\nleq x} is a well-founded relation.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Prewellordering"}
