{"title":"Eulerian path","summary":"In graph theory, an Eulerian trail (or Eulerian path) is a trail in a finite graph that visits every edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices). Similarly, an Eulerian circuit or Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian trail that starts and ends on the same vertex. They were first discussed by Leonhard Euler while solving the famous Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg problem in 1736. The problem can be stated mathematically like this:","image":"Comparison_7_bridges_of_Konigsberg_5_room_puzzle_graphs.svg.png.webp","url":"Eulerian_path"}
