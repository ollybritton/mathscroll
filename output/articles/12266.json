{"title":"Poisson's equation","summary":"Poisson's equation is an elliptic partial differential equation of broad utility in theoretical physics. For example, the solution to Poisson's equation is the potential field caused by a given electric charge or mass density distribution; with the potential field known, one can then calculate electrostatic or gravitational (force) field. It is a generalization of Laplace's equation, which is also frequently seen in physics.  The equation is named after French mathematician and physicist Sim√©on Denis Poisson.[1][2]","image":"Simeon_Poisson.jpg.webp","url":"Poisson's_equation"}
