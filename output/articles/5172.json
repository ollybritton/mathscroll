{"title":"Exponential family","summary":"In probability and statistics, an exponential family is a parametric set of probability distributions of a certain form, specified below. This special form is chosen for mathematical convenience, including the enabling of the user to calculate expectations, covariances using differentiation based on some useful algebraic properties, as well as for generality, as exponential families are in a sense very natural sets of distributions to consider. The term exponential class is sometimes used in place of \"exponential family\",[1] or the older term Koopmanâ€“Darmois family. The terms \"distribution\" and \"family\" are often used loosely: specifically, an exponential family is a set of distributions, where the specific distribution varies with the parameter;[lower-alpha 1] however, a parametric family of distributions is often referred to as \"a distribution\" (like \"the normal distribution\", meaning \"the family of normal distributions\"), and the set of all exponential families is sometimes loosely referred to as \"the\" exponential family. They are distinct because they possess a variety of desirable properties, most importantly the existence of a sufficient statistic.","image":"b0fe1a16a55ec44ac2728f28a48562ab674e0d15.svg","url":"Exponential_family"}
