{"title":"Trapezohedron","summary":"In geometry, an n-gonal trapezohedron, n-trapezohedron, n-antidipyramid, n-antibipyramid, or n-deltohedron is the dual polyhedron of an n-gonal antiprism. The 2n faces of an n-trapezohedron are congruent and symmetrically staggered; they are called twisted kites. With a higher symmetry, its 2n faces are kites (also called deltoids).[3]","image":"Pentagonal_trapezohedron.svg.png.webp","url":"Trapezohedron"}
