{"title":"Lambert quadrilateral","summary":"In geometry, a Lambert quadrilateral (also known as Ibn al-Haythamâ€“Lambert quadrilateral),[1][2] is a quadrilateral in which three of its angles are right angles. Historically, the fourth angle of a Lambert quadrilateral was of considerable interest since if it could be shown to be a right angle, then the Euclidean parallel postulate could be proved as a theorem. It is now known that the type of the fourth angle depends upon the geometry in which the quadrilateral exists. In hyperbolic geometry the fourth angle is acute, in Euclidean geometry it is a right angle and in elliptic geometry it is an obtuse angle.","image":"Lambert_quadrilateral.svg.png.webp","url":"Lambert_quadrilateral"}
