{"title":"Function field of an algebraic variety","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the function field of an algebraic variety V consists of objects which are interpreted as rational functions on V. In classical algebraic geometry they are ratios of polynomials; in complex algebraic geometry these are meromorphic functions and their higher-dimensional analogues; in modern algebraic geometry they are elements of some quotient ring's field of fractions.","image":"89590903619b6fd9ddab0aa710c2eb50edc781f1.svg","url":"Function_field_of_an_algebraic_variety"}
