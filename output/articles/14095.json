{"title":"Selfridge–Conway procedure","summary":"The Selfridge–Conway procedure is a discrete procedure that produces an envy-free cake-cutting for three partners.[1]: 13–14   It is named after John Selfridge and John Horton Conway. Selfridge discovered it in 1960, and told it to Richard Guy, who told many people, but Selfridge did not publish it. John Conway later discovered it independently, and also never published it.[2] This procedure was the first envy-free discrete procedure devised for three partners, and it paved the way for more advanced procedures for n partners (see envy-free cake-cutting).","image":"Selfridge–Conway.svg.png.webp","url":"Selfridge–Conway_procedure"}
