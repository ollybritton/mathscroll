{"title":"Euler diagram","summary":"An Euler diagram (/ˈɔɪlər/, OY-lər) is a diagrammatic means of representing sets and their relationships.  They are particularly useful for explaining complex hierarchies and overlapping definitions. They are similar to another set diagramming technique, Venn diagrams.  Unlike Venn diagrams, which show all possible relations between different sets, the Euler diagram shows only relevant relationships.","image":"EulerDiagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Euler_diagram"}
