{"title":"Least fixed point","summary":"In order theory, a branch of mathematics, the least fixed point (lfp or LFP, sometimes also smallest fixed point) of a function from a partially ordered set to itself is the fixed point which is less than each other fixed point, according to the order of the poset. A function need not have a least fixed point, but if it does then the least fixed point is unique.","image":"Puntos_fijos.svg.png.webp","url":"Least_fixed_point"}
