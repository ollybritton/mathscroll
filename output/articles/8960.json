{"title":"Lagrangian relaxation","summary":"In the field of mathematical optimization, Lagrangian relaxation is a relaxation method which approximates a difficult problem of constrained optimization by a simpler problem. A solution to the relaxed problem is an approximate solution to the original problem, and provides useful information.","image":"c520ee2cb6ccf8a93c89a8c58a8378796bd52e53.svg","url":"Lagrangian_relaxation"}
