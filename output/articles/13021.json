{"title":"Rader's FFT algorithm","summary":"Rader's algorithm (1968),[1] named for Charles M. Rader of MIT Lincoln Laboratory, is a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of prime sizes by re-expressing the DFT as a cyclic convolution (the other algorithm for FFTs of prime sizes, Bluestein's algorithm, also works by rewriting the DFT as a convolution).","image":"3bab32900e0cbcdf2743e43f83431e87e56c734e.svg","url":"Rader's_FFT_algorithm"}
