{"title":"Medial rhombic triacontahedron","summary":"In geometry, the medial rhombic triacontahedron (or midly rhombic triacontahedron) is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron. It is a stellation of the rhombic triacontahedron, and can also be called small stellated triacontahedron. Its dual is the dodecadodecahedron.","image":"DU36_medial_rhombic_triacontahedron.png.webp","url":"Medial_rhombic_triacontahedron"}
