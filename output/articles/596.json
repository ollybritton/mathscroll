{"title":"Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry","summary":"In mathematics, algebraic geometry and analytic geometry are two closely related subjects. While algebraic geometry studies algebraic varieties, analytic geometry deals with complex manifolds and the more general analytic spaces defined locally by the vanishing of analytic functions of several complex variables. The deep relation between these subjects has numerous applications in which algebraic techniques are applied to analytic spaces and analytic techniques to algebraic varieties.","image":"205d4b91000d9dcf1a5bbabdfa6a8395fa60b676.svg","url":"Algebraic_geometry_and_analytic_geometry"}
