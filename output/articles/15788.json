{"title":"Tilted large deviation principle","summary":"In mathematics — specifically, in large deviations theory — the tilted large deviation principle is a result that allows one to generate a new large deviation principle from an old one by \"tilting\", i.e. integration against an exponential functional.  It can be seen as an alternative formulation of Varadhan's lemma.","image":"d0e341f8a0a743a8fe1053e46df4cdb7e69ff532.svg","url":"Tilted_large_deviation_principle"}
