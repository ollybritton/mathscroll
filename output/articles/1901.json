{"title":"Bounding volume","summary":"In computer graphics and computational geometry, a bounding volume for a set of objects is a closed volume that completely contains the union of the objects in the set. Bounding volumes are used to improve the efficiency of geometrical operations by using simple volumes to contain more complex objects. Normally, simpler volumes have simpler ways to test for overlap.","image":"BoundingBox.jpg.webp","url":"Bounding_volume"}
