{"title":"Paley–Wiener theorem","summary":"In mathematics, a Paley–Wiener theorem is any theorem that relates decay properties of a function or distribution at infinity with analyticity of its Fourier transform.  The theorem is named for Raymond Paley (1907–1933) and Norbert Wiener (1894–1964).  The original theorems did not use the language of distributions, and instead applied to square-integrable functions.  The first such theorem using distributions was due to Laurent Schwartz. These theorems heavily rely on the triangle inequality (to interchange the absolute value and integration).","image":"c04a58fadec1e21c19b1e0eafb482b7e34794365.svg","url":"Paley–Wiener_theorem"}
