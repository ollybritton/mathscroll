{"title":"Caristi fixed-point theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Caristi fixed-point theorem (also known as the Caristi–Kirk fixed-point theorem) generalizes the Banach fixed-point theorem for maps of a complete metric space into itself. Caristi's fixed-point theorem modifies the ε {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon } -variational principle of Ekeland (1974, 1979).[1][2] The conclusion of Caristi's theorem is equivalent to metric completeness, as proved by Weston (1977).[3] The original result is due to the mathematicians James Caristi and William Arthur Kirk.[4]","image":"a30c89172e5b88edbd45d3e2772c7f5e562e5173.svg","url":"Caristi_fixed-point_theorem"}
