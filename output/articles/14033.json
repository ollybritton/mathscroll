{"title":"Search problem","summary":"In the mathematics of computational complexity theory, computability theory, and decision theory, a search problem is a type of computational problem represented by a binary relation. Intuitively, the problem consists in finding structure \"y\" in object \"x\". An algorithm is said to solve the problem if at least one corresponding structure exists, and then one occurrence of this structure is made output; otherwise, the algorithm stops with an appropriate output (\"not found\" or any message of the like).","image":"66aeab422e58339ebc76959b7bb309bcda3b9e8b.svg","url":"Search_problem"}
