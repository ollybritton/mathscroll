{"title":"Adaptive Simpson's method","summary":"Adaptive Simpson's method, also called adaptive Simpson's rule, is a method of numerical integration proposed by G.F. Kuncir in 1962.[1] It is probably the first recursive adaptive algorithm for numerical integration to appear in print,[2] although more modern adaptive methods based on Gauss–Kronrod quadrature and Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature are now generally preferred. Adaptive Simpson's method uses an estimate of the error we get from calculating a definite integral using Simpson's rule.  If the error exceeds a user-specified tolerance, the algorithm calls for subdividing the interval of integration in two and applying adaptive Simpson's method to each subinterval in a recursive manner.  The technique is usually much more efficient than composite Simpson's rule since it uses fewer function evaluations in places where the function is well-approximated by a cubic function.","image":"6ed50619814a66d85322e99edee609fb6533cfc4.svg","url":"Adaptive_Simpson's_method"}
