{"title":"Hyperbolic 3-manifold","summary":"In mathematics, more precisely in topology and differential geometry, a hyperbolic 3-manifold is a manifold of dimension 3 equipped with a hyperbolic metric, that is a Riemannian metric which has all its sectional curvatures equal to âˆ’1. It is generally required that this metric be also complete: in this case the manifold can be realised as a quotient of the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space by a discrete group of isometries (a Kleinian group).","image":"057444bf35a0c22b19bcae1ef06e06ecdf8abe56.svg","url":"Hyperbolic_3-manifold"}
