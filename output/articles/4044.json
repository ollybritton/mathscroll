{"title":"Diagonalizable matrix","summary":"In linear algebra, a square matrix A {\\displaystyle A} is called diagonalizable or non-defective if it is similar to a diagonal matrix, i.e., if there exists an invertible matrix P {\\displaystyle P} and a diagonal matrix D {\\displaystyle D} such that P − 1 A P = D {\\displaystyle P^{-1}AP=D} , or equivalently A = P D P − 1 {\\displaystyle A=PDP^{-1}} . (Such P {\\displaystyle P} , D {\\displaystyle D} are not unique.) For a finite-dimensional vector space V {\\displaystyle V} , a linear map T : V → V {\\displaystyle T:V\\to V} is called diagonalizable if there exists an ordered basis of V {\\displaystyle V} consisting of eigenvectors of T {\\displaystyle T} . These definitions are equivalent: if T {\\displaystyle T} has a matrix representation T = P D P − 1 {\\displaystyle T=PDP^{-1}} as above, then the column vectors of P {\\displaystyle P} form a basis consisting of eigenvectors of T {\\displaystyle T} , and the diagonal entries of D {\\displaystyle D} are the corresponding eigenvalues of T {\\displaystyle T} ; with respect to this eigenvector basis, A {\\displaystyle A} is represented by D {\\displaystyle D} . Diagonalization is the process of finding the above P {\\displaystyle P} and D {\\displaystyle D} .","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Diagonalizable_matrix"}
