{"title":"Atomic formula","summary":"In mathematical logic, an atomic formula (also known as an atom or a prime formula) is a formula with no deeper propositional structure, that is, a formula that contains no logical connectives or equivalently a formula that has no strict subformulas. Atoms are thus the simplest well-formed formulas of the logic. Compound formulas are formed by combining the atomic formulas using the logical connectives.","image":"bd32442250081113f4bf58af23f0967b4bbd91fd.svg","url":"Atomic_formula"}
