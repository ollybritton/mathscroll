{"title":"Schwarz lantern","summary":"In mathematics, the Schwarz lantern is a polyhedral approximation to a cylinder, used as a pathological example of the difficulty of defining the area of a smooth (curved) surface as the limit of the areas of polyhedra. It is formed by stacked rings of isosceles triangles, arranged within each ring in the same pattern as an antiprism. The resulting shape can be folded from paper, and is named after mathematician Hermann Schwarz and for its resemblance to a cylindrical paper lantern.[1] It is also known as Schwarz's boot,[2] Schwarz's polyhedron,[3] or the Chinese lantern.[4]","image":"Hermann_Amandus_Schwarz_-_Schwarzscher_Stiefel_-_Schwarz_boot_78.JPG.webp","url":"Schwarz_lantern"}
