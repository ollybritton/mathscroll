{"title":"Matrix population models","summary":"Matrix population models are a specific type of population model that uses matrix algebra. Population models are used in population ecology to model the dynamics of wildlife or human populations. Matrix algebra, in turn, is simply a form of algebraic shorthand for summarizing a larger number of often repetitious and tedious algebraic computations.","image":"2ad80ce9406cd8a34131372e01e2758e2854a2c3.svg","url":"Matrix_population_models"}
