{"title":"Bartels–Stewart algorithm","summary":"In numerical linear algebra, the Bartels–Stewart algorithm is used to numerically solve the Sylvester matrix equation A X − X B = C {\\displaystyle AX-XB=C} . Developed by R.H. Bartels and G.W. Stewart in 1971,[1] it was the first numerically stable method that could be systematically applied to solve such equations. The algorithm works by using the real Schur decompositions of A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} to transform A X − X B = C {\\displaystyle AX-XB=C} into a triangular system that can then be solved using forward or backward substitution. In 1979, G. Golub, C. Van Loan and S. Nash introduced an improved version of the algorithm,[2] known as the Hessenberg–Schur algorithm. It remains a standard approach for solving  Sylvester equations when X {\\displaystyle X} is of small to moderate size.","image":"ed9cbe23148c800d58dbc85eb10ad606c65442f7.svg","url":"Bartels–Stewart_algorithm"}
