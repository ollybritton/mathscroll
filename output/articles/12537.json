{"title":"Prismatoid","summary":"In geometry, a prismatoid is a polyhedron whose vertices all lie in two parallel planes. Its lateral faces can be trapezoids or triangles.[1] If both planes have the same number of vertices, and the lateral faces are either parallelograms or trapezoids, it is called a prismoid.[2]","image":"Prismatoid_(parameters_h%2CA₁%2CA₂%2CA₃).svg.png.webp","url":"Prismatoid"}
