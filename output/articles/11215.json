{"title":"Normal coordinates","summary":"In differential geometry, normal coordinates at a point p in a differentiable manifold equipped with a symmetric affine connection are a local coordinate system in a neighborhood of p obtained by applying the exponential map to the tangent space at p.  In a normal coordinate system, the Christoffel symbols of the connection vanish at the point p, thus often simplifying local calculations.  In normal coordinates associated to the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian manifold, one can additionally arrange that the metric tensor is the Kronecker delta at the point p, and that the first partial derivatives of the metric at p vanish.","image":"3f5f49dda6ee5633bfa1f7156444acbe4d0e3268.svg","url":"Normal_coordinates"}
