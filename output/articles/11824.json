{"title":"Parseval's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Parseval's theorem[1] usually refers to the result that the Fourier transform is unitary; loosely, that the sum (or integral) of the square of a function is equal to the sum (or integral) of the square of its transform.  It originates from a 1799 theorem about series by Marc-Antoine Parseval, which was later applied to the Fourier series.  It is also known as Rayleigh's energy theorem, or Rayleigh's identity, after John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh.[2]","image":"b078651e6d1a522e8955b73059fbd63e13aec616.svg","url":"Parseval's_theorem"}
