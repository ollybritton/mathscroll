{"title":"Square (algebra)","summary":"In mathematics, a square is the result of multiplying a number by itself. The verb \"to square\" is used to denote this operation. Squaring is the same as raising to the powerÂ 2, and is denoted by a superscript 2; for instance, the square of 3 may be written as 32, which is the number 9. In some cases when superscripts are not available, as for instance in programming languages or plain text files, the notations x^2 (caret) or x**2 may be used in place of x2. The adjective which corresponds to squaring is quadratic.","image":"Five_Squared.svg.png.webp","url":"Square_(algebra)"}
