{"title":"Enriques–Kodaira classification","summary":"In mathematics, the Enriques–Kodaira classification is a classification of compact complex surfaces into ten classes. For each of these classes, the surfaces in the class can be parametrized by a moduli space. For most of the classes the moduli spaces are well understood, but for the class of surfaces of general type the moduli spaces seem too complicated to describe explicitly, though some components are known.","image":"Geography_of_surfaces.jpg.webp","url":"Enriques–Kodaira_classification"}
