{"title":"Node influence metric","summary":"In graph theory and network analysis, node influence metrics are measures that rank or quantify the influence of every node (also called vertex) within a graph. They are related to  centrality indices. Applications include measuring the influence of each person in a social network, understanding the role of infrastructure nodes in transportation networks, the Internet, or urban networks, and the participation of a given node in disease dynamics.","image":"b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a.svg","url":"Node_influence_metric"}
