{"title":"Numerical weather prediction","summary":"Numerical weather prediction (NWP) uses  mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather based on current weather conditions. Though first attempted in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of computer simulation in the 1950s that numerical weather predictions produced realistic results.  A number of global and regional forecast models are run in different countries worldwide, using current weather observations relayed from radiosondes, weather satellites and other observing systems as inputs.","image":"AtmosphericModelSchematic.png.webp","url":"Numerical_weather_prediction"}
