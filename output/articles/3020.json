{"title":"Complex measure","summary":"In mathematics, specifically measure theory, a complex measure generalizes the concept of measure by letting it have complex values. In other words, one allows for sets whose size (length, area, volume) is a complex number.","image":"9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161.svg","url":"Complex_measure"}
