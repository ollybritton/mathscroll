{"title":"Hilbert's thirteenth problem","summary":"Hilbert's thirteenth  problem is one of the 23 Hilbert problems set out in a celebrated list compiled in 1900 by David Hilbert.  It entails proving whether a solution exists for all 7th-degree equations using algebraic (variant: continuous) functions of two arguments. It was first presented in the context of nomography, and in particular \"nomographic construction\" — a process whereby a function of several variables is constructed using functions of two variables. The variant for continuous functions was resolved affirmatively in 1957 by Vladimir Arnold when he proved the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem, but the variant for algebraic functions remains unresolved.","image":"cfa4d21c12d29f2b6bb35bd75a8403aaf8b4d434.svg","url":"Hilbert's_thirteenth_problem"}
