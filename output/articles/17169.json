{"title":"Zhang Luping","summary":"Zhang Luping (simplified Chinese: 张鹭平; traditional Chinese: 張鹭平; 1945-1998) was a Chinese martial artist and mathematician born in Jiaxing, Zhejiang province. He was best known in China for his exceptional skill at tai chi's push hands, and for an incident in his hometown in which he accidentally broke a weightlifting champion’s forearm during an arm wrestling match. He was a student of Cai Hong Xiang (蔡鸿祥),[1]: 2–7  Wang Zi-Ping (王子平),[1]: 6  and Fu Zhong Wen (傅鍾文) .[1] He was also a descendant of Zhang Jun (traditional Chinese: 張浚; simplified Chinese: 张浚; pinyin: Zhāng Jùn, 1097–1164) and of Zhang Jiugao (simplified Chinese: 張九皋), who was the brother of Zhang Jiuling (simplified Chinese: 张九龄). He was noted for his deep knowledge of the five styles of tai chi, his superb application of the principles, and his highly developed internal power. In an age when many great martial arts teachers remained reluctant to share their highest insights and techniques, Zhang championed in his teaching an attitude of openness and a strong desire to ensure the continuation of Chinese martial traditions.","image":"Taichi_luping.jpg.webp","url":"Zhang_Luping"}
