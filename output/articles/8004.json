{"title":"Inverse quadratic interpolation","summary":"In numerical analysis, inverse quadratic interpolation is a root-finding algorithm, meaning that it is an algorithm for solving equations of the form f(x) = 0. The idea is to use quadratic interpolation to approximate the inverse of f. This algorithm is rarely used on its own, but it is important because it forms part of the popular Brent's method.","image":"0d4412e1e51a4cb9c8a6bfbdfe85ba977d188956.svg","url":"Inverse_quadratic_interpolation"}
