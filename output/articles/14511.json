{"title":"Slater's condition","summary":"In mathematics, Slater's condition (or Slater condition) is a sufficient condition for strong duality to hold for a convex optimization problem, named after Morton L. Slater.[1]  Informally, Slater's condition states that the feasible region must have an interior point (see technical details below).","image":"016e55d3911b847b19d9aa85d971be3a51f7efb8.svg","url":"Slater's_condition"}
