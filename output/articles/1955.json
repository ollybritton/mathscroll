{"title":"Brauer–Siegel theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Brauer–Siegel theorem, named after Richard Brauer and Carl Ludwig Siegel, is an asymptotic result on the behaviour of algebraic number fields, obtained by Richard Brauer and Carl Ludwig Siegel. It attempts to generalise the results known on the class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields, to a more general sequence of number fields","image":"2f43a1253fe29d5bfeb33f72a4a27a1ab9ad456e.svg","url":"Brauer–Siegel_theorem"}
