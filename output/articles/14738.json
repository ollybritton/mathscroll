{"title":"Spectral gap","summary":"In mathematics, the spectral gap is the difference between the moduli of the two largest eigenvalues of a matrix or operator; alternately, it is sometimes taken as the smallest non-zero eigenvalue.  Various theorems relate this difference to other properties of the system.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Spectral_gap"}
