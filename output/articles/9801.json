{"title":"Lévy process","summary":"In probability theory, a Lévy process, named after the French mathematician Paul Lévy, is a stochastic process  with independent, stationary increments: it represents the motion of a point whose successive displacements are random, in which displacements in pairwise disjoint time intervals are independent, and displacements in different time intervals of the same length have identical probability distributions. A Lévy process may thus be viewed as the continuous-time analog of a random walk.","image":"2341270b3e280d3811991f99e9d5eb7fcb62508f.svg","url":"Lévy_process"}
