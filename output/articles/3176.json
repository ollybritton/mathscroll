{"title":"Conference matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a conference matrix (also called a C-matrix) is a square matrix C with 0 on the diagonal and +1 and −1 off the diagonal, such that CTC is a multiple of the identity matrix I.  Thus, if the matrix has order n, CTC = (n−1)I. Some authors use a more general definition, which requires there to be a single 0 in each row and column but not necessarily on the diagonal.[1][2]","image":"9d546fdd2bd9030ca13cc6c1a15f921392f9ed4d.svg","url":"Conference_matrix"}
