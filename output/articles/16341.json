{"title":"Uniform 1 k2 polytope","summary":"In geometry, 1k2 polytope is a uniform polytope in n-dimensions (n = k+4) constructed from the En Coxeter group. The family was named by their Coxeter symbol 1k2 by its bifurcating Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, with a single ring on the end of the 1-node sequence. It can be named by an extended Schläfli symbol {3,3k,2}.","image":"4-simplex_t0.svg.png.webp","url":"Uniform_1_k2_polytope"}
