{"title":"Exponential hierarchy","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the exponential hierarchy is a hierarchy of complexity classes that is an exponential time analogue of the polynomial hierarchy. As elsewhere in complexity theory, “exponential” is used in two different meanings (linear exponential bounds 2 c n {\\displaystyle 2^{cn}} for a constant c, and full exponential bounds 2 n c {\\displaystyle 2^{n^{c}}} ), leading to two versions of the exponential hierarchy.[1][2] This hierarchy is sometimes also referred to as the weak exponential hierarchy, to differentiate it from the strong exponential hierarchy.[2][3]","image":"0f95045ced4488d99fcc4928eba8e792a57d2f62.svg","url":"Exponential_hierarchy"}
