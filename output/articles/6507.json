{"title":"Great cubicuboctahedron","summary":"In geometry, the great cubicuboctahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U14. It has 20 faces (8 triangles, 6 squares and 6 octagrams), 48 edges, and 24 vertices.[1] Its square faces and its octagrammic faces are parallel to those of a cube, while its triangular faces are parallel to those of an octahedron: hence the name cubicuboctahedron. The great suffix serves to distinguish it from the small cubicuboctahedron, which also has faces in the aforementioned directions.[2]","image":"Great_cubicuboctahedron.png.webp","url":"Great_cubicuboctahedron"}
