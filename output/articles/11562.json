{"title":"Ordinary differential equation","summary":"In mathematics, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a differential equation (DE) dependent on only a single independent variable. As with other DE, its unknown(s) consists of one (or more) function(s) and involves the derivatives of those functions.[1] The term \"ordinary\" is used in contrast with partial differential equations which may be with respect to more than one independent variable.[2]","image":"Parabolic_trajectory.svg.png.webp","url":"Ordinary_differential_equation"}
