{"title":"Laplace–Beltrami operator","summary":"In differential geometry, the Laplace–Beltrami operator is a generalization of the Laplace operator to functions defined on submanifolds in Euclidean space and, even more generally, on Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. It is named after Pierre-Simon Laplace and Eugenio Beltrami.","image":"242404c01e2e29c90f8c878d7a35a0124b1346b2.svg","url":"Laplace–Beltrami_operator"}
