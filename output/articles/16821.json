{"title":"Weil's conjecture on Tamagawa numbers","summary":"In mathematics, the Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers is the statement that the Tamagawa number Ï„ ( G ) {\\displaystyle \\tau (G)} of a simply connected simple algebraic group defined over a number field is 1. In this case, simply connected means \"not having a proper algebraic covering\" in the algebraic group theory sense, which is not always the topologists' meaning.","image":"a59413d463ac9812a45c84675be86376f374320e.svg","url":"Weil's_conjecture_on_Tamagawa_numbers"}
