{"title":"NTIME","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the complexity class NTIME(f(n)) is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a non-deterministic Turing machine which runs in time O(f(n)). Here O is the big O notation, f is some function, and n is the size of the input (for which the problem is to be decided).","image":"3753fc46abcb1dd9e174c22923b2643f259f9eb1.svg","url":"NTIME"}
