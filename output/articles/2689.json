{"title":"Cissoid of Diocles","summary":"In geometry, the cissoid of Diocles (from Ancient Greek  κισσοειδής (kissoeidēs) 'ivy-shaped'; named for Diocles) is a cubic plane curve notable for the property that it can be used to construct two mean proportionals to a given ratio. In particular, it can be used to double a cube. It can be defined as the cissoid of a circle and a line tangent to it with respect to the point on the circle opposite to the point of tangency. In fact, the curve family of cissoids is named for this example and some authors refer to it simply as the cissoid. It has a single cusp at the pole, and is symmetric about the diameter of the circle which is the line of tangency of the cusp. The line is an asymptote. It is a member of the conchoid of de Sluze family of curves and in form it resembles a tractrix.","image":"Cissoide2.svg.png.webp","url":"Cissoid_of_Diocles"}
