{"title":"Root-finding algorithms","summary":"In mathematics and computing, a root-finding algorithm is an algorithm for finding zeros, also called \"roots\", of continuous functions. A zero of a function f, from the real numbers to real numbers or from the complex numbers to the complex numbers, is a number x such that f(x) = 0. As, generally, the zeros of a function cannot be computed exactly nor expressed in closed form, root-finding algorithms provide approximations to zeros, expressed either as floating-point numbers or as small isolating intervals,  or disks for complex roots (an interval or disk output being equivalent to an approximate output together with an error bound).[1]","image":"363c8ad19266ae04e84dcee9859f016ba7e7d295.svg","url":"Root-finding_algorithms"}
