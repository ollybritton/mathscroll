{"title":"Constructive function theory","summary":"In mathematical analysis, constructive function theory is a field which studies the connection between the smoothness of a function and its degree of approximation.[1][2] It is closely related to approximation theory. The term was coined by Sergei Bernstein.","image":"9e71ec5ee9c048f7b69e50e2f1ba9198d3398c9b.svg","url":"Constructive_function_theory"}
