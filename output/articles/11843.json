{"title":"Partial permutation","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, a partial permutation, or sequence without repetition, on a finite set S is a bijection between two specified subsets of S. That is, it is defined by two subsets U and V of equal size, and a one-to-one mapping from U to V. Equivalently, it is a partial function on S that can be extended to a permutation.[1][2]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Partial_permutation"}
