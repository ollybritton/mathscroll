{"title":"Information set (game theory)","summary":"In game theory, an information set is a set for a particular player that, given what that player has observed, shows the decision vertices available to the player which are undistinguishable to them at the current point in the game. For a better idea on decision vertices, refer to Figure 1. If the game has perfect information, every information set contains only one member, namely the point actually reached at that stage of the game, since each player knows the exact mix of chance moves and player strategies up to the current point in the game. Otherwise, it is the case that some players cannot be sure exactly what has taken place so far in the game and what their position is.","image":"Cuban_Missile_Crisis_Game_Tree.svg.png.webp","url":"Information_set_(game_theory)"}
