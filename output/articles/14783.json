{"title":"Spherical geometry","summary":"Spherical geometry is the geometry of the two-dimensional surface of a sphere.[lower-alpha 1] Long studied for its practical applications – spherical trigonometry – to navigation, spherical geometry bears many similarities and relationships to, and important differences from, Euclidean plane geometry.   The sphere has for the most part been studied as a part of 3-dimensional Euclidean geometry (often called solid geometry), the surface thought of as placed inside an ambient 3-d space.  It can also be analyzed by \"intrinsic\" methods that only involve the surface itself, and do not refer to, or even assume the existence of, any surrounding space outside or inside the sphere.","image":"Stereographic_projection_in_3D.svg.png.webp","url":"Spherical_geometry"}
