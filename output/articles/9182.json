{"title":"Lemma (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, informal logic and argument mapping, a lemma (plural lemmas or lemmata) is a generally minor, proven proposition which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result. For that reason, it is also known as a \"helping theorem\" or an \"auxiliary theorem\".[1][2] In many cases, a lemma derives its importance from the theorem it aims to prove; however, a lemma can also turn out to be more important than originally thought.[3] The word \"lemma\" derives from the Ancient Greek λῆμμα (\"anything which is received\",[2] such as a gift, profit, or a bribe).","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Lemma_(mathematics)"}
