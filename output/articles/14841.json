{"title":"Spray (mathematics)","summary":"In differential geometry, a spray is a vector field H on the tangent bundle TM that encodes a quasilinear second order system of ordinary differential equations on the base manifold M. Usually a spray is required to be homogeneous in the sense that its integral curves t→ΦHt(ξ)∈TM obey the rule ΦHt(λξ)=ΦHλt(ξ) in positive reparameterizations. If this requirement is dropped, H is called a semispray.","image":"fc4ed00a9968cc0fa182388a1a70ad2b07128ce5.svg","url":"Spray_(mathematics)"}
