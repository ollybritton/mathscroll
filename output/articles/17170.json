{"title":"Zhang Qiujian Suanjing","summary":"Zhang Qiujian Suanjing (The Mathematical Classic of Zhang Qiujian) is the only known work of the fifth century Chinese mathematician, Zhang Qiujian. It is one of ten mathematical books known collectively as Suanjing shishu (The Ten Computational Canons). In 656 CE, when mathematics was included in the imperial examinations, these ten outstanding works were selected as textbooks. Jiuzhang suanshu (The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art) and Sunzi Suanjing (The Mathematical Classic of Sunzi) are two of these texts that precede Zhang Qiujian suanjing. All three works share a large number of common topics. In Zhang Qiujian suanjing one can find the continuation of the development of mathematics from the earlier two classics.[1] Internal evidences suggest that book was compiled sometime between 466 and 485 CE.","image":"张邱建算经.jpg.webp","url":"Zhang_Qiujian_Suanjing"}
