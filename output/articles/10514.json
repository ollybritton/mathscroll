{"title":"Minkowski inequality","summary":"In mathematical analysis, the Minkowski inequality establishes that the Lp spaces are normed vector spaces. Let S {\\displaystyle S} be a measure space, let 1 ≤ p < ∞ {\\displaystyle 1\\leq p<\\infty } and let f {\\displaystyle f} and g {\\displaystyle g} be elements of L p ( S ) . {\\displaystyle L^{p}(S).} Then f + g {\\displaystyle f+g} is in L p ( S ) , {\\displaystyle L^{p}(S),} and we have the triangle inequality","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Minkowski_inequality"}
