{"title":"Generalized linear mixed model","summary":"In statistics, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) is an extension to the generalized linear model (GLM) in which the linear predictor contains random effects in addition to the usual fixed effects.[1][2][3]  They also inherit from GLMs the idea of extending linear mixed models to non-normal data.","image":"c3e6bb763d22c20916ed4f0bb6bd49d7470cffd8.svg","url":"Generalized_linear_mixed_model"}
