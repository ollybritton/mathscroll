{"title":"Antisymmetric tensor","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical physics, a tensor is antisymmetric on (or with respect to) an index subset if it alternates sign (+/âˆ’) when any two indices of the subset are interchanged.[1][2] The index subset must generally either be all covariant or all contravariant.","image":"a81f2ef2945250357e7b5d0745776ffe51c9e6b4.svg","url":"Antisymmetric_tensor"}
