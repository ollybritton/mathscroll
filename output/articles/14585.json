{"title":"Smooth topology","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the smooth topology is a certain Grothendieck topology, which is finer than étale topology. Its main use is to define the cohomology of an algebraic stack with coefficients in, say, the étale sheaf Q l {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} _{l}} .","image":"5e99302348e0e30d6d00f0366952d2ea828aedde.svg","url":"Smooth_topology"}
