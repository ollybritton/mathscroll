{"title":"Binary matroid","summary":"In matroid theory, a binary matroid is a matroid that can be represented over the finite field GF(2).[1] That is, up to isomorphism, they are the matroids whose elements are the columns of a (0,1)-matrix and whose sets of elements are independent if and only if the corresponding columns are linearly independent in GF(2).","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Binary_matroid"}
