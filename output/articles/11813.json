{"title":"Paris–Harrington theorem","summary":"In mathematical logic, the Paris–Harrington theorem states that a certain combinatorial principle in Ramsey theory, namely the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem, which is expressible in Peano arithmetic, is not provable in this system. The combinatorial principle is however provable in slightly stronger systems.","image":"15acff6dfa6a76a24c9290bafe2cb511b0ae287b.svg","url":"Paris–Harrington_theorem"}
