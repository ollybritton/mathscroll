{"title":"Berezin transform","summary":"In mathematics — specifically, in complex analysis — the Berezin transform is an integral operator acting on functions defined on the open unit disk D of the complex plane C. Formally, for a function ƒ : D → C, the Berezin transform of ƒ is a new function Bƒ : D → C defined at a point z ∈ D by","image":"05044538bfa2df7b061ac3a4f15b1728dc3b8907.svg","url":"Berezin_transform"}
