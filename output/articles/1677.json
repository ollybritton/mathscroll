{"title":"Bipartite dimension","summary":"In the mathematical fields of graph theory and combinatorial optimization, the bipartite dimension or biclique cover number of a graph G = (V, E) is the minimum number of bicliques (that is complete bipartite subgraphs), needed to cover all edges in E. A collection of bicliques covering all edges in G is called a biclique edge cover, or sometimes biclique cover. The bipartite dimension of G is often denoted by the symbol d(G).","image":"Bipartite-dimension-bipartite-graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Bipartite_dimension"}
