He is best known for Zorn's lemma, a method used in set theory that is applicable to a wide range of mathematical constructs such as vector spaces, and ordered sets amongst others. Zorn's lemma was first postulated by Kazimierz Kuratowski in 1922, and then independently by Zorn in 1935.","image":"Zorn%2CMax_August_1930_Jena.jpg.webp","url":"Max_August_Zorn"}
