{"title":"Nested triangles graph","summary":"In graph theory, a nested triangles graph with n vertices is a planar graph formed from a sequence of n/3 triangles, by connecting pairs of corresponding vertices on consecutive triangles in the sequence. It can also be formed geometrically, by gluing together n/3 − 1 triangular prisms on their triangular faces. This graph, and graphs closely related to it, have been frequently used in graph drawing to prove lower bounds on the area requirements of various styles of drawings.","image":"Nested_triangle_graph_18.svg.png.webp","url":"Nested_triangles_graph"}
