{"title":"Hypercube graph","summary":"In graph theory, the  hypercube graph Qn is the graph formed from the vertices and edges of an n-dimensional hypercube. For instance, the cube graph Q3 is the graph formed by the 8 vertices and 12 edges of a three-dimensional cube. Qn has 2n vertices, 2n â€“ 1n edges, and is a regular graph with n edges touching each vertex.","image":"Hypercubestar.svg.png.webp","url":"Hypercube_graph"}
