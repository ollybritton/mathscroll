{"title":"Brouwer fixed-point theorem","summary":"Brouwer's fixed-point theorem is a fixed-point theorem in topology, named after L. E. J. (Bertus) Brouwer. It states that for any continuous function f {\\displaystyle f} mapping a compact convex set to itself there is a point x 0 {\\displaystyle x_{0}} such that f ( x 0 ) = x 0 {\\displaystyle f(x_{0})=x_{0}} . The simplest forms of Brouwer's theorem are for continuous functions f {\\displaystyle f} from a closed interval I {\\displaystyle I} in the real numbers to itself or from a closed disk D {\\displaystyle D} to itself. A more general form than the latter is for continuous functions from a convex compact subset K {\\displaystyle K} of Euclidean space to itself.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem"}
