{"title":"Von Kármán swirling flow","summary":"Von Kármán swirling flow is a flow created by a uniformly rotating infinitely long plane disk, named after Theodore von Kármán who solved the problem in 1921.[1] The rotating disk acts as a fluid pump and is used as a model for centrifugal fans or compressors. This flow is classified under the category of steady flows in which vorticity generated at a solid surface is prevented from diffusing far away by an opposing convection, the other examples being the Blasius boundary layer with suction, stagnation point flow etc.","image":"24b0d5ca6f381068d756f6337c08e0af9d1eeb6f.svg","url":"Von_Kármán_swirling_flow"}
