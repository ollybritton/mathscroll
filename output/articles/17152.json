{"title":"Zero divisor","summary":"In abstract algebra, an element a of a ring R is called a left zero divisor if there exists a nonzero x in R such that ax = 0,[1] or equivalently if the map from R to R that sends x to ax is not injective.[lower-alpha 1]  Similarly, an element a of a ring is called a right zero divisor if there exists a nonzero y in R such that ya = 0.  This is a partial case of divisibility in rings.  An element that is a left or a right zero divisor is simply called a zero divisor.[2] An elementÂ a that is both a left and a right zero divisor is called a two-sided zero divisor (the nonzero x such that ax = 0 may be different from the nonzero y such that ya = 0). If the ring is commutative, then the left and right zero divisors are the same.","image":"eb3ded1f832ca4738a18c9e4779381bd9591c058.svg","url":"Zero_divisor"}
