{"title":"Closed geodesic","summary":"In differential geometry and dynamical systems, a closed geodesic on a Riemannian manifold is a geodesic that returns to its starting point with the same tangent direction. It may be formalized as the projection of a closed orbit of the geodesic flow on the tangent space of the manifold.","image":"b3a24ed54bf9233a09f97976170cba703431f179.svg","url":"Closed_geodesic"}
