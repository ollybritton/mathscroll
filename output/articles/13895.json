{"title":"Sarti surface","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a Sarti surface is a degree-12 nodal surface with 600 nodes, found by Alessandra SartiÂ (2008). The maximal possible number of nodes of a degree-12 surface is not known (as of 2015), though Yoichi Miyaoka showed that it is at most 645.","image":"Sarti_surface.png.webp","url":"Sarti_surface"}
