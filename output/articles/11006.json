{"title":"Nest algebra","summary":"In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, nest algebras are a class of operator algebras that generalise the upper-triangular matrix algebras to a Hilbert space context. They were introduced by RingroseÂ (1965) and have many interesting properties. They are non-selfadjoint algebras, are closed in the weak operator topology and are reflexive.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Nest_algebra"}
