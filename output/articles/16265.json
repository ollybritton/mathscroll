{"title":"Two-dimensional Yang–Mills theory","summary":"In mathematical physics, two-dimensional Yang–Mills theory is the special case of Yang–Mills theory in which the dimension of spacetime is taken to be two. This special case allows for a rigorously defined Yang–Mills measure, meaning that the (Euclidean) path integral can be interpreted as a measure on the set of connections modulo gauge transformations. This situation contrasts with the four-dimensional case, where a rigorous construction of the theory as a measure is currently unknown.","image":"75bc0531863b76e4cb6239ccfc14804a5a817d1a.svg","url":"Two-dimensional_Yang–Mills_theory"}
