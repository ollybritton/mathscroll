{"title":"Sparsity matroid","summary":"A sparsity matroid is a mathematical structure that captures how densely a multigraph is populated with edges.  To unpack this a little, sparsity is a measure of density of a graph that bounds the number of edges in any subgraph. The property of having a particular matroid as its density measure is invariant under graph isomorphisms and so it is a graph invariant.","image":"c6596d38bbba96f6eda9c984af791cdd7790a802.svg","url":"Sparsity_matroid"}
