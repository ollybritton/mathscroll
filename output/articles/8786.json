{"title":"Kolakoski sequence","summary":"In mathematics, the Kolakoski sequence, sometimes also known as the Oldenburger–Kolakoski sequence,[1] is an infinite sequence of symbols {1,2} that is the sequence of run lengths in its own run-length encoding.[2] It is named after the recreational mathematician William Kolakoski (1944–97) who described it in 1965,[3] but it was previously discussed by Rufus Oldenburger in 1939.[1][4]","image":"Kolakoski_sequence_spiral.svg.png.webp","url":"Kolakoski_sequence"}
