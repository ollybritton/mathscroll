{"title":"Carleman matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a Carleman matrix is a matrix  used to convert function composition into matrix multiplication. It is often used in iteration theory to find the continuous iteration of functions which cannot be iterated by pattern recognition alone. Other uses of Carleman matrices occur in the theory of probability generating functions, and Markov chains.","image":"202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074.svg","url":"Carleman_matrix"}
