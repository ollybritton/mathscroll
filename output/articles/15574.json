{"title":"Tensor product of fields","summary":"In mathematics, the tensor product of two fields  is their tensor product as algebras over a common subfield. If no subfield is explicitly specified, the two fields must have the same characteristic and the common subfield is their prime subfield.","image":"97742bbd999545c785bb6451348ca0f5b915819b.svg","url":"Tensor_product_of_fields"}
