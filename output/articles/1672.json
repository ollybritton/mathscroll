{"title":"Biorthogonal nearly coiflet basis","summary":"In applied mathematics, biorthogonal nearly coiflet bases are wavelet bases proposed by Lowell L. Winger. The wavelet is based on biorthogonal coiflet wavelet bases, but sacrifices its regularity to increase the filter's bandwidth, which might lead to better image compression performance.","image":"6cf4a36b5f945be90a527b3dbe3d55d3f0439cdb.svg","url":"Biorthogonal_nearly_coiflet_basis"}
