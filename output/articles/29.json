{"title":"17-animal inheritance puzzle","summary":"The 17-animal inheritance puzzle is a mathematical puzzle involving unequal but fair item allocation of indivisible goods, usually stated in terms of inheritance of a number of large animals: 17 camels, 17 horses, 17 elephants, etc. Despite often being framed as a puzzle, it is more an anecdote about a curious calculation than a problem with a clear mathematical solution.[1]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"17-animal_inheritance_puzzle"}
