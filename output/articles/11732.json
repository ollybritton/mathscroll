{"title":"Palais–Smale compactness condition","summary":"The Palais–Smale compactness condition, named after Richard Palais and Stephen Smale, is a hypothesis for some theorems of the calculus of variations.  It is useful for guaranteeing the existence of certain kinds of critical points, in particular saddle points. The Palais-Smale condition is a condition on the functional that one is trying to extremize.","image":"a6edeb16060c6e21a29f489dd5fb95e4655c56c5.svg","url":"Palais–Smale_compactness_condition"}
