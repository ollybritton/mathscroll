{"title":"Robinson–Schensted correspondence","summary":"In mathematics, the Robinson–Schensted correspondence is a bijective correspondence between permutations and pairs of standard Young tableaux of the same shape. It has various descriptions, all of which are of algorithmic nature, it has many remarkable properties, and it has applications in combinatorics and other areas such as representation theory. The correspondence has been generalized in numerous ways, notably by Knuth to what is known as the Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence, and  a further generalization to pictures by Zelevinsky.","image":"e0314875955c9a8a16d29991e22fc2cec23e1cd4.svg","url":"Robinson–Schensted_correspondence"}
