{"title":"Mathematics education in the United States","summary":"From kindergarten through high school, mathematics education in public schools in the United States has historically varied widely from state to state, and often even varies considerably within individual states. There has been considerable disagreement on the style and contents of mathematics teaching, including the question of whether or not there should be any national standards at all.[1][2][3] Moreover, many students take alternatives to the traditional pathways, including accelerated tracks. As of 2023, twenty-seven states require students to pass three math courses before graduation from high school, but seventeen states and the District of Columbia require four.[4]","image":"Math_Workshop_Portland_7_(9610679810).jpg.webp","url":"Mathematics_education_in_the_United_States"}
