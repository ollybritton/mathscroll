{"title":"Matching (graph theory)","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, a matching or independent edge set in an undirected graph is a set of edges without common vertices.[1] In other words, a subset of the edges is a matching if each vertex appears in at most one edge of that matching. Finding a matching in a bipartite graph can be treated as a network flow problem.","image":"Maximal-matching.svg.png.webp","url":"Matching_(graph_theory)"}
