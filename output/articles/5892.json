{"title":"G-module","summary":"In mathematics, given a group G, a G-module is an abelian group M on which G acts compatibly with the abelian group structure on M. This widely applicable notion generalizes that of a representation of G. Group (co)homology provides an important set of tools for studying general G-modules.","image":"Toroidal_coord.png.webp","url":"G-module"}
