{"title":"Truncated octahedron","summary":"In geometry, the truncated octahedron is the Archimedean solid that arises from a regular octahedron by removing six pyramids, one at each of the octahedron's vertices. The truncated octahedron has 14 faces (8 regular hexagons and 6 squares), 36 edges, and 24 vertices. Since each of its faces has point symmetry the truncated octahedron is a 6-zonohedron. It is also the Goldberg polyhedron GIV(1,1), containing square and hexagonal faces. Like the cube, it can tessellate (or \"pack\") 3-dimensional space, as a permutohedron.","image":"Truncatedoctahedron.jpg.webp","url":"Truncated_octahedron"}
