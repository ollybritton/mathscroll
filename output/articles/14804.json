{"title":"Spieker circle","summary":"In geometry, the incircle of the medial triangle of a triangle is the Spieker circle, named after 19th-century German geometer Theodor Spieker.[1] Its center, the Spieker center, in addition to being the incenter of the medial triangle, is the center of mass of the uniform-density boundary of triangle.[1] The Spieker center is also the point where all three cleavers of the triangle (perimeter bisectors with an endpoint at a side's midpoint) intersect each other.[1]","image":"Spieker_circle.svg.png.webp","url":"Spieker_circle"}
