{"title":"Intersection curve","summary":"In geometry, an intersection curve is a curve that is common to two geometric objects. In the simplest case, the intersection of two non-parallel planes in Euclidean 3-space is a line. In general, an intersection curve consists of the common points of two transversally intersecting surfaces, meaning that at any common point the surface normals are not parallel. This restriction excludes cases where the surfaces are touching or have surface parts in common.","image":"Is-plane-plane-s.svg.png.webp","url":"Intersection_curve"}
