{"title":"Dodecahedral pyramid","summary":"In 4-dimensional geometry, the dodecahedral pyramid is bounded by one dodecahedron on the base and 12 pentagonal pyramid cells which meet at the apex. Since a dodecahedron's circumradius is greater than its edge length,[1] the pentagonal pyramids require tall isosceles triangle faces.","image":"Dodecahedral_pyramid.png.webp","url":"Dodecahedral_pyramid"}
