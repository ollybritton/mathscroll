{"title":"Scale analysis (mathematics)","summary":"Scale analysis (or order-of-magnitude analysis) is a powerful tool used in the mathematical sciences for the simplification of equations with many terms. First the approximate magnitude of individual terms in the equations is determined. Then some negligibly small terms may be ignored.","image":"BigOnotationfunctionapprox_popular.svg.png.webp","url":"Scale_analysis_(mathematics)"}
