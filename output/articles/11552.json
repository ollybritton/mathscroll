{"title":"Ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator","summary":"In applied mathematics – specifically in fuzzy logic – the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators provide a parameterized class of mean type aggregation operators. They were introduced by Ronald R. Yager. Many notable mean operators such as the max, arithmetic average, median and min, are members of this class. They have been widely used in computational intelligence because of their ability to model linguistically expressed aggregation instructions.","image":"eaf8b0f621a23f81aa20d63b5cd59d3dcad83ccb.svg","url":"Ordered_weighted_averaging_aggregation_operator"}
