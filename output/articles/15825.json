{"title":"Togliatti surface","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a Togliatti surface is a nodal surface of degree five with 31 nodes. The first examples were constructed by Eugenio G. Togliatti (1940). Arnaud Beauville (1980) proved that 31 is the maximum possible number of nodes for a surface of this degree, showing this example to be optimal.","image":"Togliatti_surface.png.webp","url":"Togliatti_surface"}
