{"title":"Hemi-icosahedron","summary":"A hemi-icosahedron is an abstract regular polyhedron, containing half the faces of a regular icosahedron. It can be realized as a projective polyhedron (a tessellation of the real projective plane by 10 triangles), which can be visualized by constructing the projective plane as a hemisphere where opposite points along the boundary are connected and dividing the hemisphere into three equal parts.","image":"Hemi-icosahedron2.png.webp","url":"Hemi-icosahedron"}
