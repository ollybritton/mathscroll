{"title":"Borel hierarchy","summary":"In mathematical logic, the Borel hierarchy is a stratification of the Borel algebra generated by the open subsets of a Polish space; elements of this algebra are called Borel sets.  Each Borel set is assigned a unique countable ordinal number called the rank of the Borel set. The Borel hierarchy is of particular interest in descriptive set theory.","image":"8608b1d906744b3ef6a47fb0f2629331e88133fb.svg","url":"Borel_hierarchy"}
