{"title":"Duodecimal","summary":"The duodecimal system (also known as base 12, dozenal, or, rarely, uncial) is a positional notation numeral system using twelve as its base. The number twelve (that is, the number written as \"12\" in the decimal numerical system) is instead written as \"10\" in duodecimal (meaning \"1 dozen and 0 units\", instead of \"1 ten and 0 units\"), whereas the digit string \"12\" means \"1 dozen and 2 units\" (decimal 14). Similarly, in duodecimal, \"100\" means \"1 gross\", \"1000\" means \"1 great gross\", and \"0.1\" means \"1 twelfth\" (instead of their decimal meanings \"1 hundred\", \"1 thousand\", and \"1 tenth\", respectively).","image":"Green_check.svg.png.webp","url":"Duodecimal"}
