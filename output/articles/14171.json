{"title":"Separoid","summary":"In mathematics, a separoid is a binary relation between disjoint sets which is stable as an ideal in the canonical order induced by inclusion. Many mathematical objects which appear to be quite different, find a common generalisation in the framework of separoids; e.g., graphs, configurations of convex sets, oriented matroids, and polytopes. Any countable category is an induced subcategory of separoids when they are endowed with homomorphisms[1] (viz., mappings that preserve the so-called minimal Radon partitions).","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Separoid"}
