{"title":"Hypercube","summary":"In geometry, a hypercube is an n-dimensional analogue of a square (n = 2) and a cube (n = 3). It is a closed, compact, convex figure whose 1-skeleton consists of groups of opposite parallel line segments aligned in each of the space's dimensions, perpendicular to each other and of the same length.  A unit hypercube's longest diagonal in n dimensions is equal to n {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {n}}} .","image":"2a2994734eae382ce30100fb17b9447fd8e99f81.svg","url":"Hypercube"}
