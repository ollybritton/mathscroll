{"title":"Subcategory","summary":"In mathematics, specifically category theory, a subcategory of a category C is a category S whose objects are objects in C and whose morphisms are morphisms in C with the same identities and composition of morphisms. Intuitively, a subcategory of C is a category obtained from C by \"removing\" some of its objects and arrows.","image":"a32ebca11afaaf6a1eb4bec974ff0a31f6ae1dde.svg","url":"Subcategory"}
