{"title":"Cover (topology)","summary":"In mathematics, and more particularly in set theory, a cover (or covering) of a set X {\\displaystyle X} is a family of subsets of X {\\displaystyle X} whose union is all of X {\\displaystyle X} . More formally, if C = { U α : α ∈ A } {\\displaystyle C=\\lbrace U_{\\alpha }:\\alpha \\in A\\rbrace } is an indexed family of subsets U α ⊂ X {\\displaystyle U_{\\alpha }\\subset X} (indexed by the set A {\\displaystyle A} ), then C {\\displaystyle C} is a cover of X {\\displaystyle X} if ⋃ α ∈ A U α = X {\\displaystyle \\bigcup _{\\alpha \\in A}U_{\\alpha }=X} . Thus the collection { U α : α ∈ A } {\\displaystyle \\lbrace U_{\\alpha }:\\alpha \\in A\\rbrace } is a cover of X {\\displaystyle X} if each element of X {\\displaystyle X} belongs to at least one of the subsets U α {\\displaystyle U_{\\alpha }} .","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Cover_(topology)"}
