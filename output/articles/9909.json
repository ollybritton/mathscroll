{"title":"Mapping cone (topology)","summary":"In mathematics, especially homotopy theory, the mapping cone is a construction C f {\\displaystyle C_{f}} of topology, analogous to a quotient space. It is also called the homotopy cofiber, and also notated C f {\\displaystyle Cf} . Its dual, a fibration, is called the mapping fibre. The mapping cone can be understood to be a mapping cylinder M f {\\displaystyle Mf} , with one end of the cylinder collapsed to a point. Thus, mapping cones are frequently applied in the homotopy theory of pointed spaces.","image":"7765fc9102a19771111a01cd0b18c79e231029cf.svg","url":"Mapping_cone_(topology)"}
