{"title":"Émery topology","summary":"In martingale theory, Émery topology is a topology on the space of semimartingales. The topology is used in financial mathematics. The class of stochastic integrals with general predictable integrands coincides with the closure of the set of all simple integrals.[1]","image":"c85e2ade272ea856d19ffebc7223dfb29be96bad.svg","url":"Émery_topology"}
