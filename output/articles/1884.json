{"title":"Bott–Samelson resolution","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the Bott–Samelson resolution of a Schubert variety is a resolution of singularities. It was introduced by Bott & Samelson (1958) in the context of compact Lie groups.[1] The algebraic formulation is independently due to Hansen (1973) and Demazure (1974).","image":"8943fd9739dd1d1ce27c6c2d00200c0601a460a4.svg","url":"Bott–Samelson_resolution"}
