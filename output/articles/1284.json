{"title":"Balanced ternary","summary":"Balanced ternary is a ternary numeral system (i.e. base 3 with three digits) that uses a balanced signed-digit representation of the integers in which the digits have the values âˆ’1, 0, and 1. This stands in contrast to the standard (unbalanced) ternary system, in which digits have values 0, 1 and 2. The balanced ternary system can represent all integers without using a separate minus sign; the value of the leading non-zero digit of a number has the sign of the number itself. The balanced ternary system is an example of a non-standard positional numeral system. It was used in some early computers[1] and also in some solutions of balance puzzles.[2]","image":"ed525b93bf294538e4252b31cc93182d3444609b.svg","url":"Balanced_ternary"}
