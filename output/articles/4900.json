{"title":"Equational logic","summary":"First-order equational logic consists of quantifier-free terms of ordinary first-order logic, with equality as the only predicate symbol. The model theory of this logic was developed into universal algebra by Birkhoff, Gr√§tzer, and Cohn. It was later made into a branch of category theory by Lawvere (\"algebraic theories\").[1]","image":"39259cf5f0aa09389d66ca1fb1796820e753af2a.svg","url":"Equational_logic"}
