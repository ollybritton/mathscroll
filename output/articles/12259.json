{"title":"Point reflection","summary":"In geometry, a point reflection (point inversion, central inversion, or inversion through a point) is a type of isometry of Euclidean space. An object that is invariant under a point reflection is said to possess point symmetry; if it is invariant under point reflection through its center, it is said to possess central symmetry or to be centrally symmetric.","image":"Cyclic_symmetry_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Point_reflection"}
