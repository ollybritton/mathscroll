{"title":"Conway base 13 function","summary":"The Conway base 13 function is a function created by British mathematician John H. Conway as a counterexample to the converse of the intermediate value theorem. In other words, it is a function that satisfies a particular intermediate-value property—on any interval (a, b), the function f takes every value between f(a) and f(b)—but is not continuous.","image":"1e3a10a3ad05781f5cf9c2d875a02227e21a8448.svg","url":"Conway_base_13_function"}
