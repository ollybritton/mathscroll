{"title":"Continuous dual q-Hahn polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the continuous dual q-Hahn polynomials  are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme. Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties.","image":"56e6cddf91187d4260e29a7a4820033b42bc225a.svg","url":"Continuous_dual_q-Hahn_polynomials"}
