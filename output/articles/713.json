{"title":"Amenable group","summary":"In mathematics, an amenable group is a locally compact topological group G carrying a kind of averaging operation on bounded functions that is invariant under translation by group elements. The original definition, in terms of a finitely additive measure (or mean) on subsets of G, was introduced by John von Neumann in 1929 under the German name \"messbar\" (\"measurable\" in English) in response to the Banachâ€“Tarski paradox. In 1949 Mahlon M. Day introduced the English translation \"amenable\", apparently as a pun on \"mean\".[lower-alpha 1]","image":"c730667ff3da7b08989f251916d841cbcb6a4349.svg","url":"Amenable_group"}
