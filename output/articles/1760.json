{"title":"Block LU decomposition","summary":"In linear algebra, a Block LU decomposition is a matrix decomposition of a block matrix into a lower block triangular matrix L and an upper block triangular matrix U. This decomposition is used in numerical analysis to reduce the complexity of the block matrix formula.","image":"064bf58095d9594d8b4300a7e5da6a876c6835bb.svg","url":"Block_LU_decomposition"}
