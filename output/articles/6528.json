{"title":"Great hexagonal hexecontahedron","summary":"In geometry, the great hexagonal hexecontahedron (or great astroid ditriacontahedron) is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron. It is the dual of the uniform great snub dodecicosidodecahedron. It is partially degenerate, having coincident vertices, as its dual has coplanar pentagrammic faces.","image":"DU64_great_hexagonal_hexecontahedron.png.webp","url":"Great_hexagonal_hexecontahedron"}
