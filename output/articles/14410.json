{"title":"Simplicial commutative ring","summary":"In algebra, a simplicial commutative ring is a commutative monoid in the category of simplicial abelian groups, or, equivalently, a simplicial object in the category of commutative rings. If A is a simplicial commutative ring, then it can be shown that π 0 A {\\displaystyle \\pi _{0}A} is a ring and π i A {\\displaystyle \\pi _{i}A} are modules over that ring (in fact, π ∗ A {\\displaystyle \\pi _{*}A} is a graded ring over π 0 A {\\displaystyle \\pi _{0}A} .)","image":"bc1471daed6b40feff7012f55bebaaf318f909b0.svg","url":"Simplicial_commutative_ring"}
