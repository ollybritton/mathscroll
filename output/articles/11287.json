{"title":"Numeracy","summary":"Numeracy is the ability to understand, reason with, and to apply simple numerical concepts.[1] The charity National Numeracy states: \"Numeracy means understanding how mathematics is used in the real world and being able to apply it to make the best possible decisions...Itâ€™s as much about thinking and reasoning as about 'doing sums'\". Basic numeracy skills consist of comprehending fundamental arithmetical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, if one can understand simple mathematical equations such as 2 + 2 = 4, then one would be considered to possess at least basic numeric knowledge. Substantial aspects of numeracy also include number sense, operation sense, computation, measurement, geometry, probability and statistics. A numerically literate person can manage and respond to the mathematical demands of life.[2][3]","image":"Math_games_-_Big_Brother_Mouse_activity_day.jpg.webp","url":"Numeracy"}
