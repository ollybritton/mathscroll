{"title":"Big M method","summary":"In operations research, the Big M method is a method of solving linear programming problems using the simplex algorithm.  The Big M method extends the simplex algorithm to problems that contain \"greater-than\" constraints. It does so by associating the constraints with large negative constants which would not be part of any optimal solution, if it exists.","image":"ca6d4f45d4d6302c2785bfbfb461956f6bc0a6e0.svg","url":"Big_M_method"}
