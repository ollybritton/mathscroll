{"title":"Quasi-sphere","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical physics, a quasi-sphere is a generalization of the hypersphere and the hyperplane to the context of a pseudo-Euclidean space.  It may be described as the set of points for which the quadratic form for the space applied to the displacement vector from a centre point is a constant value, with the inclusion of hyperplanes as a limiting case.","image":"15bb600c1516b6eb09d263ee565ff6d0a20b4cf0.svg","url":"Quasi-sphere"}
