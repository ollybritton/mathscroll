{"title":"Knot complement","summary":"In mathematics, the knot complement of a tame knot K is the space where the knot is not. If a knot is embedded in the 3-sphere, then the complement is the 3-sphere minus the space near the knot. To make this precise, suppose that K is a knot in a three-manifold M (most often, M is the  3-sphere).  Let N be a tubular neighborhood of K; so N is a solid torus.  The knot complement is then the complement of N,","image":"3ad064436a91cc974aa1a2ded065ed58d82c325d.svg","url":"Knot_complement"}
