{"title":"Orthogonal convex hull","summary":"In geometry, a set K âŠ‚ Rd is defined to be orthogonally convex if, for every line L that is parallel to one of standard basis vectors, the intersection of K with L is empty, a point, or a single segment. The term \"orthogonal\" refers to corresponding Cartesian basis and coordinates in Euclidean space, where different basis vectors are perpendicular, as well as corresponding lines. Unlike ordinary convex sets, an orthogonally convex set is not necessarily connected.","image":"Orthogonal-convex-hull.svg.png.webp","url":"Orthogonal_convex_hull"}
