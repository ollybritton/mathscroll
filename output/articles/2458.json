{"title":"Chain complex","summary":"In mathematics, a chain complex is an algebraic structure that consists of a sequence of abelian groups (or modules) and a sequence of homomorphisms between consecutive groups such that the image of each homomorphism is included in the kernel of the next. Associated to a chain complex is its homology, which describes how the images are included in the kernels.","image":"34e17fb870590ecf2315850f64ea8c17a195c1a7.svg","url":"Chain_complex"}
