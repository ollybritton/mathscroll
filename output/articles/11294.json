{"title":"Numerical digit","summary":"A numerical digit (often shortened to just digit) is a single symbol used alone (such as \"2\") or in combinations (such as \"25\"), to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. The name \"digit\" comes from the fact that the ten digits (Latin digiti meaning fingers)[1] of the hands correspond to the ten symbols of the common baseÂ 10 numeral system, i.e. the decimal (ancient Latin adjective decem meaning ten)[2] digits.","image":"Hindu-Arabic_numerals.svg.png.webp","url":"Numerical_digit"}
