{"title":"Point group","summary":"In geometry, a point group is a mathematical group of symmetry operations (isometries in a Euclidean space) that have a fixed point in common. The coordinate origin of the Euclidean space is conventionally taken to be a fixed point, and every point group in dimension d is then a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(d). Point groups are used to describe the  symmetries of geometric figures and physical objects such as molecules.","image":"Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg.png.webp","url":"Point_group"}
