{"title":"Product (category theory)","summary":"In category theory, the product of two (or more) objects in a category is a notion designed to capture the essence behind constructions in other areas of mathematics such as the Cartesian product of sets, the direct product of groups or rings, and the product of topological spaces. Essentially, the product of a family of objects is the \"most general\" object which admits a morphism to each of the given objects.","image":"067be67e68f60c53ce83241748d0d6249675c58d.svg","url":"Product_(category_theory)"}
