{"title":"Divisorial scheme","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a divisorial scheme is a scheme admitting an ample family of line bundles, as opposed to an ample line bundle. In particular, a quasi-projective variety is a divisorial scheme and the notion is a generalization of \"quasi-projective\". It was introduced in (Borelli 1963) (in the case of a variety) as well as in (SGA 6, Expos√© II, 2.2.) (in the case of a scheme). The term \"divisorial\" refers to the fact that \"the topology of these varieties is determined by their positive divisors.\"[1] The class of divisorial schemes is quite large: it includes affine schemes, separated regular (noetherian) schemes and subschemes of a divisorial scheme (such as projective varieties).","image":"4e3670304a05f5edb061f87405c27a33dfb1a918.svg","url":"Divisorial_scheme"}
