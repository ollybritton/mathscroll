{"title":"Magnus expansion","summary":"In mathematics and physics, the Magnus expansion, named after Wilhelm Magnus (1907â€“1990), provides an exponential representation of the solution of a first-order homogeneous linear differential equation for a linear operator. In particular, it furnishes the fundamental matrix of a system of linear ordinary differential equations of order n with varying coefficients. The exponent is aggregated as an infinite series, whose terms involve multiple integrals and nested commutators.","image":"ed046999f5b21bcbbdd55b566ab5a58be72cd484.svg","url":"Magnus_expansion"}
