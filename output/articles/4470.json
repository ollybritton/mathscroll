{"title":"Dragon curve","summary":"A dragon curve is any member of a family of self-similar fractal curves, which can be approximated by recursive methods such as Lindenmayer systems. The dragon curve is probably most commonly thought of as the shape that is generated from repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half, although there are other curves that are called dragon curves that are generated differently.","image":"Fractal_dragon_curve.jpg.webp","url":"Dragon_curve"}
