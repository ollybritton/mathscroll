{"title":"Narayana number","summary":"In combinatorics, the Narayana numbers N ⁡ ( n , k ) , n ∈ N + , 1 ≤ k ≤ n {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {N} (n,k),n\\in \\mathbb {N} ^{+},1\\leq k\\leq n} form a triangular array of natural numbers, called the Narayana triangle, that occur in various counting problems. They are named after Canadian mathematician T. V. Narayana (1930–1987).","image":"af3c683c0a8b89c802bff68f9d3d65f832761635.svg","url":"Narayana_number"}
