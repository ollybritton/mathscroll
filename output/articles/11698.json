{"title":"POVM","summary":"In functional analysis and quantum measurement theory, a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) is a measure whose values are positive semi-definite operators on a Hilbert space. POVMs are a generalization of projection-valued measures (PVM) and, correspondingly, quantum measurements described by POVMs are a generalization of quantum measurement described by PVMs (called projective measurements).","image":"a16ebacac98f91296d70fbf635d86447a1acae86.svg","url":"POVM"}
