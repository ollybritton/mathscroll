{"title":"Self-similar process","summary":"Self-similar processes are types of stochastic processes that exhibit the phenomenon of self-similarity. A self-similar phenomenon behaves the same when viewed at different degrees of magnification, or different scales on a dimension (space or time). Self-similar processes can sometimes be described using heavy-tailed distributions, also known as long-tailed distributions.  Examples of such processes include traffic processes, such as packet inter-arrival times and burst lengths. Self-similar processes can exhibit long-range dependency.","image":"673d742a6286779fc8a609e1986336afffb14136.svg","url":"Self-similar_process"}
