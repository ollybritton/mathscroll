{"title":"Fundamental class","summary":"In mathematics, the fundamental class is a homology class [M] associated to a connected orientable compact manifold of dimension n, which corresponds to the generator of the homology group H n ( M , ∂ M ; Z ) ≅ Z {\\displaystyle H_{n}(M,\\partial M;\\mathbf {Z} )\\cong \\mathbf {Z} } . The fundamental class can be thought of as the orientation of the top-dimensional simplices of a suitable triangulation of the manifold.","image":"7d7dfa67d1b4c7f7c7a04c41dc4fc4a94b492dae.svg","url":"Fundamental_class"}
