{"title":"Kolmogorov's normability criterion","summary":"In mathematics, Kolmogorov's normability criterion is a theorem that provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a topological vector space to be normable; that is, for the existence of a norm on the space that generates the given topology.[1][2] The normability criterion can be seen as a result in same vein as the Nagataâ€“Smirnov metrization theorem and Bing metrization theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a topological space to be metrizable.  The result was proved by the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolayevich Kolmogorov in 1934.[3][4][5]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Kolmogorov's_normability_criterion"}
