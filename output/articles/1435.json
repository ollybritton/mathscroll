{"title":"Bellman equation","summary":"A Bellman equation, named after Richard E. Bellman, is a necessary condition for optimality associated with the mathematical optimization method known as dynamic programming.[1] It writes the \"value\" of a decision problem at a certain point in time in terms of the payoff from some initial choices and the \"value\" of the remaining decision problem that results from those initial choices. This breaks a dynamic optimization problem into a sequence of simpler subproblems, as Bellman's â€œprinciple of optimality\" prescribes.[2]  The equation applies to algebraic structures with a total ordering; for algebraic structures with a partial ordering, the generic Bellman's equation can be used.[3]","image":"Bellman_flow_chart.png.webp","url":"Bellman_equation"}
