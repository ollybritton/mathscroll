{"title":"Snark (graph theory)","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a snark is an undirected graph with exactly three edges per vertex whose edges cannot be colored with only three colors. In order to avoid trivial cases, snarks are often restricted to have additional requirements on their connectivity and on the length of their cycles. Infinitely many snarks exist.","image":"Petersen1_tiny.svg.png.webp","url":"Snark_(graph_theory)"}
