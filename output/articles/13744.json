{"title":"Round-robin item allocation","summary":"Round robin is a procedure for fair item allocation. It can be used to allocate several indivisible items among several people, such that the allocation is \"almost\" envy-free: each agent believes that the bundle he received is at least as good as the bundle of any other agent, when at most one item is removed from the other bundle. In sports, the round-robin procedure is called a draft.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Round-robin_item_allocation"}
