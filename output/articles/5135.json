{"title":"Exchange matrix","summary":"In mathematics, especially linear algebra, the exchange matrices (also called the reversal matrix, backward identity, or standard involutory permutation) are special cases of permutation matrices, where the 1 elements reside on the antidiagonal and all other elements are zero. In other words, they are 'row-reversed' or 'column-reversed' versions of the identity matrix.[1]","image":"63d261d59e537d80974a79a52990f4c61dda0438.svg","url":"Exchange_matrix"}
