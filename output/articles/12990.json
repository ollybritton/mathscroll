{"title":"Quotient of an abelian category","summary":"In mathematics, the quotient (also called Serre quotient or Gabriel quotient) of an abelian category A {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}} by a Serre subcategory B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}} is the abelian category A / B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}/{\\mathcal {B}}} which, intuitively, is obtained from A {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}} by ignoring (i.e. treating as zero) all objects from B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}} .  There is a canonical exact functor Q : A â†’ A / B {\\displaystyle Q\\colon {\\mathcal {A}}\\to {\\mathcal {A}}/{\\mathcal {B}}} whose kernel is B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}} , and A / B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}/{\\mathcal {B}}} is in a certain sense the most general abelian category with this property.","image":"280ae03440942ab348c2ca9b8db6b56ffa9618f8.svg","url":"Quotient_of_an_abelian_category"}
