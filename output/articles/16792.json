{"title":"Weeks manifold","summary":"In mathematics, the Weeks manifold, sometimes called the Fomenko–Matveev–Weeks manifold, is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold obtained by (5, 2) and (5, 1) Dehn surgeries on the Whitehead link.  It has volume approximately equal to 0.942707… (OEIS: A126774) and David Gabai, Robert Meyerhoff, and Peter Milley (2009) showed that it has the smallest  volume of any closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold.  The manifold was independently discovered by Jeffrey Weeks (1985) as well as  Sergei V. Matveev and Anatoly T. Fomenko (1988).","image":"4d996ad071b6d1a176bf0d033c16a7d6b0967400.svg","url":"Weeks_manifold"}
