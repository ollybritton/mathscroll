{"title":"Action (physics)","summary":"In physics, action is a scalar quantity describing how a physical system has changed over time. Action is significant because the equations of motion of the system can be derived through the principle of stationary action.","image":"e206b59f649a82ce5bf6f145a7a7839003426f21.svg","url":"Action_(physics)"}
