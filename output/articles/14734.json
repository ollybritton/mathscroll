{"title":"Spectrahedron","summary":"In convex geometry, a spectrahedron is a shape that can be represented as a linear matrix inequality. Alternatively, the set of n × n positive semidefinite matrices forms a convex cone in Rn × n, and a spectrahedron is a shape that can be formed by intersecting this cone with a linear affine subspace.","image":"S_asdf_rot.png.webp","url":"Spectrahedron"}
