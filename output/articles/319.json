{"title":"Acceleration (differential geometry)","summary":"In mathematics and physics, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of a curve with respect to a given linear connection. This operation provides us with a measure of the rate and direction of the \"bend\".[1][2]","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Acceleration_(differential_geometry)"}
