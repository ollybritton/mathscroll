{"title":"Suspension of a ring","summary":"In algebra, more specifically in algebraic K-theory, the suspension Σ R {\\displaystyle \\Sigma R} of a ring R is given by[1] Σ ( R ) = C ( R ) / M ( R ) {\\displaystyle \\Sigma (R)=C(R)/M(R)} where C ( R ) {\\displaystyle C(R)} is the ring of all infinite matrices with coefficients in R having only finitely many nonzero elements in each row or column and M ( R ) {\\displaystyle M(R)} is its ideal of matrices having only finitely many nonzero elements. It is an analog of suspension in topology.","image":"380746e599d5db29c29206b9923648a7470bc859.svg","url":"Suspension_of_a_ring"}
