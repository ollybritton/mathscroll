{"title":"Diophantine geometry","summary":"In mathematics, Diophantine geometry is the study of Diophantine equations by means of powerful methods in algebraic geometry. By the 20th century it became clear for some mathematicians that methods of algebraic geometry are ideal tools to study these equations.[1] Diophantine geometry is part of the broader field of arithmetic geometry.","image":"Stereographic_projection_in_3D.svg.png.webp","url":"Diophantine_geometry"}
