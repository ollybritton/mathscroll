{"title":"Zappa–Szép product","summary":"In mathematics, especially group theory, the Zappa–Szép product (also known as the Zappa–Rédei–Szép product, general product, knit product, exact factorization or bicrossed product) describes a way in which a group can be constructed from two subgroups. It is a generalization of the direct and semidirect products.  It is named after Guido Zappa (1940) and Jenő Szép (1950) although it was independently studied by others including B.H. Neumann (1935), G.A. Miller (1935), and J.A. de Séguier (1904).[1]","image":"045c9a5dde8c40750964efef61f9f30314109abf.svg","url":"Zappa–Szép_product"}
