{"title":"Grönwall's inequality","summary":"In mathematics, Grönwall's inequality (also called Grönwall's lemma or the Grönwall–Bellman inequality) allows one to bound a function that is known to satisfy a certain differential or integral inequality by the solution of the corresponding differential or integral equation. There are two forms of the lemma, a differential form and an integral form. For the latter there are several variants.","image":"7282208efc98a33a189cf81b298959a7e866ebfd.svg","url":"Grönwall's_inequality"}
