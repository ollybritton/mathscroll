{"title":"Euler–Maruyama method","summary":"In Itô calculus, the Euler–Maruyama method (also called the Euler method) is a method for the approximate numerical solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE). It is an extension of the Euler method for ordinary differential equations to stochastic differential equations. It is named after Leonhard Euler and Gisiro Maruyama. Unfortunately, the same generalization cannot be done for any arbitrary deterministic method.[1]","image":"823fe4fd490a3124c091a81727d96080fa9ed09f.svg","url":"Euler–Maruyama_method"}
