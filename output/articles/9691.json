{"title":"Long line (topology)","summary":"In topology, the long line (or Alexandroff line) is a topological space somewhat similar to the real line, but in a certain way \"longer\".  It behaves locally just like the real line, but has different large-scale properties (e.g., it is neither Lindel√∂f nor separable). Therefore, it serves as an important counterexample in topology.[1] Intuitively, the usual real-number line consists of a countable number of line segments [ 0 , 1 ) {\\displaystyle [0,1)} laid end-to-end, whereas the long line is constructed from an uncountable number of such segments.","image":"0f99b30b4451167959e97802252ad13b87af5505.svg","url":"Long_line_(topology)"}
