{"title":"Computational hardness assumption","summary":"In computational complexity theory, a computational hardness assumption is the hypothesis that a particular problem cannot be solved efficiently (where efficiently typically means \"in polynomial time\"). It is not known how to prove (unconditional) hardness for essentially any useful problem. Instead, computer scientists rely on reductions to formally relate the hardness of a new or complicated problem to a computational hardness assumption about a problem that is better-understood.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Computational_hardness_assumption"}
