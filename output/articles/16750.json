{"title":"Watts–Strogatz model","summary":"The Watts–Strogatz model is a random graph generation model that produces graphs with small-world properties, including short average path lengths and high clustering. It was proposed by Duncan J. Watts and Steven Strogatz in their article published in 1998 in the Nature scientific journal.[1] The model also became known as the (Watts) beta model after Watts used β {\\displaystyle \\beta } to formulate it in his popular science book Six Degrees.","image":"7ed48a5e36207156fb792fa79d29925d2f7901e8.svg","url":"Watts–Strogatz_model"}
