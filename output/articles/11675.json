{"title":"p-adic L-function","summary":"In mathematics, a p-adic zeta function, or more generally a p-adic L-function, is a function analogous to the Riemann zeta function, or more general L-functions, but whose domain and target are p-adic (where p is a prime number). For example, the domain could be the p-adic integers Zp, a profinite p-group, or a p-adic family of Galois representations, and the image could be the p-adic numbers Qp or its algebraic closure.","image":"5063329a3da41b983ad6313a365eab80feeccfbb.svg","url":"P-adic_L-function"}
