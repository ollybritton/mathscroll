{"title":"Elongated square cupola","summary":"In geometry, the elongated square cupola is one of the Johnson solids (J19). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a square cupola (J4) by attaching an octagonal prism to its base. The solid can be seen as a rhombicuboctahedron with its \"lid\" (another square cupola) removed.","image":"Elongated_square_cupola.png.webp","url":"Elongated_square_cupola"}
