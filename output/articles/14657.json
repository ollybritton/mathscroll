{"title":"Solid set","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, a subset S {\\displaystyle S} of a vector lattice is said to be solid and is called an ideal if for all s ∈ S {\\displaystyle s\\in S} and x ∈ X , {\\displaystyle x\\in X,} if | x | ≤ | s | {\\displaystyle |x|\\leq |s|} then x ∈ S . {\\displaystyle x\\in S.} An ordered vector space whose order is Archimedean is said to be Archimedean ordered.[1] If S ⊆ X {\\displaystyle S\\subseteq X} then the ideal generated by S {\\displaystyle S} is the smallest ideal in X {\\displaystyle X} containing S . {\\displaystyle S.} An ideal generated by a singleton set is called a principal ideal in X . {\\displaystyle X.}","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Solid_set"}
