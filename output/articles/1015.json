{"title":"Arnold–Givental conjecture","summary":"The Arnold–Givental conjecture, named after Vladimir Arnold and Alexander Givental, is a statement on Lagrangian submanifolds. It gives a lower bound in terms of the Betti numbers of a Lagrangian submanifold L on the number of intersection points of L with another Lagrangian submanifold which is obtained from L by Hamiltonian isotopy, and which intersects L transversally.","image":"d343da33a65bc6b0682b8da9ba31e5af966ce9eb.svg","url":"Arnold–Givental_conjecture"}
