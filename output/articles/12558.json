{"title":"Probability measure","summary":"In mathematics, a probability measure is a real-valued function defined on a set of events in a probability space that satisfies measure properties such as countable additivity.[1]  The difference between a probability measure and the more general notion of measure (which includes concepts like area or volume) is that a probability measure must assign value 1 to the entire probability space.","image":"Standard_deviation_diagram_micro.svg.png.webp","url":"Probability_measure"}
