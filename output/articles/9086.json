{"title":"Law of total variance","summary":"In probability theory, the law of total variance[1] or variance decomposition formula or conditional variance formulas or law of iterated variances also known as Eve's law,[2] states that if X {\\displaystyle X} and Y {\\displaystyle Y} are random variables on the same probability space, and the variance of Y {\\displaystyle Y} is finite, then","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Law_of_total_variance"}
