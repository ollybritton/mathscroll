{"title":"Nondeterministic Turing machine","summary":"In theoretical computer science, a nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM) is a theoretical model of computation whose governing rules specify more than one possible action when in some given situations. That is, an NTM's next state is not completely determined by its action and the current symbol it sees, unlike a deterministic Turing machine.","image":"Difference_between_deterministic_and_Nondeterministic.svg.png.webp","url":"Nondeterministic_Turing_machine"}
