{"title":"Medcouple","summary":"In statistics, the medcouple is a robust statistic that measures the skewness of a univariate distribution.[1]  It is defined as a scaled median difference between the left and right half of a distribution. Its robustness makes it suitable for identifying outliers in adjusted boxplots.[2][3] Ordinary box plots do not fare well with skew distributions, since they label the longer unsymmetrical tails as outliers. Using the medcouple, the whiskers of a boxplot can be adjusted for skew distributions and thus have a more accurate identification of outliers for non-symmetrical distributions.","image":"Medcouple-distribution.png.webp","url":"Medcouple"}
