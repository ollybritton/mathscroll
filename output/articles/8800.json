{"title":"Komlós' theorem","summary":"Komlós' theorem is a theorem from probability theory and mathematical analysis about the Cesàro convergence of a subsequence of random variables (or functions) and their subsequences to an integrable random variable (or function). It's also an existence theorem for an integrable random variable (or function). There exist a probabilistic and an analytical version for finite measure spaces.","image":"9d77104a5c3c49cc0634dcf6908db7ad45f738d2.svg","url":"Komlós'_theorem"}
