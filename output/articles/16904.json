{"title":"Wiener deconvolution","summary":"In mathematics, Wiener deconvolution is an application of the Wiener filter to the noise problems inherent in deconvolution. It works in the frequency domain, attempting to minimize the impact of deconvolved noise at frequencies which have a poor signal-to-noise ratio.","image":"Image_restoration_(motion_blur%2C_Wiener_filtering).png.webp","url":"Wiener_deconvolution"}
