{"title":"General relativity","summary":"General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity and Einstein's theory of gravity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime. In particular, the .mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#b1d2ff}curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of second order partial differential equations.","image":"Spacetime_lattice_analogy.svg.png.webp","url":"General_relativity"}
