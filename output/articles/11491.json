{"title":"Order-5 hexagonal tiling honeycomb","summary":"In the field of hyperbolic geometry, the order-5 hexagonal tiling honeycomb arises as one of 11 regular paracompact honeycombs in 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. It is paracompact because it has cells composed of an infinite number of faces.  Each cell consists of a hexagonal tiling whose vertices lie on a horosphere, a flat plane in hyperbolic space that approaches a single ideal point at infinity.","image":"H3_635_FC_boundary.png.webp","url":"Order-5_hexagonal_tiling_honeycomb"}
