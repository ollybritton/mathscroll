{"title":"Interval predictor model","summary":"In regression analysis, an interval predictor model (IPM) is an approach to regression where bounds on the function to be approximated are obtained. This differs from other techniques in machine learning, where usually one wishes to estimate point values or an entire probability distribution. Interval Predictor Models are sometimes referred to as a nonparametric regression technique, because a potentially infinite set of functions are contained by the IPM, and no specific distribution is implied for the regressed variables.","image":"9dc5c09b7dd280b2fb0e938075fa46acef33ccff.svg","url":"Interval_predictor_model"}
