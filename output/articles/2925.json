{"title":"Commutator collecting process","summary":"In group theory, a branch of mathematics, the commutator collecting process is a method for writing an element of a group as a product of generators and their higher commutators arranged in a certain order. The commutator collecting process was introduced by Philip Hall in 1934[1] and articulated by Wilhelm Magnus in 1937.[2]  The process is sometimes called a \"collection process\".","image":"1150864b654db740ba241a6b7f52a05dceea8d64.svg","url":"Commutator_collecting_process"}
