{"title":"Dependent random choice","summary":"In mathematics, dependent random choice is a probabilistic technique that shows how to find a large set of vertices in a dense graph such that every small subset of vertices has many common neighbors. It is a useful tool to embed a graph into another graph with many edges. Thus it has its application in extremal graph theory, additive combinatorics and Ramsey theory.","image":"92981a56c22049dd6a915e1f1acc237785b2eb4c.svg","url":"Dependent_random_choice"}
