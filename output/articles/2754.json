{"title":"Clifford module bundle","summary":"In differential geometry, a Clifford module bundle, a bundle of Clifford modules or just Clifford module is a vector bundle whose fibers are Clifford modules, the representations of Clifford algebras. The canonical example is a spinor bundle.[1][2] In fact, on a Spin manifold, every Clifford module is obtained by twisting the spinor bundle.[3]","image":"0a19630ec57b2ca80baf087a7fb30c7a6d6938b5.svg","url":"Clifford_module_bundle"}
