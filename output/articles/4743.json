{"title":"Elliptic-curve cryptography","summary":"Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC allows smaller keys compared to non-EC cryptography (based on plain Galois fields) to provide equivalent security.[1]","image":"2d35035371db7bee93733c68c1802114c17d8bb4.svg","url":"Elliptic-curve_cryptography"}
