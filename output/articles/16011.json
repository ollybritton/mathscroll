{"title":"Trefoil knot","summary":"In knot theory, a branch of mathematics, the trefoil knot is the simplest example of a nontrivial knot. The trefoil can be obtained by joining together the two loose ends of a common overhand knot, resulting in a knotted loop. As the simplest knot, the trefoil is fundamental to the study of mathematical knot theory.","image":"Blue_Trefoil_Knot_Animated.gif","url":"Trefoil_knot"}
