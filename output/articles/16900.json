{"title":"Wieferich prime","summary":"In number theory, a Wieferich prime is a prime number p such that p2 divides 2p − 1 − 1,[4] therefore connecting these primes with Fermat's little theorem, which states that every odd prime p divides 2p − 1 − 1. Wieferich primes were first described by Arthur Wieferich in 1909 in works pertaining to Fermat's Last Theorem, at which time both of Fermat's theorems were already well known to mathematicians.[5][6]","image":"7bd23e0dc8312c56c0e3584017637f9fc4ebb014.svg","url":"Wieferich_prime"}
