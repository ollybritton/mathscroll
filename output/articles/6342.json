{"title":"Goat grazing problem","summary":"The goat grazing problem is either of two related problems in recreational mathematics involving a tethered goat grazing a circular area: the interior grazing problem and the exterior grazing problem. The former involves grazing the interior of a circular area, and the latter, grazing an exterior of a circular area. For the exterior problem, the constraint that the rope can not enter the circular area dictates that the grazing area forms an involute. If the goat were instead tethered to a post on the edge of a circular path of pavement that did not obstruct the goat (rather than a fence or a silo), the interior and exterior problem would be complements of a simple circular area.","image":"Involute_of_circle_of_radius_r.jpg.webp","url":"Goat_grazing_problem"}
