{"title":"Congruence (general relativity)","summary":"In general relativity, a congruence (more properly, a congruence of curves) is the set of integral curves of a (nowhere vanishing) vector field in a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold which is interpreted physically as a model of spacetime.  Often this manifold will be taken to be an exact or approximate solution to the Einstein field equation.","image":"5dc35b5a0226cf11a2c3f2d2dbbac6ab5ade6036.svg","url":"Congruence_(general_relativity)"}
