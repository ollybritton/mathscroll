{"title":"Degree (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, the degree (or valency) of a vertex of a graph is the number of edges that are incident to the vertex; in a multigraph, a loop contributes 2 to a vertex's degree, for the two ends of the edge.[1] The degree of a vertex v {\\displaystyle v} is denoted deg ⁡ ( v ) {\\displaystyle \\deg(v)} or deg ⁡ v {\\displaystyle \\deg v} . The maximum degree of a graph G {\\displaystyle G} , denoted by Δ ( G ) {\\displaystyle \\Delta (G)} , and the minimum degree of a graph, denoted by δ ( G ) {\\displaystyle \\delta (G)} , are the maximum and minimum of its vertices' degrees. In the multigraph shown on the right, the maximum degree is 5 and the minimum degree is 0.","image":"e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597.svg","url":"Degree_(graph_theory)"}
