{"title":"Arnoldi iteration","summary":"In numerical linear algebra, the Arnoldi iteration is an eigenvalue algorithm and an important example of an iterative method.  Arnoldi finds an approximation to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general (possibly non-Hermitian) matrices by constructing an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace, which makes it particularly useful when dealing with large sparse matrices.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Arnoldi_iteration"}
