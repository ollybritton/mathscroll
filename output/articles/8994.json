{"title":"Landau set","summary":"In voting systems, the Landau set (or uncovered set, or Fishburn set) is the set of candidates x {\\displaystyle x} such that for every other candidate z {\\displaystyle z} , there is some candidate y {\\displaystyle y} (possibly the same as x {\\displaystyle x} or z {\\displaystyle z} ) such that y {\\displaystyle y} is not preferred to x {\\displaystyle x} and z {\\displaystyle z} is not preferred to y {\\displaystyle y} .  In notation, x {\\displaystyle x} is in the Landau set if ∀ z {\\displaystyle \\forall \\,z} , ∃ y {\\displaystyle \\exists \\,y} , x ≥ y ≥ z {\\displaystyle x\\geq y\\geq z} .","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Landau_set"}
