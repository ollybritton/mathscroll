{"title":"Geometric separator","summary":"A geometric separator is a line (or another shape) that partitions a collection of geometric shapes into two subsets, such that proportion of shapes in each subset is bounded, and the number of shapes that do not belong to any subset (i.e. the shapes intersected by the separator itself) is small.","image":"Hyperplane×‚GeometricSeparatorCounterExample.svg.png.webp","url":"Geometric_separator"}
