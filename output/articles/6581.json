{"title":"Grid bracing","summary":"In the mathematics of structural rigidity, grid bracing is a problem of adding cross bracing to a square grid to make it into a rigid structure. It can be solved optimally by translating it into a problem in graph theory on the connectivity of bipartite graphs.[1][2][3]","image":"Grid-flex.svg.png.webp","url":"Grid_bracing"}
