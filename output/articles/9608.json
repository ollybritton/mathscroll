{"title":"Local invariant cycle theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the local invariant cycle theorem was originally a conjecture of Griffiths [1][2] which states that, given a surjective proper map p {\\displaystyle p} from a Kähler manifold X {\\displaystyle X} to the unit disk that has maximal rank everywhere except over 0, each cohomology class on p − 1 ( t ) , t ≠ 0 {\\displaystyle p^{-1}(t),t\\neq 0} is the restriction of some cohomology class on the entire X {\\displaystyle X} if the cohomology class is invariant under a circle action (monodromy action); in short,","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Local_invariant_cycle_theorem"}
