{"title":"Logical framework","summary":"In logic, a logical framework provides a means to define (or present) a logic as a signature in a higher-order type theory in such a way that provability of a formula in the original logic reduces to a type inhabitation problem in the framework type theory.[1][2] This approach has been used successfully for (interactive) automated theorem proving. The first logical framework was Automath; however, the name of the idea comes from the more widely known Edinburgh Logical Framework, LF. Several more recent proof tools like Isabelle are based on this idea.[1] Unlike a direct embedding, the logical framework approach allows many logics to be embedded in the same type system.[3]","image":"790acb3275cae6852dea98dece8c1afa460df68a.svg","url":"Logical_framework"}
