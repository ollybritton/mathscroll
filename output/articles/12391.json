{"title":"Position (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a position or position vector, also known as location vector or radius vector, is a Euclidean vector that represents the position of a point P in space in relation to an arbitrary reference origin O. Usually denoted x, r, or s, it corresponds to the straight line segment from O to P. In other words, it is the displacement or translation that maps the origin to P:[1]","image":"21c0b7638841581f30d4957e120db73aae7adb16.svg","url":"Position_(geometry)"}
