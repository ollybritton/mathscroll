{"title":"Satake diagram","summary":"In the mathematical study of Lie algebras and Lie groups, a Satake diagram is a generalization of a Dynkin diagram introduced by Satake (1960, p.109) whose configurations classify simple Lie algebras over the field of real numbers. The Satake diagrams associated to a Dynkin diagram classify real forms of the complex Lie algebra corresponding to the Dynkin diagram.","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Satake_diagram"}
