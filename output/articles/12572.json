{"title":"Product integral","summary":"A product integral is any product-based counterpart of the usual sum-based integral of calculus. The first product integral (Type I below) was developed by the mathematician Vito Volterra in 1887 to solve systems of linear differential equations.[1][2] Other examples of product integrals are the geometric integral (Type II below), the bigeometric integral (Type III below), and some other integrals of non-Newtonian calculus.[3][4][5]","image":"a90a03f5558eba2072a554f4fc0e5c01f6b20a24.svg","url":"Product_integral"}
