{"title":"Sherman–Morrison formula","summary":"In mathematics, in particular linear algebra, the Sherman–Morrison formula,[1][2][3] named after Jack Sherman and Winifred J. Morrison, computes the inverse of the sum of an invertible matrix A {\\displaystyle A} and the outer product, u v T {\\displaystyle uv^{\\textsf {T}}} , of vectors u {\\displaystyle u} and v {\\displaystyle v} . The Sherman–Morrison formula is a special case of the Woodbury formula.  Though named after Sherman and Morrison, it appeared already in earlier publications.[4]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Sherman–Morrison_formula"}
