{"title":"Realization (systems)","summary":"In systems theory, a realization of a state space model is an  implementation of a given input-output behavior.  That is, given an input-output relationship, a realization is a quadruple of (time-varying) matrices [ A ( t ) , B ( t ) , C ( t ) , D ( t ) ] {\\displaystyle [A(t),B(t),C(t),D(t)]} such that","image":"a1c55ec426914614e3d3002474a585242249efed.svg","url":"Realization_(systems)"}
