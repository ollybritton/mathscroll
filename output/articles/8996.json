{"title":"Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation","summary":"In physics, the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation, named for Lev Landau, Evgeny Lifshitz, and T. L. Gilbert, is a name used for a differential equation describing the precessional motion of  magnetization M in a solid. It is a modification by Gilbert of the original equation of Landau and Lifshitz.","image":"Damped_Magnetization_Precession.jpg.webp","url":"Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert_equation"}
