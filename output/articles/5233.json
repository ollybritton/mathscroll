{"title":"F-algebra","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in category theory, F-algebras generalize the notion of algebraic structure. Rewriting the algebraic laws in terms of morphisms eliminates all references to quantified elements from the axioms, and these algebraic laws may then be glued together in terms of a single functor F, the signature.","image":"F_algebra.svg.png.webp","url":"F-algebra"}
