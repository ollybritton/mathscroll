{"title":"G2 (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, G2 is the name of three simple Lie groups (a complex form, a compact real form and a split real form), their Lie algebras g 2 , {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}_{2},} as well as some algebraic groups. They are the smallest of the five exceptional simple Lie groups. G2 has rank 2 and dimension 14. It has two fundamental representations, with dimension 7 and 14.","image":"50c7a6c9c1f92c9a7ba9b4db08bae266328069dd.svg","url":"G2_(mathematics)"}
