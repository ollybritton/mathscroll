{"title":"Absorbing set (random dynamical systems)","summary":"In mathematics, an absorbing set for a random dynamical system is a subset of the phase space. A dynamical system is a system in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space.","image":"f8b94a882bbe3bc5b30ed6f1bf16c60c823effeb.svg","url":"Absorbing_set_(random_dynamical_systems)"}
