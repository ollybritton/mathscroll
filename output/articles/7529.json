{"title":"Hyperoctahedral group","summary":"In mathematics, a hyperoctahedral group is an important type of group that can be realized as the group of symmetries of a hypercube or of a cross-polytope. It was named by Alfred Young in 1930. Groups of this type are identified by a parameter n, the dimension of the hypercube.","image":"C2_group_circle_domains.png.webp","url":"Hyperoctahedral_group"}
