{"title":"Fubini's theorem on differentiation","summary":"In mathematics, Fubini's theorem on differentiation, named after Guido Fubini, is a result in real analysis concerning the differentiation of series of monotonic functions. It can be proven by using Fatou's lemma and the properties of null sets.[1]","image":"a7884f4699a56d7aaae2bedf0062c57bab1050ba.svg","url":"Fubini's_theorem_on_differentiation"}
