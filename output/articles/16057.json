{"title":"Tricolorability","summary":"In the mathematical field of knot theory, the tricolorability of a knot is the ability of a knot to be colored with three colors subject to certain rules.  Tricolorability is an isotopy invariant, and hence can be used to distinguish between two different (non-isotopic) knots.  In particular, since the unknot is not tricolorable, any tricolorable knot is necessarily nontrivial.","image":"Tricoloring.png.webp","url":"Tricolorability"}
