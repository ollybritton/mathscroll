{"title":"Weyl–Brauer matrices","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in the theory of spinors, the Weyl–Brauer matrices are an explicit realization of a Clifford algebra as a matrix algebra of 2⌊n/2⌋ × 2⌊n/2⌋ matrices. They generalize the Pauli matrices to n dimensions, and are a specific construction of higher-dimensional gamma matrices. They are named for Richard Brauer and Hermann Weyl,[1] and were one of the earliest systematic constructions of spinors from a representation theoretic standpoint.","image":"fe867f4c916d4125ab75b7e20085205d71a03082.svg","url":"Weyl–Brauer_matrices"}
