{"title":"Order-5 tesseractic honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 4-space, the order-5 tesseractic honeycomb is one of five compact regular space-filling tessellations (or honeycombs). With Schl√§fli symbol {4,3,3,5}, it has five 8-cells (also known as tesseracts) around each face. Its dual is the order-4 120-cell honeycomb, {5,3,3,4}.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Order-5_tesseractic_honeycomb"}
