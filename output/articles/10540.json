{"title":"Mitchell's group","summary":"In mathematics, Mitchell's group is a complex reflection group in 6 complex dimensions of order 108 × 9!, introduced by Mitchell (1914). It has the structure 6.PSU4(F3).2. As a complex reflection group it has 126 reflections of order 2, and its ring of invariants is a polynomial algebra with generators of degrees 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 42. Coxeter gives it group symbol [1 2 3]3 and Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .[1]","image":"CDel_node.png.webp","url":"Mitchell's_group"}
