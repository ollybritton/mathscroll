{"title":"Gaussian rational","summary":"In mathematics, a Gaussian rational number is a complex number of the form p + qi, where p and q are both rational numbers. The set of all Gaussian rationals forms the Gaussian rational field, denoted Q(i), obtained by adjoining the imaginary number i to the field of rationals Q.","image":"d207003fe316ebadc00de228a4e93ea13bec2fa5.svg","url":"Gaussian_rational"}
