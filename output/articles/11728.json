{"title":"Pairwise compatibility graph","summary":"In graph theory, a graph G {\\displaystyle G} is a pairwise compatibility graph (PCG) if there exists a tree T {\\displaystyle T} and two non-negative real numbers d m i n < d m a x {\\displaystyle d_{min}<d_{max}} such that each node u ′ {\\displaystyle u'} of G {\\displaystyle G} has a one-to-one mapping with a leaf node u {\\displaystyle u} of T {\\displaystyle T} such that two nodes u ′ {\\displaystyle u'} and v ′ {\\displaystyle v'} are adjacent in G {\\displaystyle G} if and only if the distance between u {\\displaystyle u} and v {\\displaystyle v} are in the interval [ d m i n , d m a x ] {\\displaystyle [d_{min},d_{max}]} .[1]","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Pairwise_compatibility_graph"}
