{"title":"Grothendieck space","summary":"In mathematics, a Grothendieck space, named after Alexander Grothendieck, is a Banach space X {\\displaystyle X} in which every sequence in its continuous dual space X ′ {\\displaystyle X^{\\prime }} that converges in the weak-* topology σ ( X ′ , X ) {\\displaystyle \\sigma \\left(X^{\\prime },X\\right)} (also known as the topology of pointwise convergence) will also converge when X ′ {\\displaystyle X^{\\prime }} is endowed with σ ( X ′ , X ′ ′ ) , {\\displaystyle \\sigma \\left(X^{\\prime },X^{\\prime \\prime }\\right),} which is the weak topology induced on X ′ {\\displaystyle X^{\\prime }} by its bidual. Said differently, a Grothendieck space is a Banach space for which a sequence in its dual space converges weak-* if and only if it converges weakly.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Grothendieck_space"}
