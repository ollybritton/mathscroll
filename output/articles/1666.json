{"title":"Binomial theorem","summary":"In elementary algebra, the binomial theorem (or binomial expansion) describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial. According to the theorem, it is possible to expand the polynomial (x + y)n into a sum involving terms of the form axbyc, where the exponents b and c are nonnegative integers with b + c = n, and the coefficient a of each term is a specific positive integer depending on n and b.  For example, for n = 4,","image":"ebd0ade2ebe2cf6c1b2a7084b3b5cbf0b8e3a77b.svg","url":"Binomial_theorem"}
