{"title":"Shelling (topology)","summary":"In mathematics, a shelling of a simplicial complex is a way of gluing it together from its maximal simplices (simplices that are not a face of another simplex) in a well-behaved way. A complex admitting a shelling is called shellable.","image":"32769037c408874e1890f77554c65f39c523ebe2.svg","url":"Shelling_(topology)"}
