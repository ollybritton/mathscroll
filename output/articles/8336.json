{"title":"John E. Osborn (mathematician)","summary":"John E. Osborn (July 12, 1936 â€“ May 30, 2011)[1] was an American mathematician. He obtained B.S. (1958), M.S. (1963), and Ph.D. (1965) degrees at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. His Ph.D. adviser was Hans Weinberger.  Osborn made fundamental contributions to computational mathematics, especially to the theory of numerical solution of partial differential equations, eigenvalue approximations, and the finite element method.  He also co-authored several textbooks on differential equations and numerical computation with the goal of introducing computation into sophomore level differential equations courses.","image":"John_E._Osborn_photo_Apr_2009_by_James_A._Yorke.jpg.webp","url":"John_E._Osborn_(mathematician)"}
