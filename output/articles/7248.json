{"title":"Hilbert projection theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Hilbert projection theorem is a famous result of convex analysis that says that for every vector x {\\displaystyle x} in a Hilbert space H {\\displaystyle H} and every nonempty closed convex C ⊆ H , {\\displaystyle C\\subseteq H,} there exists a unique vector m ∈ C {\\displaystyle m\\in C} for which ‖ c − x ‖ {\\displaystyle \\|c-x\\|} is minimized over the vectors c ∈ C {\\displaystyle c\\in C} ; that is, such that ‖ m − x ‖ ≤ ‖ c − x ‖ {\\displaystyle \\|m-x\\|\\leq \\|c-x\\|} for every c ∈ C . {\\displaystyle c\\in C.}","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Hilbert_projection_theorem"}
