{"title":"Aurifeuillean factorization","summary":"In number theory, an aurifeuillean factorization, named after Léon-François-Antoine Aurifeuille, is a special type of algebraic factorization that comes from non-trivial factorizations of cyclotomic polynomials over the integers.[1] Although cyclotomic polynomials themselves are irreducible over the integers, when restricted to particular integer values they may have an algebraic factorization, as in the examples below.","image":"ea5115f9467c7346192f7cc991de1d1d1fd288e6.svg","url":"Aurifeuillean_factorization"}
