{"title":"Euler brick","summary":"In mathematics, an Euler brick, named after Leonhard Euler, is a rectangular cuboid whose edges and face diagonals all have integer lengths. A primitive Euler brick is an Euler brick whose edge lengths are relatively prime. A perfect Euler brick is one whose space diagonal is also an integer but such a brick has not yet been found.","image":"Euler_brick.svg.png.webp","url":"Euler_brick"}
