{"title":"Vitali set","summary":"In mathematics, a Vitali set is an elementary example of a set of real numbers that is not Lebesgue measurable, found by Giuseppe Vitali in 1905.[1] The Vitali theorem is the existence theorem that there are such sets. There are uncountably many Vitali sets, and their existence depends on the axiom of choice. In 1970, Robert Solovay constructed a model of Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice where all sets of real numbers are Lebesgue measurable, assuming the existence of an inaccessible cardinal (see Solovay model).[2]","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Vitali_set"}
