{"title":"Connection (affine bundle)","summary":"Let Y → X be an affine bundle modelled over a vector bundle Y → X. A connection Γ on Y → X is called the affine connection if it as a section Γ : Y → J1Y of the jet bundle J1Y → Y of Y is an affine bundle morphism over X. In particular, this is an affine connection on the tangent bundle TX of a smooth manifold X. (That is, the connection on an affine bundle is an example of an affine connection; it is not, however, a general definition of an affine connection.  These are related but distinct concepts both unfortunately making use of the adjective \"affine\".)","image":"23e02cb65142cba117e766b19d91fa20fe2b2298.svg","url":"Connection_(affine_bundle)"}
