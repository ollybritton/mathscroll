{"title":"Connection (principal bundle)","summary":"In mathematics, and especially differential geometry and gauge theory, a connection is a device that defines a notion of parallel transport on the bundle; that is, a way to \"connect\" or identify fibers over nearby points. A principal G-connection on a principal G-bundle P over a smooth manifold M is a particular type of connection which is compatible with the action of the group G.","image":"Principal_bundle_connection_form_projection.png.webp","url":"Connection_(principal_bundle)"}
