{"title":"Polynomial functor","summary":"In algebra, a polynomial functor is an endofunctor on the category V {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {V}}} of finite-dimensional vector spaces that depends polynomially on vector spaces. For example, the symmetric powers V ↦ Sym n ⁡ ( V ) {\\displaystyle V\\mapsto \\operatorname {Sym} ^{n}(V)} and the exterior powers V ↦ ∧ n ( V ) {\\displaystyle V\\mapsto \\wedge ^{n}(V)} are polynomial functors from V {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {V}}} to V {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {V}}} ; these two are also Schur functors.","image":"47d69f309b6deb2e5008f6130ee11e09bbabd7b6.svg","url":"Polynomial_functor"}
