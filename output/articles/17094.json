{"title":"Young symmetrizer","summary":"In mathematics, a Young symmetrizer is an element of the  group algebra of the symmetric group, constructed in such a way that, for the homomorphism from the group algebra to the endomorphisms of a vector space V ⊗ n {\\displaystyle V^{\\otimes n}} obtained from the action of S n {\\displaystyle S_{n}} on V ⊗ n {\\displaystyle V^{\\otimes n}} by permutation of indices, the image of the endomorphism determined by that element corresponds to an irreducible representation of the symmetric group over the complex numbers. A similar construction works over any field, and the resulting representations are called Specht modules. The Young symmetrizer is named after British mathematician Alfred Young.","image":"ae04a5f6f3c7b6bc96ecbcac5f4eb67bc6e8221a.svg","url":"Young_symmetrizer"}
