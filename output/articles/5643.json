{"title":"Fractional factorial design","summary":"In statistics, fractional factorial designs are experimental designs consisting of a carefully chosen subset (fraction) of the experimental runs of a full factorial design.[1] The subset is chosen so as to exploit the sparsity-of-effects principle to expose information about the most important features of the problem studied, while using a fraction of the effort of a full factorial design in terms of experimental runs and resources. In other words, it makes use of the fact that many experiments in full factorial design are often redundant, giving little or no new information about the system.","image":"04bd52ce670743d3b61bec928a7ec9f47309eb36.svg","url":"Fractional_factorial_design"}
