{"title":"Johnson's algorithm","summary":"Johnson's algorithm is a way to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in an edge-weighted directed graph. It allows some of the edge weights to be negative numbers, but no negative-weight cycles may exist. It works by using the Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm to compute a transformation of the input graph that removes all negative weights, allowing Dijkstra's algorithm to be used on the transformed graph.[1][2] It is named after Donald B. Johnson, who first published the technique in 1977.[3]","image":"fb710833bfcdc985b76d7594d0e7998c182dabe9.svg","url":"Johnson's_algorithm"}
