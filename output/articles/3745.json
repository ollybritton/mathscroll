{"title":"Dagger compact category","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, dagger compact categories (or dagger compact closed categories) first appeared in 1989 in the work of  Sergio Doplicher and John E. Roberts on the reconstruction of compact topological groups from their category of finite-dimensional continuous unitary representations (that is, Tannakian categories).[1]  They also appeared in the work of John Baez and James Dolan as an instance of semistrict k-tuply monoidal n-categories, which describe general topological quantum field theories,[2] for n = 1 and k = 3.  They are a fundamental structure in Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke's categorical quantum mechanics.[3][4][5]","image":"11de80478fce9090e43eed19100b37cc841661e8.svg","url":"Dagger_compact_category"}
