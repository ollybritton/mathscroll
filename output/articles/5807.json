{"title":"Fulkerson–Chen–Anstee theorem","summary":"The Fulkerson–Chen–Anstee theorem is a result in graph theory, a branch of combinatorics. It provides one of two known approaches solving the digraph realization problem, i.e. it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for pairs of nonnegative integers ( ( a 1 , b 1 ) , … , ( a n , b n ) ) {\\displaystyle ((a_{1},b_{1}),\\ldots ,(a_{n},b_{n}))} to be the indegree-outdegree pairs of a simple directed graph; a sequence obeying these conditions is called \"digraphic\". D. R. Fulkerson[1] (1960) obtained a characterization analogous to the classical Erdős–Gallai theorem for graphs, but in contrast to this solution with exponentially many inequalities. In 1966 Chen [2] improved this result in demanding the additional constraint that the integer pairs must be sorted in non-increasing lexicographical order leading to n inequalities. Anstee [3] (1982) observed in a different context that it is sufficient to have a 1 ≥ ⋯ ≥ a n {\\displaystyle a_{1}\\geq \\cdots \\geq a_{n}} . Berger [4] reinvented this result and gives a direct proof.","image":"a97b189689f29f42ff7f4c330399c8b89474dd39.svg","url":"Fulkerson–Chen–Anstee_theorem"}
