{"title":"Radon–Nikodym theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Radon–Nikodym theorem is a result in measure theory that expresses the relationship between two measures defined on the same measurable space. A measure is a set function that assigns a consistent magnitude to the measurable subsets of a measurable space. Examples of a measure include area and volume, where the subsets are sets of points; or the probability of an event, which is a subset of possible outcomes within a wider probability space.","image":"4f9e27e6557ad895cd2526df181cc28bc9040116.svg","url":"Radon–Nikodym_theorem"}
