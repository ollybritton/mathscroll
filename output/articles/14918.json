{"title":"Standard complex","summary":"In mathematics, the standard complex, also called standard resolution, bar resolution, bar complex, bar construction, is a way of constructing resolutions in homological algebra.  It was first introduced for the special case of algebras over a commutative ring by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane (1953) and Henri Cartan and Eilenberg (1956, IX.6) and has since been generalized in many ways.","image":"de29098f5a34ee296a505681a0d5e875070f2aea.svg","url":"Standard_complex"}
