{"title":"Quadrilateral","summary":"In  geometry  a quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon, having four edges (sides) and four corners (vertices). The word is derived from the Latin words quadri, a variant of four, and latus, meaning \"side\". It is also called a tetragon, derived from greek \"tetra\" meaning \"four\" and \"gon\" meaning \"corner\" or \"angle\", in analogy to other polygons (e.g. pentagon). Since \"gon\" means \"angle\", it is analogously called a quadrangle, or 4-angle. A quadrilateral with vertices A {\\displaystyle A} , B {\\displaystyle B} , C {\\displaystyle C} and D {\\displaystyle D} is sometimes denoted as â—» A B C D {\\displaystyle \\square ABCD} .[1]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Quadrilateral"}
