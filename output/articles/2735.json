{"title":"Clausen function","summary":"In mathematics, the Clausen function, introduced by Thomas ClausenÂ (1832), is a transcendental, special function of a single variable. It can variously be expressed in the form of a definite integral, a trigonometric series, and various other forms. It is intimately connected with the polylogarithm, inverse tangent integral, polygamma function, Riemann zeta function, Dirichlet eta function, and Dirichlet beta function.","image":"Mplwp_Clausen.svg.png.webp","url":"Clausen_function"}
