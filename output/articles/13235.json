{"title":"Recurrence relation","summary":"In mathematics, a recurrence relation is an equation according to which the n {\\displaystyle n} th term of a sequence of numbers is equal to some combination of the previous terms. Often, only k {\\displaystyle k} previous terms of the sequence appear in the equation, for a parameter k {\\displaystyle k} that is independent of n {\\displaystyle n} ; this number k {\\displaystyle k} is called the order of the relation. If the values of the first k {\\displaystyle k} numbers in the sequence have been given, the rest of the sequence can be calculated by repeatedly applying the equation.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Recurrence_relation"}
