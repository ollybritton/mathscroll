{"title":"Seiberg–Witten invariants","summary":"In mathematics, and especially gauge theory, Seiberg–Witten invariants are invariants of compact smooth oriented 4-manifolds introduced by Edward Witten (1994), using the Seiberg–Witten theory studied by Nathan Seiberg and  Witten (1994a, 1994b) during their investigations of Seiberg–Witten gauge theory.","image":"d1282daf514bd6d13c801c3266082646b747d845.svg","url":"Seiberg–Witten_invariants"}
