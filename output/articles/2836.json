{"title":"Cofree coalgebra","summary":"In algebra, the cofree coalgebra of a vector space or module is a coalgebra analog of the free algebra of a vector space. The cofree coalgebra of any vector space over a field exists, though it is more complicated than one might expect by analogy with the free algebra.","image":"a5d25a49d4c823c7a50c770c4d4e53d40a1705e2.svg","url":"Cofree_coalgebra"}
