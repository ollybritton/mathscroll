{"title":"Cayley transform","summary":"In mathematics, the Cayley transform, named after Arthur Cayley, is any of a cluster of related things. As originally described by Cayley (1846), the Cayley transform is a mapping between skew-symmetric matrices and special orthogonal matrices. The transform is a homography used in real analysis, complex analysis, and quaternionic analysis. In the theory of Hilbert spaces, the Cayley transform is a mapping between linear operators (Nikolski 1988).","image":"915c20c6fc77968179590b4cf68c0fb84d8cce82.svg","url":"Cayley_transform"}
