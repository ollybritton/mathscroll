{"title":"Frugal number","summary":"In number theory, a frugal number is a natural number in a given number base that has more digits than the number of digits in its prime factorization in the given number base (including exponents).[1] For example, in base 10, 125 = 53, 128 = 27, 243 = 35, and 256 = 28 are frugal numbers (sequence A046759 in the OEIS). The first frugal number which is not a prime power is 1029 = 3 Ã— 73. In base 2, thirty-two is a frugal number, since 32 = 25 is written in base 2 as 100000 = 10101.","image":"0041c936812fb809c4511e31eb0404de9d48511b.svg","url":"Frugal_number"}
