{"title":"Bicrossed product of Hopf algebra","summary":"In quantum group and Hopf algebra, the bicrossed product is a process to create new Hopf algebras from the given ones. It's motivated by the Zappa–Szép product of groups. It was first discussed by M. Takeuchi in 1981,[1] and now a general tool for construction of Drinfeld quantum double.[2][3]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Bicrossed_product_of_Hopf_algebra"}
