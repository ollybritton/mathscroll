{"title":"Direct limit","summary":"In mathematics, a direct limit is a way to construct a (typically large) object from many (typically smaller) objects that are put together in a specific way. These objects may be groups, rings, vector spaces or in general objects from any category.  The way they are put together is specified by a system of homomorphisms (group homomorphism, ring homomorphism, or in general morphisms in the category) between those smaller objects. The direct limit of the objects A i {\\displaystyle A_{i}} , where i {\\displaystyle i} ranges over some directed set I {\\displaystyle I} , is denoted by lim → ⁡ A i {\\displaystyle \\varinjlim A_{i}} . (This is a slight abuse of notation as it suppresses the system of homomorphisms that is crucial for the structure of the limit.)","image":"1aed3b5def921afbe6cc48aaf8f9b11c6f1c1e2d.svg","url":"Direct_limit"}
