{"title":"Equations defining abelian varieties","summary":"In mathematics, the concept of abelian variety is the higher-dimensional generalization of the elliptic curve. The equations defining abelian varieties are a topic of study because every abelian variety is a projective variety. In dimension d â‰¥ 2, however, it is no longer as straightforward to discuss such equations.","image":"a55d4997048bf28597a3df0e5957ca952931c444.svg","url":"Equations_defining_abelian_varieties"}
