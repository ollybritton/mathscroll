{"title":"Iterated function system","summary":"In mathematics, iterated function systems (IFSs) are a method of constructing fractals; the resulting fractals are often self-similar. IFS fractals are more related to set theory than fractal geometry.[1] They were introduced in 1981.","image":"Sierpinski1.png.webp","url":"Iterated_function_system"}
