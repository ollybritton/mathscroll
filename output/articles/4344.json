However, this usage, though widespread in some  countries, is not universal; it is used for other purposes in other countries and its use to denote division is not recommended in the ISO 80000-2 standard for mathematical notation.[1]","image":"Skjermbilete_2012-11-03_kl._02.48.36.png.webp","url":"Division_sign"}
