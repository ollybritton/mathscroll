{"title":"Type I and type II errors","summary":"In statistical hypothesis testing, a type I error is the mistaken rejection of an actually true null hypothesis (also known as a \"false positive\" finding or conclusion; example: \"an innocent person is convicted\"), while a type II error is the failure to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false (also known as a \"false negative\" finding or conclusion; example: \"a guilty person is not convicted\").[1] Much of statistical theory revolves around the minimization of one or both of these errors, though the complete elimination of either is a statistical impossibility if the outcome is not determined by a known, observable causal process. By selecting a low threshold (cut-off) value and modifying the alpha (Î±) level, the quality of the hypothesis test can be increased. The knowledge of type I errors and type II errors is widely used in medical science, biometrics and computer science.","image":"ROC_curves.svg.png.webp","url":"Type_I_and_type_II_errors"}
