{"title":"Outer product","summary":"In linear algebra, the outer product of two coordinate vectors is a matrix. If the two vectors have dimensions n and m, then their outer product is an n Ã— m matrix. More generally, given two tensors (multidimensional arrays of numbers), their outer product is a tensor. The outer product of tensors is also referred to as their tensor product, and can be used to define the tensor algebra.","image":"7f7ea91d81567531f5ef6d3b669be211ff953e6a.svg","url":"Outer_product"}
