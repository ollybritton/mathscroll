{"title":"Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem","summary":"The Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem (Polish spelling is Sochocki) is a theorem in complex analysis, which helps in evaluating certain integrals. The real-line version of it (see below) is often used in physics, although rarely referred to by name. The theorem is named after Julian Sochocki, who proved it in 1868, and Josip Plemelj, who rediscovered it as a main ingredient of his solution of the Riemann–Hilbert problem in 1908.","image":"33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e.svg","url":"Sokhotski–Plemelj_theorem"}
