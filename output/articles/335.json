{"title":"Actuarial credentialing and exams","summary":"The actuarial credentialing and exam process usually requires passing a rigorous series of professional examinations, most often taking several years in total, before one can become recognized as a credentialed actuary. In some countries, such as Denmark, most study takes place in a university setting. In others, such as the U.S., most study takes place during employment through a series of examinations. In the UK, and countries based on its process, there is a hybrid university-exam structure.","image":"729028ad4f1e6be6059c631c525a7ce8d08c1565.svg","url":"Actuarial_credentialing_and_exams"}
