{"title":"All one polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, an all one polynomial (AOP) is a polynomial in which all coefficients are one. Over the finite field of order two, conditions for the AOP to be irreducible are known, which allow this polynomial to be used to define efficient algorithms and circuits for multiplication in finite fields of characteristic two.[1] The AOP is a 1-equally spaced polynomial.[2]","image":"37150d28c68b647b57d1f5e591df6c8da856722e.svg","url":"All_one_polynomial"}
