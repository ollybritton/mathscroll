{"title":"Fox derivative","summary":"In mathematics, the Fox derivative is an algebraic construction in the theory of free groups which bears many similarities to the conventional derivative of calculus. The Fox derivative and related concepts are often referred to as the Fox calculus, or (Fox's original term) the free differential calculus. The Fox derivative was developed in a series of five papers by mathematician Ralph Fox, published in Annals of Mathematics beginning in 1953.","image":"7fa93dea01ad761f04c69f6a422f19a8df325617.svg","url":"Fox_derivative"}
