{"title":"Schur–Horn theorem","summary":"In mathematics, particularly linear algebra, the Schur–Horn theorem, named after Issai Schur and Alfred Horn, characterizes the diagonal of a Hermitian matrix with given eigenvalues. It has inspired investigations and substantial generalizations in the setting of symplectic geometry. A few important generalizations are Kostant's convexity theorem, Atiyah–Guillemin–Sternberg convexity theorem, Kirwan convexity theorem.","image":"b2512562652816e6b93613c3f8c96f8cc2c8ffb4.svg","url":"Schur–Horn_theorem"}
