{"title":"Perfect number","summary":"In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.","image":"Perfect_number_Cuisenaire_rods_6.png.webp","url":"Perfect_number"}
