{"title":"Skew-symmetric graph","summary":"In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, a skew-symmetric graph is a directed graph that is isomorphic to its own transpose graph, the graph formed by reversing all of its edges, under an isomorphism that is an involution without any fixed points.  Skew-symmetric graphs are identical to the double covering graphs of bidirected graphs.","image":"Implication_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Skew-symmetric_graph"}
