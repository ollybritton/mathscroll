{"title":"Quasi-compact morphism","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a morphism f : X → Y {\\displaystyle f:X\\to Y} between schemes is said to be quasi-compact if Y can be covered by open affine subschemes V i {\\displaystyle V_{i}} such that the pre-images f − 1 ( V i ) {\\displaystyle f^{-1}(V_{i})} are quasi-compact (as topological space).[1] If f is quasi-compact, then the pre-image of a quasi-compact open subscheme (e.g., open affine subscheme) under f is quasi-compact.","image":"abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c.svg","url":"Quasi-compact_morphism"}
