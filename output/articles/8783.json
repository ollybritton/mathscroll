{"title":"Kodaira vanishing theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Kodaira vanishing theorem is a basic result of complex manifold theory and complex algebraic geometry, describing general conditions under which sheaf cohomology groups with indices q > 0 are automatically zero. The implications for the group with index q = 0 is usually that its dimension — the number of independent global sections — coincides with a holomorphic Euler characteristic that can be computed using the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem.","image":"35e7989746c10f8d4b5608f6878d3b96b9864485.svg","url":"Kodaira_vanishing_theorem"}
