{"title":"Anabelian geometry","summary":"Anabelian geometry is a theory in number theory which describes the way in which the algebraic fundamental group G of a certain arithmetic variety X, or some related geometric object, can help to restore X. The first results for number fields and their absolute Galois groups were obtained by Jürgen Neukirch, Masatoshi Gündüz Ikeda, Kenkichi Iwasawa, and  Kôji Uchida (Neukirch–Uchida theorem, 1969) prior to conjectures made about hyperbolic curves over number fields by  Alexander Grothendieck. As introduced in Esquisse d'un Programme the latter were about how topological homomorphisms between two arithmetic fundamental groups of two hyperbolic curves over number fields correspond to maps between the curves. These Grothendieck conjectures  were partially solved by Hiroaki Nakamura and Akio Tamagawa, while complete proofs were given by Shinichi Mochizuki.","image":"5093a5134f8340579c83fd5b9606c23953a7842c.svg","url":"Anabelian_geometry"}
