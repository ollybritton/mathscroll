{"title":"Jacobi form","summary":"In mathematics, a Jacobi form is an automorphic form on the Jacobi group, which is the semidirect product of the symplectic group Sp(n;R) and the Heisenberg group H R ( n , h ) {\\displaystyle H_{R}^{(n,h)}} . The theory  was first systematically studied by Eichler & Zagier (1985).","image":"c9cd3cc6b6ebd7e3595c2bb2cf228f8a539a9e46.svg","url":"Jacobi_form"}
