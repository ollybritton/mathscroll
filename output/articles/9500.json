{"title":"List of knot theory topics","summary":"Knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. While inspired by knots which appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician's knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone.  In precise mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R3.  Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg","url":"List_of_knot_theory_topics"}
