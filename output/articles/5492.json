{"title":"Fisher kernel","summary":"In statistical classification, the Fisher kernel, named after Ronald Fisher, is a function that measures the similarity of two objects on the basis of sets of measurements for each object and a statistical model. In a classification procedure, the class for a new object (whose real class is unknown) can be estimated by minimising, across classes, an average of the Fisher kernel distance from the new object to each known member of the given class.","image":"c28cf1c1a3ae93a61ccfd684bdc59c8f1566de28.svg","url":"Fisher_kernel"}
