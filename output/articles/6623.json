{"title":"Group extension","summary":"In mathematics, a group extension is a general means of describing a group in terms of a particular normal subgroup and quotient group.  If Q {\\displaystyle Q} and N {\\displaystyle N} are two groups, then G {\\displaystyle G} is an extension of Q {\\displaystyle Q} by N {\\displaystyle N} if there is a short exact sequence","image":"8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed.svg","url":"Group_extension"}
