{"title":"Tangent indicatrix","summary":"In differential geometry, the tangent indicatrix of a closed space curve is a curve on the unit sphere intimately related to the curvature of the original curve. Let γ ( t ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (t)} be a closed curve with nowhere-vanishing tangent vector γ ˙ {\\displaystyle {\\dot {\\gamma }}} . Then the tangent indicatrix T ( t ) {\\displaystyle T(t)} of γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } is the closed curve on the unit sphere given by T = γ ˙ | γ ˙ | {\\displaystyle T={\\frac {\\dot {\\gamma }}{|{\\dot {\\gamma }}|}}} .","image":"54fa4a5d64e164410e4a18106677bebefe1a1f1b.svg","url":"Tangent_indicatrix"}
