{"title":"Convex layers","summary":"In computational geometry, the convex layers of a set of points in the Euclidean plane are a sequence of nested convex polygons having the points as their vertices. The outermost one is the convex hull of the points and the rest are formed in the same way recursively. The innermost layer may be degenerate, consisting only of one or two points.[1] The problem of constructing convex layers has also been called onion peeling or onion decomposition.[2]","image":"Convex_layers_halfspace.svg.png.webp","url":"Convex_layers"}
