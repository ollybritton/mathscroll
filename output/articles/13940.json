{"title":"Scherk surface","summary":"In mathematics, a Scherk surface (named after Heinrich Scherk) is an example of a minimal surface. Scherk described two complete embedded minimal surfaces in 1834;[1] his first surface is a doubly periodic surface, his second surface is singly periodic. They were the third non-trivial examples of minimal surfaces (the first two were the catenoid and helicoid).[2] The two surfaces are conjugates of each other.","image":"Scherkassociatefamily.gif","url":"Scherk_surface"}
