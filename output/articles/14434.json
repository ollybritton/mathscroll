{"title":"Sine-Gordon equation","summary":"The sine-Gordon equation is a nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation in 1 + 1 dimensions involving the d'Alembert operator and the sine of the unknown function. It was originally introduced by Edmond Bour (1862) in the course of study of surfaces of constant negative curvature as the Gauss–Codazzi equation for surfaces of curvature −1 in 3-space,[1] and rediscovered by Frenkel and Kontorova (1939) in their study of crystal dislocations known as the Frenkel–Kontorova model.[2] This equation attracted a lot of attention in the 1970s due to the presence of soliton solutions.","image":"dc58b170649144a87a5d6a9fb7e182a1c8789f06.svg","url":"Sine-Gordon_equation"}
