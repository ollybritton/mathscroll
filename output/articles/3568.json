{"title":"Cross-polytope","summary":"In geometry, a cross-polytope,[1] hyperoctahedron, orthoplex,[2] or cocube is a regular, convex polytope that exists in n-dimensional Euclidean space. A 2-dimensional cross-polytope is a square, a 3-dimensional cross-polytope is a regular octahedron, and a 4-dimensional cross-polytope is a 16-cell. Its facets are simplexes of the previous dimension, while the cross-polytope's vertex figure is another cross-polytope from the previous dimension.","image":"2-orthoplex.svg.png.webp","url":"Cross-polytope"}
