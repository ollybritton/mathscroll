{"title":"Common graph","summary":"In graph theory, an area of mathematics, common graphs belong to a branch of extremal graph theory concerning inequalities in homomorphism densities. Roughly speaking, F {\\displaystyle F} is a common graph if it \"commonly\" appears as a subgraph, in a sense that the total number of copies of F {\\displaystyle F} in any graph G {\\displaystyle G} and its complement G ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\overline {G}}} is a large fraction of all possible copies of F {\\displaystyle F} on the same vertices. Intuitively, if G {\\displaystyle G} contains few copies of F {\\displaystyle F} , then its complement G ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\overline {G}}} must contain lots of copies of F {\\displaystyle F} in order to compensate for it.","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"Common_graph"}
