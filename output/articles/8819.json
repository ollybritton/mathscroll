{"title":"Kostant's convexity theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Kostant's convexity theorem, introduced by Bertram Kostant (1973),  states that the projection of every coadjoint orbit of a connected compact Lie group into the dual of a Cartan subalgebra is a convex set. It is a special case of a more general result for symmetric spaces. Kostant's theorem is a generalization of a result of Schur (1923), Horn (1954) and Thompson (1972) for hermitian matrices. They proved that the projection onto the diagonal matrices of the space of all n by n complex self-adjoint matrices with given eigenvalues Λ = (λ1, ..., λn) is the convex polytope with vertices all permutations of the coordinates of Λ.","image":"a94eb54c7bdae2f76ad4d43f210dd71b5fa2beb4.svg","url":"Kostant's_convexity_theorem"}
