{"title":"co-NP","summary":"In computational complexity theory, co-NP is a complexity class. A decision problem X is a member of co-NP if and only if its complement X is in the complexity class NP. The class can be defined as follows: a decision problem is in co-NP precisely if only no-instances have a polynomial-length \"certificate\" and there is a polynomial-time algorithm that can be used to verify any purported certificate.","image":"b373ba338d56ac2a86879eea3cfbafdb7d2774db.svg","url":"Co-NP"}
