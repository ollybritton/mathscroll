{"title":"Curvature of a measure","summary":"In mathematics, the curvature of a measure defined on the Euclidean plane R2 is a quantification of how much the measure's \"distribution of mass\" is \"curved\". It is related to notions of curvature in geometry. In the form presented below, the concept was introduced in 1995 by the mathematician Mark S. Melnikov; accordingly, it may be referred to as the Melnikov curvature or Menger-Melnikov curvature. Melnikov and Verdera (1995) established a powerful connection between the curvature of measures and the Cauchy kernel.","image":"8c3b1abf37ea8e37329d7f400cb85a64c5dac53a.svg","url":"Curvature_of_a_measure"}
