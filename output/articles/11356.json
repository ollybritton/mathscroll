{"title":"Odd–even rationing","summary":"Odd–even rationing is a method of rationing in which access to some resource is restricted to some of the population on any given day. In a common example, drivers of private vehicles may be allowed to drive, park, or purchase gasoline on alternating days, according to whether the last digit in their license plate is even or odd. Similarly, during a drought, houses can be restricted from using water outdoors according to the parity of the house number.","image":"THE_STATE_OF_OREGON_WAS_THE_FIRST_TO_GO_TO_A_SYSTEM_OF_ODD_AND_EVEN_NUMBERS_DURING_THE_GASOLINE_CRISIS_IN_THE_FALL..._-_NARA_-_555489.jpg.webp","url":"Odd–even_rationing"}
