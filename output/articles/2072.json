{"title":"Busemann function","summary":"In geometric topology, Busemann functions are used to study the large-scale geometry of geodesics in Hadamard spaces and in particular Hadamard manifolds (simply connected complete Riemannian manifolds of nonpositive curvature). They are named after Herbert Busemann, who introduced them; he gave an extensive treatment of the topic in his 1955 book \"The geometry of geodesics\".","image":"cb4d7a16bca9e216c0221b43a1c3377aa5e358b8.svg","url":"Busemann_function"}
