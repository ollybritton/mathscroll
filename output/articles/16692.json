{"title":"Von Neumann universe","summary":"In set theory and related branches of mathematics, the von Neumann universe, or von Neumann hierarchy of sets, denoted by V, is the class of hereditary well-founded sets. This collection, which is formalized by Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), is often used to provide an interpretation or motivation of the axioms of ZFC. The concept is named after John von Neumann, although it was first published by Ernst Zermelo in 1930.","image":"e9784def4505227eaef08d506ef3197fdbdb1559.svg","url":"Von_Neumann_universe"}
