{"title":"Indeterminate form","summary":"In calculus and other branches of mathematical analysis, limits involving an algebraic combination of functions in an independent variable may often be evaluated by replacing these functions by their limits; if the expression obtained after this substitution does not provide sufficient information to determine the original limit, then the expression is called an indeterminate form. More specifically, an indeterminate form is a mathematical expression involving at most two of 0 {\\displaystyle 0~} , 1 {\\displaystyle 1} or âˆž {\\displaystyle \\infty } , obtained by applying the algebraic limit theorem in the process of attempting to determine a limit, which fails to restrict that limit to one specific value or infinity, and thus does not determine the limit being sought. A limit confirmed to be infinity is not indeterminate since it has been determined to have a specific value (infinity).[1] The term was originally introduced by Cauchy's student Moigno in the middle of the 19th century.","image":"ca74b379b6560f791d822341f60739d14bc7475f.svg","url":"Indeterminate_form"}
