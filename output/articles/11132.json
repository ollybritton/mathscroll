{"title":"Noether normalization lemma","summary":"In mathematics, the Noether normalization lemma is a result of commutative algebra, introduced by Emmy Noether in 1926.[1] It states that for any field k, and any finitely generated commutative k-algebra A, there exist algebraically independent elements y1, y2, ..., yd in A such that A is a finitely generated module over the polynomial ring S = kâ€Š[y1, y2, ..., yd]. The integer d is equal to the Krull dimension of the ring A; and if A is an integral domain, d is also the transcendence degree of the field of fractions of A over k.","image":"7e62b49b42409fec5b0b64abbaa295449645ed48.svg","url":"Noether_normalization_lemma"}
