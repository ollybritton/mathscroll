{"title":"Link (knot theory)","summary":"In mathematical knot theory, a link is a collection of knots which do not intersect, but which may be linked (or knotted) together. A knot can be described as a link with one component. Links and knots are studied in a branch of mathematics called knot theory. Implicit in this definition is that there is a trivial reference link, usually called the unlink, but the word is also sometimes used in context where there is no notion of a trivial link.","image":"Hopf_band_wikipedia.png.webp","url":"Link_(knot_theory)"}
