{"title":"Alex Chigogidze","summary":"Alexander Chigogidze (Georgian: ალექსანდრე ჩიგოგიძე; 1 January 1955 – 14 December 2014)[1] was a Georgian-born general topologist. Chigogidze is best known for his book Inverse Spectra,[2] in which he passed on to the next generation of topologists the results of the Fedorchuk -Schepin Topology seminars held at the Moscow State University during the 1980s. The book also contains important contributions Chigogidze made in the area of General Topology and Geometric Topology (of Bing-Borsuk type). In the area of General Topology, Chigogidze developed  extension theory for noncompact nonmetrizable spaces. In the area of Geometric Topology, Chigogidze introduced  grading to shape theory by developing a theory n-Shape where n is an arbitrary integer. This was a major addendum to the existing n-Homotopy theory.","image":"AlexChigogidze.jpg.webp","url":"Alex_Chigogidze"}
