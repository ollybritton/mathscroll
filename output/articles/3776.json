{"title":"Darboux vector","summary":"In differential geometry, especially the theory of space curves, the Darboux vector is the angular velocity vector of the Frenet frame of a space curve.[1]  It is named after Gaston Darboux who discovered it.[2]  It is also called angular momentum vector, because it is directly proportional to angular momentum.","image":"17273e7079042f680e9bfd83f224ae80e2cb7453.svg","url":"Darboux_vector"}
