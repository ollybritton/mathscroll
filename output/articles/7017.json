{"title":"Helix","summary":"A helix (/ˈhiːlɪks/) is a shape like a corkscrew or spiral staircase.  It is a type of smooth space curve with tangent lines at a constant angle to a fixed axis. Helices are important in biology, as the DNA molecule is formed as two intertwined helices, and many proteins have helical substructures, known as alpha helices. The word helix comes from the Greek word ἕλιξ, \"twisted, curved\".[1] A \"filled-in\" helix – for example, a \"spiral\" (helical) ramp – is a surface called helicoid.[2]","image":"Helix.svg.png.webp","url":"Helix"}
