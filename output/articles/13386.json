{"title":"Repdigit","summary":"In recreational mathematics, a repdigit or sometimes monodigit[1] is a natural number composed of repeated instances of the same digit in a positional number system (often implicitly decimal).  The word is a portmanteau of repeated and digit. Examples are 11, 666, 4444, and 999999. All repdigits are palindromic numbers and are multiples of repunits. Other well-known repdigits include the repunit primes and in particular the Mersenne primes (which are repdigits when represented in binary).","image":"47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a.svg","url":"Repdigit"}
