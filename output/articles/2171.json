{"title":"Cantellated 24-cell honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the cantellated 24-cell honeycomb is a uniform space-filling honeycomb. It can be seen as a cantellation of the regular 24-cell honeycomb, containing rectified tesseract, cantellated 24-cell, and tetrahedral prism cells.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Cantellated_24-cell_honeycomb"}
