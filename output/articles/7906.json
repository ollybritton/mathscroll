{"title":"Interior product","summary":"In mathematics, the interior product (also known as interior derivative, interior multiplication, inner multiplication, inner derivative, insertion operator, or inner derivation) is a degree −1 (anti)derivation on the exterior algebra of differential forms on a smooth manifold. The interior product, named in opposition to the exterior product, should not be confused with an inner product. The interior product ι X ω {\\displaystyle \\iota _{X}\\omega } is sometimes written as X ⌟ ω . {\\displaystyle X\\mathbin {\\lrcorner } \\omega .} [1]","image":"56184eeaf256ee60fa3d6dc813bd58f04c41573e.svg","url":"Interior_product"}
