{"title":"Gauss–Legendre method","summary":"In numerical analysis and scientific computing, the Gauss–Legendre methods are a family of numerical methods for ordinary differential equations. Gauss–Legendre methods are implicit Runge–Kutta methods. More specifically, they are collocation methods based on the points of Gauss–Legendre quadrature. The Gauss–Legendre method based on s points has order 2s.[1]","image":"bd6424be68450903e8876e27a1b05ed9fd54d7af.svg","url":"Gauss–Legendre_method"}
