{"title":"Binary Golay code","summary":"In mathematics and electronics engineering, a binary Golay code is a type of linear error-correcting code used in digital communications. The binary Golay code, along with the ternary Golay code, has a particularly deep and interesting connection to the theory of finite sporadic groups in mathematics.[1] These codes are named in honor of Marcel J. E. Golay whose 1949 paper[2] introducing them has been called, by E. R. Berlekamp, the \"best single published page\" in coding theory.[3]","image":"BinaryGolayCode.svg.png.webp","url":"Binary_Golay_code"}
