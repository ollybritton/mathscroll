{"title":"Order polynomial","summary":"The order polynomial is a polynomial studied in mathematics, in particular in algebraic graph theory and algebraic combinatorics. The order polynomial counts the number of order-preserving maps from a poset to a chain of length n {\\displaystyle n} . These order-preserving maps were first introduced by Richard P. Stanley while studying ordered structures and partitions as a Ph.D. student at Harvard University in 1971 under the guidance of Gian-Carlo Rota.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Order_polynomial"}
