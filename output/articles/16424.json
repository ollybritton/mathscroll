{"title":"Universal approximation theorem","summary":"In the mathematical theory of artificial neural networks, universal approximation theorems are results[1][2] that establish the density of an algorithmically generated class of functions within a given function space of interest.  Typically, these results concern the approximation capabilities of the feedforward architecture on the space of continuous functions between two Euclidean spaces, and the approximation is with respect to the compact convergence topology.","image":"cfc34e8f08e76555abf1181aae10f5cddd68fdd1.svg","url":"Universal_approximation_theorem"}
