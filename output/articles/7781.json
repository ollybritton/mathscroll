{"title":"Infinity-Borel set","summary":"In set theory, a subset of a Polish space X {\\displaystyle X} is ∞-Borel if it can be obtained by starting with the open subsets of X {\\displaystyle X} , and transfinitely iterating the operations of complementation and wellordered union. This concept is usually considered without the assumption of the axiom of choice, which means that the ∞-Borel sets may fail to be closed under wellordered union; see below.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Infinity-Borel_set"}
