{"title":"Shooting method","summary":"In numerical analysis, the shooting method is a method for solving a boundary value problem by reducing it to an initial value problem. It involves finding solutions to the initial value problem for different initial conditions until one finds the solution that also satisfies the boundary conditions of the boundary value problem. In layman's terms, one \"shoots\" out trajectories in different directions from one boundary until one finds the trajectory that \"hits\" the other boundary condition.","image":"b1e9349befd09d81fabd23b48ac89f9cc7ad04b8.svg","url":"Shooting_method"}
