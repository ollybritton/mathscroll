{"title":"Connection (algebraic framework)","summary":"Geometry of quantum systems (e.g., noncommutative geometry and supergeometry) is mainly phrased in algebraic terms of modules and algebras. Connections on modules are generalization of a linear connection on a smooth vector bundle E → X {\\displaystyle E\\to X} written as a Koszul connection on the C ∞ ( X ) {\\displaystyle C^{\\infty }(X)} -module of sections of E → X {\\displaystyle E\\to X} .[1]","image":"c6e385963fc9a729e22866cd3c05d5002c361bbf.svg","url":"Connection_(algebraic_framework)"}
