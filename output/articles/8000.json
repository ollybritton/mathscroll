{"title":"Inverse iteration","summary":"In numerical analysis, inverse iteration (also known as the inverse power method) is an iterative eigenvalue algorithm. It allows one to find an approximate eigenvector when an approximation to a corresponding eigenvalue is already known. The method is conceptually similar to  the power method. It appears to have originally been developed to compute resonance frequencies in the field of structural mechanics.
