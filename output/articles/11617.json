{"title":"Osculating circle","summary":"In differential geometry of curves, the osculating circle of a sufficiently smooth plane curve at a given point p on the curve has been traditionally defined as the circle passing through p and a pair of additional points on the curve infinitesimally close to p.  Its center lies on the inner normal line, and its curvature defines the curvature of the given curve at that point. This circle, which is the one among all tangent circles at the given point that approaches the curve most tightly, was named circulus osculans (Latin for \"kissing circle\") by Leibniz.","image":"Osculating_circle.svg.png.webp","url":"Osculating_circle"}
