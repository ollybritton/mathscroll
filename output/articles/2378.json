{"title":"Cauchy–Hadamard theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Cauchy–Hadamard theorem is a result in complex analysis named after the French mathematicians Augustin Louis Cauchy and Jacques Hadamard, describing the radius of convergence of a power series. It was published in 1821 by Cauchy,[1] but remained relatively unknown until Hadamard rediscovered it.[2] Hadamard's first publication of this result was in 1888;[3] he also included it as part of his 1892 Ph.D. thesis.[4]","image":"00f37a33a019860601224929ec8f3b5ccbd15473.svg","url":"Cauchy–Hadamard_theorem"}
