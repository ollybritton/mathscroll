{"title":"Star domain","summary":"In geometry, a set S {\\displaystyle S} in the Euclidean space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} is called a star domain (or star-convex set, star-shaped set  or radially convex set) if there exists an s 0 ∈ S {\\displaystyle s_{0}\\in S} such that for all s ∈ S , {\\displaystyle s\\in S,} the line segment from s 0 {\\displaystyle s_{0}} to s {\\displaystyle s} lies in S . {\\displaystyle S.} This definition is immediately generalizable to any real, or complex, vector space.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Star_domain"}
