{"title":"Ring of symmetric functions","summary":"In algebra and in particular in algebraic combinatorics, the ring of symmetric functions is a specific limit of the rings of symmetric polynomials in n indeterminates, as n goes to infinity. This ring serves as universal structure in which relations between symmetric polynomials can be expressed in a way independent of the number n of indeterminates (but its elements are neither polynomials nor functions). Among other things, this ring plays an important role in the representation theory of the symmetric group.","image":"5f9adfdac4d86d4245bfbead0c2d72311a5d333d.svg","url":"Ring_of_symmetric_functions"}
