{"title":"Specialization (pre)order","summary":"In the branch of mathematics known as topology, the specialization (or canonical) preorder is a natural preorder on the set of the points of a topological space. For most spaces that are considered in practice, namely for all those that satisfy the T0 separation axiom, this preorder is even a partial order (called the specialization order). On the other hand, for T1 spaces the order becomes trivial and is of little interest.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Specialization_(pre)order"}
