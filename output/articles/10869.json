{"title":"Möbius energy","summary":"In mathematics, the Möbius energy of a knot is a particular knot energy, i.e., a functional on the space of knots.  It was discovered by Jun O'Hara, who demonstrated that the energy blows up as the knot's strands get close to one another.[1]  This is a useful property because it prevents self-intersection and ensures the result under gradient descent is of the same knot type.","image":"9d47a8a9757af8ad6e3da8987a44c24806ed6773.svg","url":"Möbius_energy"}
