{"title":"Multiplicity-one theorem","summary":"In the mathematical theory of automorphic representations, a multiplicity-one theorem is a result about the representation theory of an adelic reductive algebraic group. The multiplicity in question is the number of times a given abstract group representation is realised in a certain space, of square-integrable functions, given in a concrete way.","image":"866f0b54a915210e9c87beca16b899ed3bc0b603.svg","url":"Multiplicity-one_theorem"}
