{"title":"Generator matrix","summary":"In coding theory, a generator matrix is a matrix whose rows form a basis for a linear code. The codewords are all of the linear combinations of the rows of this matrix, that is, the linear code is the row space of its generator matrix.","image":"f0d05009f825a0b37e15b6430507dde7ec8d07ce.svg","url":"Generator_matrix"}
