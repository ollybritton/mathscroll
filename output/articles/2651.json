{"title":"Circle of antisimilitude","summary":"In inversive geometry, the circle of antisimilitude (also known as mid-circle) of two circles, α and β, is a reference circle for which α and β are inverses of each other. If α and β are non-intersecting or tangent, a single circle of antisimilitude exists; if α and β intersect at two points, there are two circles of antisimilitude.  When α and β are congruent, the circle of antisimilitude degenerates to a line of symmetry through which α and β are reflections of each other.[1][2]","image":"Circle_of_antisimilitude0.svg.png.webp","url":"Circle_of_antisimilitude"}
