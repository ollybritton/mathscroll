{"title":"Saddlepoint approximation method","summary":"The saddlepoint approximation method, initially proposed by  Daniels (1954) is a specific example of the mathematical  saddlepoint  technique applied to statistics. It provides a highly accurate approximation formula for any PDF or probability mass function of a distribution, based on the  moment generating function. There is also a formula for the  CDF  of the distribution, proposed by Lugannani and Rice (1980).","image":"fec7adc70ea0e1d365e5f7244b6f7ddad9fbf485.svg","url":"Saddlepoint_approximation_method"}
