{"title":"Criss-cross algorithm","summary":"In mathematical optimization, the criss-cross algorithm is any of a family of algorithms for linear programming. Variants of the criss-cross algorithm also solve more general problems with linear inequality constraints and nonlinear objective functions; there are criss-cross algorithms for linear-fractional programming problems,[1][2] quadratic-programming problems, and linear complementarity problems.[3]","image":"Unitcube.svg.png.webp","url":"Criss-cross_algorithm"}
