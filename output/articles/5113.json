{"title":"Evil number","summary":"In number theory, an evil number is a non-negative integer that has an even number of 1s in its binary expansion.[1] These numbers give the positions of the zero values in the Thue–Morse sequence, and for this reason they have also been called the Thue–Morse set.[2] Non-negative integers that are not evil are called odious numbers.","image":"2aae8864a3c1fec9585261791a809ddec1489950.svg","url":"Evil_number"}
