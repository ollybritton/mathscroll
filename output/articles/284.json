{"title":"Absoluteness","summary":"In mathematical logic, a formula is said to be absolute to some class of structures (also called models), if it has the same truth value in each of the members of that class. One can also speak of absoluteness of a formula between two structures, if it is absolute to some class which contains both of them.. Theorems about absoluteness typically establish relationships between the absoluteness of formulas and their syntactic form.","image":"f364ec1265374b989d4297383db425d58216f4c6.svg","url":"Absoluteness"}
