{"title":"Intermediate value theorem","summary":"In mathematical analysis, the intermediate value theorem states that if f {\\displaystyle f} is a continuous function whose domain contains the interval [a, b], then it takes on any given value between f ( a ) {\\displaystyle f(a)} and f ( b ) {\\displaystyle f(b)} at some point within the interval.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Intermediate_value_theorem"}
