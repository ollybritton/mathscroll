{"title":"Translation plane","summary":"In mathematics, a translation plane is a projective plane which admits a certain group of symmetries (described below). Along with the Hughes planes and the Figueroa planes, translation planes are among the most well-studied of the known non-Desarguesian planes, and the vast majority of known non-Desarguesian planes are either translation planes, or can be obtained from a translation plane via successive iterations of dualization and/or derivation.[1]","image":"ba2c023bad1bd39ed49080f729cbf26bc448c9ba.svg","url":"Translation_plane"}
