{"title":"Tarski's high school algebra problem","summary":"In mathematical logic, Tarski's high school algebra problem was a question posed by Alfred Tarski.  It asks whether there are identities involving addition, multiplication, and exponentiation over the positive integers that cannot be proved using eleven axioms about these operations that are taught in high-school-level mathematics.  The question was solved in 1980 by Alex Wilkie, who showed that such unprovable identities do exist.","image":"0b91c30f731b67e012dd61c74221ebe380d01144.svg","url":"Tarski's_high_school_algebra_problem"}
