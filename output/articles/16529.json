{"title":"Vector-valued differential form","summary":"In mathematics, a vector-valued differential form on a manifold M is a differential form on M with values in a vector space V. More generally, it is a differential form with values in some vector bundle E over M. Ordinary differential forms can be viewed as R-valued differential forms.","image":"54e33f325318e45216e2dc12cbdfeca989745a76.svg","url":"Vector-valued_differential_form"}
