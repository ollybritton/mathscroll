{"title":"Rotational cryptanalysis","summary":"In cryptography, rotational cryptanalysis is a generic cryptanalytic attack against algorithms that rely on three operations: modular addition, rotation and XOR â€” ARX for short. Algorithms relying on these operations are popular because they are relatively cheap in both hardware and software and run in constant time, making them safe from timing attacks in common implementations.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Rotational_cryptanalysis"}
