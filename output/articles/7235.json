{"title":"Hilbert's tenth problem","summary":"Hilbert's tenth problem is the tenth on the list of mathematical problems that the German mathematician David Hilbert posed in 1900.  It is the challenge to provide a general algorithm which, for any given Diophantine equation (a polynomial equation with integer coefficients and a finite number of unknowns), can decide whether the equation has a solution with all unknowns taking integer values.","image":"8910f4effecd233e05aa6875f998d60adaebd9f7.svg","url":"Hilbert's_tenth_problem"}
