{"title":"Factorization system","summary":"In mathematics, it can be shown that every function can be written as the composite of a surjective function followed by an injective function. Factorization systems are a generalization of this situation in category theory.","image":"1069ec53aeafae8780e797ebe27e424ae85df532.svg","url":"Factorization_system"}
