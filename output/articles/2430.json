{"title":"Central polynomial","summary":"In algebra, a central polynomial for n-by-n matrices is a polynomial in non-commuting variables that is non-constant but yields a scalar matrix whenever it is evaluated at n-by-n matrices. That such polynomials exist for any square matrices was discovered in 1970 independently by Formanek and Razmyslov. The term \"central\" is because the evaluation of a central polynomial has the image lying in the center of the matrix ring over any commutative ring. The notion has an application to the theory of polynomial identity rings.","image":"de9496558796dbeb3482c4e77023c60764a9e42c.svg","url":"Central_polynomial"}
