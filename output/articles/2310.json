{"title":"Casson handle","summary":"In 4-dimensional topology, a branch of mathematics, a Casson handle is a 4-dimensional topological 2-handle constructed by an infinite procedure. They are named for Andrew Casson, who introduced them in about 1973. They were originally called \"flexible handles\" by Casson himself, and Michael FreedmanÂ (1982) introduced the name \"Casson handle\" by which they are known today. In that work he showed that Casson handles are topological 2-handles, and used this to classify simply connected compact topological 4-manifolds.","image":"88528fefcfac1b22d2df9b71d0f4fc9e758f65ad.svg","url":"Casson_handle"}
