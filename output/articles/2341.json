{"title":"Category of representations","summary":"In representation theory, the category of representations of some algebraic structure A has the representations of A as objects and equivariant maps as morphisms between them. One of the basic thrusts of representation theory is to understand the conditions under which this category is semisimple; i.e., whether an object decomposes into simple objects (see Maschke's theorem for the case of finite groups).","image":"14aef9a24a6ba12ee9d6226b6b1d3d0cb5e47e79.svg","url":"Category_of_representations"}
