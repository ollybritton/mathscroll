{"title":"Sunzi Suanjing","summary":"Sunzi Suanjing (Chinese: 孫子算經; pinyin: Sūnzǐ Suànjīng; Wade–Giles: Sun Tzu Suan Ching; lit. 'The Mathematical Classic of Master Sun/Master Sun's Mathematical Manual') was a mathematical treatise written during 3rd to 5th centuries AD which was listed as one of the Ten Computational Canons during the Tang dynasty. The specific identity of its author Sunzi (lit. \"Master Sun\") is still unknown but he lived much later than his namesake Sun Tzu, author of The Art of War. From the textual evidence in the book, some scholars concluded that the work was completed during the Southern and Northern Dynasties.[2] Besides describing arithmetic methods and investigating Diophantine equations, the treatise touches upon astronomy and attempts to develop a calendar.","image":"Sun_Zi_Suanjing.JPG.webp","url":"Sunzi_Suanjing"}
