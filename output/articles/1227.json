{"title":"B6 polytope","summary":"In 6-dimensional geometry, there are 64 uniform polytopes with B6 symmetry. There are two regular forms, the 6-orthoplex, and 6-cube with 12 and 64 vertices respectively. The 6-demicube is added with half the symmetry.","image":"6-cube_t0.svg.png.webp","url":"B6_polytope"}
