{"title":"Étale topology","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the étale topology is a Grothendieck topology on the category of schemes which has properties similar to the Euclidean topology, but unlike the Euclidean topology, it is also defined in positive characteristic.  The étale topology was originally introduced by Grothendieck to define étale cohomology, and this is still the étale topology's most well-known use.","image":"0617c163a03d1584ad15e192f2d488ffaaef7d0c.svg","url":"Étale_topology"}
