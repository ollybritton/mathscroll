{"title":"Bipolar theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the bipolar theorem is a theorem in functional analysis that characterizes the bipolar (that is, the polar of the polar) of a set. In convex analysis, the bipolar theorem refers to a necessary and sufficient conditions for a cone to be equal to its bipolar.  The bipolar theorem can be seen as a special case of the Fenchel–Moreau theorem.[1]: 76–77","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Bipolar_theorem"}
