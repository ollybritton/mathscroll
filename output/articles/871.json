{"title":"Antiparallelogram","summary":"In geometry, an antiparallelogram is a type of self-crossing quadrilateral. Like a parallelogram, an antiparallelogram has two opposite pairs of equal-length sides, but these pairs of sides are not in general parallel. Instead, sides in the longer pair cross each other as in a scissors mechanism. Antiparallelograms are also called contraparallelograms[1] or crossed parallelograms.[2]","image":"Antiparallelogram.svg.png.webp","url":"Antiparallelogram"}
