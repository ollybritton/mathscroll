{"title":"Quantum Fourier transform","summary":"In quantum computing, the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a linear transformation on quantum bits, and is the quantum analogue of the discrete Fourier transform. The quantum Fourier transform is a part of many quantum algorithms, notably Shor's algorithm for factoring and computing the discrete logarithm, the quantum phase estimation algorithm for estimating the eigenvalues of a unitary operator, and algorithms for the hidden subgroup problem.  The quantum Fourier transform was discovered by Don Coppersmith.[1]","image":"8226f30650ee4fe4e640c6d2798127e80e9c160d.svg","url":"Quantum_Fourier_transform"}
