{"title":"Fitting subgroup","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the area of algebra known as group theory, the Fitting subgroup F of a finite group G, named after Hans Fitting, is the unique largest normal nilpotent subgroup of G.  Intuitively, it represents the smallest subgroup which \"controls\" the structure of G when G is solvable. When G is not solvable, a similar role is played by the generalized Fitting subgroup F*, which is generated by the Fitting subgroup and the components of G.","image":"43ccffedf4b695d3950030be0593fb6406c56c5c.svg","url":"Fitting_subgroup"}
