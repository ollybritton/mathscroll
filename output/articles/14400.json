{"title":"Simple polygon","summary":"In geometry, a simple polygon /ˈpɒlɪɡɒn/ is a polygon that does not intersect itself and has no holes. That is, it is a flat shape consisting of straight, non-intersecting line segments or \"sides\" that are joined pairwise to form a single closed path. If the sides intersect then the polygon is not simple. The qualifier \"simple\" is frequently omitted, with the above definition then being understood to define a polygon in general.","image":"Polygons_Examples_of_polygons.png.webp","url":"Simple_polygon"}
