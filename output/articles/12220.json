{"title":"Plural quantification","summary":"In mathematics and logic, plural quantification is the theory that an individual variable x may take on plural, as well as singular, values. As well as substituting individual objects such as Alice, the number 1, the tallest building in London etc. for x, we may substitute both Alice and Bob, or all the numbers between 0 and 10, or all the buildings in London over 20 stories.","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"Plural_quantification"}
