{"title":"Satake isomorphism","summary":"In mathematics, the Satake isomorphism, introduced by Ichirō Satake (1963), identifies the Hecke algebra of a reductive group over a local field with a ring of invariants of the Weyl group.  The geometric Satake equivalence is a geometric version of the Satake isomorphism, proved by Ivan Mirković and Kari Vilonen (2007).","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Satake_isomorphism"}
