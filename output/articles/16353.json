{"title":"Uniform boundedness principle","summary":"In mathematics, the uniform boundedness principle or Banach–Steinhaus theorem is one of the fundamental results in functional analysis. Together with the Hahn–Banach theorem and the open mapping theorem, it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field. In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of continuous linear operators (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a Banach space, pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Uniform_boundedness_principle"}
