{"title":"Skew binary number system","summary":"The skew binary number system is a non-standard positional numeral system in which the nth digit contributes a value of 2 n + 1 âˆ’ 1 {\\displaystyle 2^{n+1}-1} times the digit (digits are indexed from 0) instead of 2 n {\\displaystyle 2^{n}} times as they do in binary.  Each digit has a value of 0, 1, or 2. A number can have many skew binary representations. For example, a decimal number 15 can be written as 1000, 201 and 122. Each number can be written uniquely in skew binary canonical form where there is only at most one instance of the digit 2, which must be the least significant nonzero digit. In this case 15 is written canonically as 1000.","image":"62451b1baffd4fa153d1a7465d21ea608205076d.svg","url":"Skew_binary_number_system"}
