{"title":"Seminorm","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in functional analysis, a seminorm is a vector space norm that need not be positive definite.  Seminorms are intimately connected with convex sets: every seminorm is the Minkowski functional of some absorbing disk and, conversely, the Minkowski functional of any such set is a seminorm.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Seminorm"}
