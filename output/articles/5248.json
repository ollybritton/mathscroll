{"title":"FP (complexity)","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the complexity class FP is the set of function problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. It is the function problem version of the decision problem class P. Roughly speaking, it is the class of functions that can be efficiently computed on classical computers without randomization.","image":"d5b3d8f37f5458c22b61eaf26e5af0523acb63e2.svg","url":"FP_(complexity)"}
