{"title":"Elliptic coordinate system","summary":"In geometry, the elliptic coordinate system is a two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system in which the coordinate lines are confocal ellipses and hyperbolae.  The two foci F 1 {\\displaystyle F_{1}} and F 2 {\\displaystyle F_{2}} are generally taken to be fixed at âˆ’ a {\\displaystyle -a} and + a {\\displaystyle +a} , respectively, on the x {\\displaystyle x} -axis of the Cartesian coordinate system.","image":"100c7fbf174fe8b06eacc2a6b0bb2e1badd1c7ce.svg","url":"Elliptic_coordinate_system"}
