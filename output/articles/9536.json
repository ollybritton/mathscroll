{"title":"List of probabilistic proofs of non-probabilistic theorems","summary":"Probability theory routinely uses results from other fields of mathematics (mostly, analysis). The opposite cases, collected below, are relatively rare; however, probability theory is used systematically in combinatorics via the probabilistic method. They are particularly used for non-constructive proofs.","image":"0502012bc3b4e73e6f3c2f4748feaab3fd3c350d.svg","url":"List_of_probabilistic_proofs_of_non-probabilistic_theorems"}
