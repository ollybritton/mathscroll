{"title":"Internal category","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in category theory, internal categories are a generalisation of the notion of small category, and are defined with respect to a fixed ambient category. If the ambient category is taken to be the category of sets then one recovers the theory of small categories. In general, internal categories consist of a pair of objects in the ambient category—thought of as the 'object of objects' and 'object of morphisms'—together with a collection of morphisms in the ambient category satisfying certain identities. Group objects, are common examples of internal categories.","image":"4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029.svg","url":"Internal_category"}
