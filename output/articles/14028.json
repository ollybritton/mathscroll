{"title":"Scott continuity","summary":"In mathematics, given two partially ordered sets P and Q, a function f: P → Q between them is Scott-continuous (named after the mathematician Dana Scott) if it preserves all directed suprema. That is, for every directed subset D of P with supremum in P, its image has a supremum in Q, and that supremum is the image of the supremum of D, i.e. ⊔ f [ D ] = f ( ⊔ D ) {\\displaystyle \\sqcup f[D]=f(\\sqcup D)} , where ⊔ {\\displaystyle \\sqcup } is the directed join.[1] When Q {\\displaystyle Q} is the poset of truth values, i.e. Sierpiński space, then Scott-continuous functions are characteristic functions of open sets, and thus Sierpiński space is the classifying space for open sets.[2]","image":"7c715897d8687fbb6c42ee7c69cce594ebed8447.svg","url":"Scott_continuity"}
