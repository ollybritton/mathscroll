{"title":"Eilenberg–Moore spectral sequence","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of algebraic topology, the Eilenberg–Moore spectral sequence addresses the calculation of the homology groups of a pullback over a fibration. The spectral sequence formulates the calculation from knowledge of the homology of the remaining spaces. Samuel Eilenberg and John C. Moore's original paper addresses this for singular homology.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Eilenberg–Moore_spectral_sequence"}
