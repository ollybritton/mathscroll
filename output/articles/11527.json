{"title":"Order embedding","summary":"In order theory, a branch of mathematics, an order embedding is a special kind of monotone function, which provides a way to include one partially ordered set into another. Like Galois connections, order embeddings constitute a notion which is strictly weaker than the concept of an order isomorphism. Both of these weakenings may be understood in terms of category theory.","image":"d7e8fafe062081eef7510325dda0ea36c83a5a38.svg","url":"Order_embedding"}
