{"title":"Folded spectrum method","summary":"In mathematics, the folded spectrum method (FSM) is an iterative method for solving large eigenvalue problems. Here you always find a vector with an eigenvalue close to a search-value ε {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon } .  This means you can get a vector Ψ {\\displaystyle \\Psi } in the middle of the spectrum without solving the matrix.","image":"a30c89172e5b88edbd45d3e2772c7f5e562e5173.svg","url":"Folded_spectrum_method"}
