{"title":"Snub triheptagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the order-3 snub heptagonal tiling is a semiregular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. There are four triangles and one heptagon on each vertex. It has Schläfli symbol of sr{7,3}.  The snub tetraheptagonal tiling is another related hyperbolic tiling with Schläfli symbol sr{7,4}.","image":"Snub_triheptagonal_tiling.svg.png.webp","url":"Snub_triheptagonal_tiling"}
