{"title":"Circumcenter of mass","summary":"In geometry, the circumcenter of mass is a center associated with a polygon which shares many of the properties of the center of mass. More generally, the circumcenter of mass may be defined for simplicial polytopes and also in the spherical and hyperbolic geometries.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Circumcenter_of_mass"}
