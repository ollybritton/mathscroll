{"title":"Moving sofa problem","summary":"In mathematics, the moving sofa problem or sofa problem is a two-dimensional idealisation of real-life furniture-moving problems and asks for the rigid two-dimensional shape of largest area that can be maneuvered through an L-shaped planar region with legs of unit width.[1] The area thus obtained is referred to as the sofa constant. The exact value of the sofa constant is an open problem. The currently leading solution, by Joseph L. Gerver, has a value of approximately 2.2195 and is thought to be close to the optimal, based upon subsequent study and theoretical bounds.","image":"Hammersley_sofa_animated.gif","url":"Moving_sofa_problem"}
