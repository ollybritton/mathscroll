{"title":"Bilinear interpolation","summary":"In mathematics, bilinear interpolation is a method for interpolating functions of two variables (e.g., x and y) using repeated linear interpolation. It is usually applied to functions sampled on a 2D rectilinear grid, though it can be generalized to functions defined on the vertices of (a mesh of) arbitrary convex quadrilaterals.","image":"Bilininterp.png.webp","url":"Bilinear_interpolation"}
