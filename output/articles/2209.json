{"title":"Capacity of a set","summary":"In mathematics, the capacity of a set in Euclidean space is a measure of the \"size\" of that set.  Unlike, say, Lebesgue measure, which measures a set's volume or physical extent, capacity is a mathematical analogue of a set's ability to hold electrical charge.  More precisely, it is the capacitance of the set: the total charge a set can hold while maintaining a given potential energy.  The potential energy is computed with respect to an idealized ground at infinity for the harmonic or Newtonian capacity, and with respect to a surface for the condenser capacity.","image":"faf2e27b6f47eb3b5706d37313488b3ba93e458b.svg","url":"Capacity_of_a_set"}
