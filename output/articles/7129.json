{"title":"Hesse normal form","summary":"The Hesse normal form named after Otto Hesse, is an equation used in analytic geometry, and describes a line in R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} or a plane in Euclidean space R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} or a hyperplane in higher dimensions.[1][2] It is primarily used for calculating distances (see point-plane distance and point-line distance).","image":"e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd.svg","url":"Hesse_normal_form"}
