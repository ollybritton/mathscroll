{"title":"Flat (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a flat or Euclidean subspace is a subset of a Euclidean space that is itself a Euclidean space (of lower dimension).  The flats in two-dimensional space are points and lines, and the flats in three-dimensional space are points, lines, and planes.","image":"484c0373ddd17a70af71a13abfa6f4e80aad60bc.svg","url":"Flat_(geometry)"}
