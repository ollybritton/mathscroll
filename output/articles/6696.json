{"title":"Gyroelongated pentagonal rotunda","summary":"In geometry, the gyroelongated pentagonal rotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J25). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a pentagonal rotunda (J6) by attaching a decagonal antiprism to its base. It can also be seen as a gyroelongated pentagonal birotunda (J48) with one pentagonal rotunda removed.","image":"Gyroelongated_pentagonal_rotunda.png.webp","url":"Gyroelongated_pentagonal_rotunda"}
