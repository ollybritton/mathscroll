{"title":"Étale spectrum","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics, the étale spectrum of a commutative ring or an E∞-ring, denoted by Specét or Spét, is an analog of the prime spectrum Spec of a commutative ring that is obtained by replacing Zariski topology with étale topology. The precise definition depends on one's formalism. But the idea of the definition itself is simple. The usual prime spectrum Spec enjoys the relation: for a scheme (S, OS) and a commutative ring A,","image":"dd4750a0dd1d189d1c632f1dccc0f7034009b309.svg","url":"Étale_spectrum"}
