{"title":"γ-space","summary":"In mathematics, a γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } -space is a topological space that satisfies a certain a basic selection principle. An infinite cover of a topological space is an ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } -cover if every finite subset of this space is contained in some member of the cover, and the whole space is not a member the cover. A cover of a topological space is a γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } -cover if every point of this space belongs to all but finitely many members of this cover. A γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } -space is a space in which every open ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } -cover contains a γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } -cover.","image":"a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a.svg","url":"Γ-space"}
