{"title":"Carmichael's theorem","summary":"In number theory, Carmichael's theorem, named after the American mathematician R. D. Carmichael, states that, for any nondegenerate Lucas sequence of the first kind Un(P, Q) with relatively prime parameters P, Q and positive discriminant, an element Un with n ≠ 1, 2, 6 has at least one prime divisor that does not divide any earlier one except the 12th Fibonacci number F(12) = U12(1, −1) = 144 and its equivalent U12(−1, −1) = −144.","image":"a8edcf49e5e862b68bd362e7ea0763b88da913c7.svg","url":"Carmichael's_theorem"}
