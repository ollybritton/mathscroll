{"title":"Rose (topology)","summary":"In mathematics, a rose (also known as a bouquet of n circles) is a topological space obtained by gluing together a collection of circles along a single point.  The circles of the rose are called petals.  Roses are important in algebraic topology, where they are closely related to free groups.","image":"Topological_Rose.png.webp","url":"Rose_(topology)"}
