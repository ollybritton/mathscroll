{"title":"Fundamental theorem of algebra","summary":"The fundamental theorem of algebra, also known as d'Alembert's theorem,[1] or the d'Alembertâ€“Gauss theorem,[2] states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. This includes polynomials with real coefficients, since every real number is a complex number with its imaginary part equal to zero.","image":"31e6f2638fc5148b4fe1e1abe07d097698ee1992.svg","url":"Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra"}
