{"title":"Simplex tree","summary":"In topological data analysis, a simplex tree is a type of trie used to represent efficiently any general simplicial complex. Through its nodes, this data structure notably explicitly represents all the simplices. Its flexible structure allows implementation of many basic operations useful to computing persistent homology. This data structure was invented by Jean-Daniel Boissonnat and Cl√©ment Maria in 2014, in the article The Simplex Tree: An Efficient Data Structure for General Simplicial Complexes.[1] This data structure offers efficient operations on sparse simplicial complexes. For dense or maximal simplices, Skeleton-Blocker[2] representations or Toplex Map[3] representations are used.","image":"SimplexTree.png.webp","url":"Simplex_tree"}
