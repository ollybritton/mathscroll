{"title":"Dicyclic group","summary":"In group theory, a dicyclic group (notation Dicn or Q4n,[1] ⟨n,2,2⟩[2]) is a particular kind of non-abelian group of order 4n (n > 1).  It is an extension of the cyclic group of order 2 by a cyclic group of order 2n, giving the name di-cyclic. In the notation of exact sequences of groups, this extension can be expressed as:","image":"479043b4461e661e05ed7f90c4868f8e9a9340bd.svg","url":"Dicyclic_group"}
