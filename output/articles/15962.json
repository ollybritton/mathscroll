{"title":"Transfinite interpolation","summary":"In numerical analysis, transfinite interpolation is a means to construct functions over a planar domain in such a way that they match a given function on the boundary. This method is applied in geometric modelling and in the field of finite element method.[1]","image":"26fc45e0d908a0172a1641eeb1c2d580c8d2415a.svg","url":"Transfinite_interpolation"}
