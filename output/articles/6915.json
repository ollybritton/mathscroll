{"title":"Harnack's inequality","summary":"In mathematics, Harnack's inequality is an inequality relating the values of a positive harmonic function at two points, introduced by A. Harnack (1887). Harnack's inequality is used to prove Harnack's theorem about the convergence of sequences of harmonic functions. J. Serrin (1955), and J. Moser (1961, 1964) generalized Harnack's inequality to solutions of elliptic or parabolic partial differential equations. Such results can be used to show the interior regularity of weak solutions.","image":"Graph_of_Harnack's_inequality.png.webp","url":"Harnack's_inequality"}
