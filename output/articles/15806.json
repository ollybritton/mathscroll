{"title":"Timeline of mathematics","summary":"This is a timeline of pure and applied mathematics history. It is divided here into three stages, corresponding to stages in the development of mathematical notation: a \"rhetorical\" stage in which calculations are described purely by words, a \"syncopated\" stage in which quantities and common algebraic operations are beginning to be represented by symbolic abbreviations, and finally a  \"symbolic\" stage, in which comprehensive notational systems for formulas are the norm.","image":"b707cd59ee05e726146a8362bae07ef3ea5c33de.svg","url":"Timeline_of_mathematics"}
