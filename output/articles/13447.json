{"title":"Reverse-delete algorithm","summary":"The reverse-delete algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory used to obtain a minimum spanning tree from a given connected, edge-weighted graph.  It first appeared in Kruskal (1956), but it should not be confused with Kruskal's algorithm which appears in the same paper. If the graph is disconnected, this algorithm will find a minimum spanning tree for each disconnected part of the graph.  The set of these minimum spanning trees is called a minimum spanning forest, which contains every vertex in the graph.","image":"Reverse_Delete_0.svg.png.webp","url":"Reverse-delete_algorithm"}
