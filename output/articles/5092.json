{"title":"Euler–Lagrange equation","summary":"In the calculus of variations and classical mechanics, the Euler–Lagrange equations[1] are a system of second-order ordinary differential equations whose solutions are stationary points of the given action functional. The equations were discovered in the 1750s by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler and Italian mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange.","image":"df910ba6f37b563ee4a821d8916a560d474aa7a5.svg","url":"Euler–Lagrange_equation"}
