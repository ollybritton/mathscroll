{"title":"Field of fractions","summary":"In abstract algebra, the field of fractions of an integral domain is the smallest field in which it can be embedded. The construction of the field of fractions is modeled on the relationship between the integral domain of integers and the field of rational numbers. Intuitively, it consists of ratios between integral domain elements.","image":"Latex_integers.svg.png.webp","url":"Field_of_fractions"}
