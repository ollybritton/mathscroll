{"title":"Witt vector","summary":"In mathematics, a Witt vector is an infinite sequence of elements of a commutative ring. Ernst Witt showed how to put a ring structure on the set of Witt vectors, in such a way that the ring of Witt vectors W ( F p ) {\\displaystyle W(\\mathbb {F} _{p})} over the finite field of order p {\\displaystyle p} is the ring of p {\\displaystyle p} -adic integers. They have a highly non-intuitive structure[1] upon first glance because their additive and multiplicative structure depends on an infinite set of recursive formulas which do not behave like addition and multiplication formulas for standard p-adic integers. The main idea[1] behind Witt vectors is instead of using the standard p {\\displaystyle p} -adic expansion","image":"7d3a33bb41365259950db689ee1885eb8ebf8727.svg","url":"Witt_vector"}
