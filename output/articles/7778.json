{"title":"Infinitesimal generator (stochastic processes)","summary":"In mathematics — specifically, in stochastic analysis — the infinitesimal generator of a Feller process (i.e. a continuous-time Markov process satisfying certain regularity conditions) is a Fourier multiplier operator[1] that encodes a great deal of information about the process. The generator is used in evolution equations such as the Kolmogorov backward equation (which describes the evolution of statistics of the process); its L2 Hermitian adjoint is used in evolution equations such as the Fokker–Planck equation (which describes the evolution of the probability density functions of the process).","image":"21296940fbeeae13b27893bdb77c0ae6a02ad23f.svg","url":"Infinitesimal_generator_(stochastic_processes)"}
