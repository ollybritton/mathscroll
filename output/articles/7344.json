{"title":"Holonomic function","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in analysis, a holonomic function is a smooth function of several variables that is a solution of a system of linear homogeneous differential equations with polynomial coefficients and satisfies a suitable dimension condition in terms of D-modules theory.  More precisely, a holonomic function is an element of a holonomic module of smooth functions.  Holonomic functions can also be described as differentiably finite functions, also known as D-finite functions.  When a power series in the variables is the Taylor expansion of a holonomic function, the sequence of its coefficients, in one or several indices, is also called holonomic.  Holonomic sequences are also called P-recursive sequences: they are defined recursively by multivariate recurrences satisfied by the whole sequence and by suitable specializations of it.  The situation simplifies in the univariate case: any univariate sequence that satisfies a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients, or equivalently a linear homogeneous difference equation with polynomial coefficients, is holonomic.[1]","image":"1848c435e64864e9ad4efa7e46bd6bc900c35c99.svg","url":"Holonomic_function"}
