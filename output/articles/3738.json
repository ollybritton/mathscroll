{"title":"DF-space","summary":"In the field of functional analysis, DF-spaces, also written (DF)-spaces are locally convex topological vector space having a property that is shared by locally convex metrizable topological vector spaces. They play a considerable part in the theory of topological tensor products.[1]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"DF-space"}
