{"title":"Regular semigroup","summary":"In mathematics, a regular semigroup is a semigroup S in which every element is regular, i.e., for each element a in S there exists an element x in S such that axa = a.[1]  Regular semigroups are one of the most-studied classes of semigroups, and their structure is particularly amenable to study via Green's relations.[2]","image":"b3a45920ded242f4ab48aa18adfd4d9d8616b6cb.svg","url":"Regular_semigroup"}
