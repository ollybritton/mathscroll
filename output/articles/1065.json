{"title":"Askey scheme","summary":"In mathematics, the Askey scheme is a way of organizing orthogonal polynomials of hypergeometric or basic hypergeometric type into a hierarchy. For the classical orthogonal polynomials discussed in Andrews & Askey (1985), the Askey scheme  was first drawn by Labelle (1985) and by Askey and WilsonÂ (1985), and has since been extended by Koekoek & Swarttouw (1998) and Koekoek, Lesky & Swarttouw (2010) to cover basic orthogonal polynomials.","image":"4309b95f743c6afa57a92becd422f3983e160695.svg","url":"Askey_scheme"}
