{"title":"Complexity index","summary":"In modern computer science and statistics, the complexity index of a function denotes the level of informational content, which in turn affects the difficulty of learning the function from examples. This is different from computational complexity, which is the difficulty to compute a function. Complexity indices characterize the entire class of functions to which the one we are interested in belongs. Focusing on Boolean functions, the detail of a class C {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {C}}} of Boolean functions c essentially denotes how deeply the class is articulated.","image":"699cb4847ecedddeeae2b69e2892ba9987f9b1d1.svg","url":"Complexity_index"}
