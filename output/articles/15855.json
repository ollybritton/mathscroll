{"title":"Topological indistinguishability","summary":"In topology, two points of a topological space X are topologically indistinguishable if they have exactly the same neighborhoods. That is, if x and y are points in X, and Nx is the set of all neighborhoods that contain x, and Ny is the set of all neighborhoods that contain y, then x and y are \"topologically indistinguishable\" if and only if Nx = Ny. (See Hausdorff's axiomatic neighborhood systems.)","image":"130228140325315639658759a1190e0071ef1fd1.svg","url":"Topological_indistinguishability"}
