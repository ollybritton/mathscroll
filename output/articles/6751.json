{"title":"HP-55","summary":"The HP-55 was a programmable handheld calculator; a lower-cost alternative to the HP-65. Introduced by Hewlett-Packard in 1975, it featured twenty storage registers and room for 49 keystroke instructions. Its outward appearance was similar to the HP-65, but its silver band went through between the display and the keyboard like HP-45, its some key functions were different from HP-65 and it did not have a magnetic card reader/writer. Like all Hewlett-Packard calculators of the era and most since, the HP-55 used Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and a four-level automatic operand stack.","image":"HP_55_Calculator.jpg.webp","url":"HP-55"}
