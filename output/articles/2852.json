{"title":"Cohomology","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in homology theory and algebraic topology, cohomology is a general term for a sequence of abelian groups, usually one associated with a topological space, often defined from a cochain complex. Cohomology can be viewed as a method of assigning richer algebraic invariants to a space than homology. Some versions of cohomology arise by dualizing the construction of homology. In other words, cochains are functions on the group of chains in homology theory.","image":"629aa3485d2063854dab078f7a66c0268f6e4c0b.svg","url":"Cohomology"}
