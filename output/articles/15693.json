{"title":"Theory (mathematical logic)","summary":"In mathematical logic, a theory (also called a formal theory) is a set of sentences in a formal language. In most scenarios a deductive system is first understood from context, after which an element ϕ ∈ T {\\displaystyle \\phi \\in T} of a deductively closed theory T {\\displaystyle T} is then called a theorem of the theory. In many deductive systems there is usually a subset Σ ⊆ T {\\displaystyle \\Sigma \\subseteq T} that is called \"the set of axioms\" of the theory T {\\displaystyle T} , in which case the deductive system is also called an \"axiomatic system\". By definition, every axiom is automatically a theorem. A first-order theory is a set of first-order sentences (theorems) recursively obtained by the inference rules of the system applied to the set of axioms.","image":"ac5da949f15e0f8b86c72325d45e8c0f4ebe4f01.svg","url":"Theory_(mathematical_logic)"}
