{"title":"Bernstein–Sato polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, the Bernstein–Sato polynomial is a polynomial related to differential operators,  introduced independently by Joseph Bernstein (1971) and Mikio Sato and Takuro Shintani (1972, 1974), Sato (1990). It is also known as the b-function,  the b-polynomial, and the Bernstein polynomial, though it is not related to the Bernstein polynomials used in approximation theory. It has applications to singularity theory, monodromy theory, and quantum field theory.","image":"202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074.svg","url":"Bernstein–Sato_polynomial"}
