{"title":"Jenkins–Traub algorithm","summary":"The Jenkins–Traub algorithm for polynomial zeros is a fast globally convergent iterative polynomial root-finding method published in 1970 by Michael A. Jenkins and Joseph F. Traub. They gave two variants, one for general polynomials with complex coefficients, commonly known as the \"CPOLY\" algorithm, and a more complicated variant for the special case of polynomials with real coefficients, commonly known as the \"RPOLY\" algorithm. The latter is \"practically a standard in black-box polynomial root-finders\".[1]","image":"b0fd0eaec13e079aee3002d27b380ab35a02e2ef.svg","url":"Jenkins–Traub_algorithm"}
