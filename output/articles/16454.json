{"title":"Up-and-Down Designs","summary":"Up-and-down designs (UDDs) are a family of statistical experiment designs used in dose-finding experiments in science, engineering, and medical research. Dose-finding experiments have binary responses: each individual outcome can be described as one of two possible values, such as success vs. failure or toxic vs. non-toxic. Mathematically the binary responses are coded as 1 and 0. The goal of dose-finding experiments is to estimate the strength of treatment (i.e., the \"dose\") that would trigger the \"1\" response a pre-specified proportion of the time. This dose can be envisioned as a percentile of the distribution of response thresholds. An example where dose-finding is used is in an experiment to estimate the LD50 of some toxic chemical with respect to mice.","image":"UpAndDownFig1.jpg.webp","url":"Up-and-Down_Designs"}
