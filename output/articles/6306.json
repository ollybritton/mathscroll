{"title":"Glivenko's theorem (probability theory)","summary":"In probability theory, Glivenko's theorem states that if φ n , n ∈ N {\\displaystyle \\varphi _{n},n\\in \\mathbb {N} } , φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } are the characteristic functions of some probability distributions μ n , μ {\\displaystyle \\mu _{n},\\mu } respectively and φ n → φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi _{n}\\to \\varphi } almost everywhere, then μ n → μ {\\displaystyle \\mu _{n}\\to \\mu } in the sense of probability distributions.[1]","image":"6d0993c20939a055494225ba748e60a47523e075.svg","url":"Glivenko's_theorem_(probability_theory)"}
