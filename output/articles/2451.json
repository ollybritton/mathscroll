{"title":"Cesàro summation","summary":"In mathematical analysis, Cesàro summation (also known as the Cesàro mean[1][2]) assigns values to some infinite sums that are not necessarily convergent in the usual sense. The Cesàro sum is defined as the limit, as n tends to infinity, of the sequence of arithmetic means of the first n partial sums of the series.","image":"548835a1d47d9829b180e1deda337ebf1bade908.svg","url":"Cesàro_summation"}
