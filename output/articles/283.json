{"title":"Absolutely simple group","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a group is said to be absolutely simple if it has no proper nontrivial serial subgroups.[1] That is, G {\\displaystyle G} is an absolutely simple group if the only serial subgroups of G {\\displaystyle G} are { e } {\\displaystyle \\{e\\}} (the trivial subgroup), and G {\\displaystyle G} itself (the whole group).","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Absolutely_simple_group"}
