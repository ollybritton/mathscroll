{"title":"Greedy coloring","summary":"In the study of graph coloring problems in mathematics and computer science, a greedy coloring or sequential coloring[1] is a coloring of the vertices of a graph formed by a greedy algorithm that considers the vertices of the graph in sequence and assigns each vertex its first available color. Greedy colorings can be found in linear time, but they do not, in general, use the minimum number of colors possible.","image":"Greedy_colourings.svg.png.webp","url":"Greedy_coloring"}
