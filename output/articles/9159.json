{"title":"Legendre sieve","summary":"In mathematics, the Legendre sieve, named after Adrien-Marie Legendre, is the simplest method in modern sieve theory.  It applies the concept of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find upper or lower bounds on the number of primes within a given set of integers.  Because it is a simple extension of Eratosthenes' idea, it is sometimes called the Legendreâ€“Eratosthenes sieve.[1]","image":"f7c5af8a6bdcf2d406218e985b7996f8fd37f2a9.svg","url":"Legendre_sieve"}
