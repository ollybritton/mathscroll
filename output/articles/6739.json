{"title":"HP-18C","summary":"The HP-18C was a Hewlett-Packard business calculator which was quickly followed by the very similar but greatly improved HP-19B.  The HP-18C was HP's first RPL-based calculator internally,[1] even though this was not visible on user-level in this non user-programmable model. The user did have a solver (another HP first) available, but only had about 1.5 KB of continuous memory available to store equations.","image":"HP_18C_Calculator.jpg.webp","url":"HP-18C"}
