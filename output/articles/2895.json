{"title":"Combinatorial optimization","summary":"Combinatorial optimization is a subfield of mathematical optimization   that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects,[1] where the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to a discrete set. Typical combinatorial optimization problems are the travelling salesman problem (\"TSP\"), the minimum spanning tree problem (\"MST\"), and the knapsack problem. In many such problems, such as the ones previously mentioned, exhaustive search is not tractable, and so specialized algorithms that quickly rule out large parts of the search space or approximation algorithms must be resorted to instead.","image":"Internet_map_1024.jpg.webp","url":"Combinatorial_optimization"}
