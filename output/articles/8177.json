{"title":"Jacobsthal number","summary":"In mathematics, the Jacobsthal numbers are an integer sequence named after the German mathematician Ernst Jacobsthal.  Like the related Fibonacci numbers, they are a specific type of Lucas sequence U n ( P , Q ) {\\displaystyle U_{n}(P,Q)} for which P = 1, and Q = −2[1]—and are defined by a similar recurrence relation: in simple terms, the sequence starts with 0 and 1, then each following number is found by adding the number before it to twice the number before that.  The first Jacobsthal numbers are:","image":"c9acf94bbc2c8e51474c0b61e79469aa6049fcf0.svg","url":"Jacobsthal_number"}
