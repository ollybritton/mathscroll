{"title":"Regularly ordered","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, an ordered vector space X {\\displaystyle X} is said to be regularly ordered and its order is called regular if X {\\displaystyle X} is Archimedean ordered and the order dual of X {\\displaystyle X} distinguishes points in X {\\displaystyle X} .[1] Being a regularly ordered vector space is an important property in the theory of topological vector lattices.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Regularly_ordered"}
