{"title":"Hyperperfect number","summary":"In mathematics, a k-hyperperfect number is a natural number n for which the equality n = 1 + k(σ(n)  − n  − 1) holds, where σ(n) is the divisor function (i.e., the sum of all positive divisors of n). A hyperperfect number is a k-hyperperfect number for some integer k. Hyperperfect numbers generalize perfect numbers, which are 1-hyperperfect.[1]","image":"27b3af208b148139eefc03f0f80fa94c38c5af45.svg","url":"Hyperperfect_number"}
