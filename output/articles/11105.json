{"title":"Nilpotent operator","summary":"In operator theory, a bounded operator T on a Hilbert space is said to be nilpotent if Tn = 0 for some n. It is said to be quasinilpotent  or topologically  nilpotent if its spectrum Ïƒ(T) = {0}.","image":"bfa52db09bbe914763a9e9683aa30c08499b3c34.svg","url":"Nilpotent_operator"}
