{"title":"Hales–Jewett theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Hales–Jewett theorem is a fundamental combinatorial result of Ramsey theory named after Alfred W. Hales and Robert I. Jewett, concerning the degree to which high-dimensional objects must necessarily exhibit some combinatorial structure; it is impossible for such objects to be \"completely random\".[1]","image":"Line_in_combinatorics.png.webp","url":"Hales–Jewett_theorem"}
