{"title":"Expansive homeomorphism","summary":"In mathematics, the notion of expansivity formalizes the notion of points moving away from one another under the action of an iterated function. The idea of expansivity is fairly rigid, as the definition of positive expansivity, below, as well as the Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick theorem demonstrate.","image":"cb4d7a16bca9e216c0221b43a1c3377aa5e358b8.svg","url":"Expansive_homeomorphism"}
