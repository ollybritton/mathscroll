{"title":"Thaine's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Thaine's theorem is an analogue of Stickelberger's theorem for real abelian fields, introduced by Thaine (1988). Thaine's method has been used to shorten the proof of the Mazur–Wiles theorem (Washington 1997), to prove that some Tate–Shafarevich groups are finite, and in the proof of Mihăilescu's theorem (Schoof 2008).","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Thaine's_theorem"}
