{"title":"5-orthoplex honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 5-space, the 5-orthoplex honeycomb is one of five paracompact regular space-filling tessellations (or honeycombs). It is called paracompact because it has infinite vertex figures, with all vertices as ideal points at infinity.  With Schl√§fli symbol {3,3,3,4,3}, it has three 5-orthoplexes around each cell. It is dual to the 24-cell honeycomb honeycomb.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"5-orthoplex_honeycomb"}
