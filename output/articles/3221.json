{"title":"Conjugate (square roots)","summary":"In mathematics, the conjugate of an expression of the form a + b d {\\displaystyle a+b{\\sqrt {d}}} is a âˆ’ b d , {\\displaystyle a-b{\\sqrt {d}},} provided that d {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {d}}} does not appear in a and b. One says also that the two expressions are conjugate.","image":"2e6c46254eee2978b88135fbd1d75e89d836dbcc.svg","url":"Conjugate_(square_roots)"}
