{"title":"Chinese postman problem","summary":"In graph theory, a branch of mathematics and computer science, Guan's route problem, the Chinese postman problem, postman tour  or route inspection problem is to find a shortest closed path or circuit that visits every edge of an (connected) undirected graph at least once. When the graph has an Eulerian circuit (a closed walk that covers every edge once), that circuit is an optimal solution. Otherwise, the optimization problem is to find the smallest number of graph edges to duplicate (or the subset of edges with the minimum possible total weight) so that the resulting multigraph does have an Eulerian circuit.[1] It can be solved in polynomial time.[2]","image":"2d08a96767187f36fdaadcf693336cfe707f2ca5.svg","url":"Chinese_postman_problem"}
