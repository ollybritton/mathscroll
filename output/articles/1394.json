{"title":"Bayesian experimental design","summary":"Bayesian experimental design provides a general probability-theoretical framework from which other theories on experimental design can be derived. It is based on Bayesian inference to interpret the observations/data acquired during the experiment. This allows accounting for both any prior knowledge on the parameters to be determined as well as uncertainties in observations.","image":"228647b7d4a18b6c8c0c390b439a61da8fafec76.svg","url":"Bayesian_experimental_design"}
