{"title":"Barycentric-sum problem","summary":"Combinatorial number theory deals with number theoretic problems which involve combinatorial ideas in their formulations or solutions. Paul Erd≈ës is the main founder of this branch of number theory. Typical topics include covering system, zero-sum problems, various restricted sumsets, and arithmetic progressions in a set of integers. Algebraic or analytic methods are powerful in this field.","image":"e5073995dface6fb94824a8bec0075e65205fc64.svg","url":"Barycentric-sum_problem"}
