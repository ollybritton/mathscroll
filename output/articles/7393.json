{"title":"Homotopy principle","summary":"In mathematics, the homotopy principle (or h-principle) is a very general way to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), and more generally partial differential relations (PDRs).  The h-principle is good for underdetermined PDEs or PDRs, such as the immersion problem, isometric immersion problem, fluid dynamics, and other areas.","image":"MorinSurfaceAsSphere'sInsideVersusOutside.PNG.webp","url":"Homotopy_principle"}
