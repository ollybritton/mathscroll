{"title":"Series–parallel graph","summary":"In graph theory, series–parallel graphs are graphs with two distinguished vertices called terminals, formed recursively by two simple composition operations. They can be used to model series and parallel electric circuits.","image":"Series_parallel_composition.svg.png.webp","url":"Series–parallel_graph"}
