{"title":"Poincaré series (modular form)","summary":"In number theory, a Poincaré series is a mathematical series generalizing the classical theta series that is associated to any discrete group of symmetries of a complex domain, possibly of several complex variables.  In particular, they generalize classical Eisenstein series.  They are named after Henri Poincaré.","image":"bca4afdbcaed0f917fddee767db42f91ba113b56.svg","url":"Poincaré_series_(modular_form)"}
