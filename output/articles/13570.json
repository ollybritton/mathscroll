{"title":"Riesz representation theorem","summary":"The Riesz representation theorem, sometimes called the Riesz–Fréchet representation theorem after Frigyes Riesz and Maurice René Fréchet, establishes an important connection between a Hilbert space and its continuous dual space. If the underlying field is the real numbers, the two are isometrically isomorphic; if the underlying field is the complex numbers, the two are isometrically anti-isomorphic. The (anti-) isomorphism is a particular natural isomorphism.","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Riesz_representation_theorem"}
