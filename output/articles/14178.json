{"title":"Sequential decoding","summary":"Recognised by John Wozencraft, sequential decoding is a limited memory technique for decoding tree codes.   Sequential decoding is mainly used as an approximate decoding algorithm for long constraint-length convolutional codes.  This approach may not be as accurate as the Viterbi algorithm but can save a substantial amount of computer memory. It was used to decode a convolutional code in 1968 Pioneer 9 mission.","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Sequential_decoding"}
