{"title":"Smooth algebra","summary":"In algebra, a commutative k-algebra A is said to be 0-smooth if it satisfies the following lifting property: given a k-algebra C, an ideal N of C whose square is zero and a k-algebra map u : A → C / N {\\displaystyle u:A\\to C/N} , there exists a k-algebra map v : A → C {\\displaystyle v:A\\to C} such that u is v followed by the canonical map. If there exists at most one such lifting v, then A is said to be 0-unramified (or 0-neat). A is said to be 0-étale if it is 0-smooth and 0-unramified. The notion of 0-smoothness is also called formal smoothness.","image":"535756eb3ea663b52df2fbca688ac707fc7687a9.svg","url":"Smooth_algebra"}
