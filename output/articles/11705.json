{"title":"PSL(2,7)","summary":"In mathematics, the projective special linear group PSL(2, 7), isomorphic to GL(3, 2), is a finite simple group that has important applications in algebra, geometry, and number theory. It is the automorphism group of the Klein quartic as well as the symmetry group of the Fano plane. With 168 elements, PSL(2, 7) is the smallest nonabelian simple group after the alternating group A5 with 60 elements, isomorphic to PSL(2, 5).","image":"bdea12bb18d7a09ac8d6a494d2ce15f658f11c5e.svg","url":"PSL(2,7)"}
