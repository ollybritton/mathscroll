{"title":"Beta normal form","summary":"In the lambda calculus, a term is in beta normal form if no beta reduction is possible.[1] A term is in beta-eta normal form if neither a beta reduction nor an eta reduction is possible. A term is in head normal form if there is no beta-redex in head position. The normal form of a term, if one exists, is unique (as a corollary of the Churchâ€“Rosser theorem).[2] However, a term may have more than one head normal form.","image":"2c3e3f4f81aa779dcedcbf20cd59a631c3678555.svg","url":"Beta_normal_form"}
