{"title":"Association scheme","summary":"The theory of association schemes arose in statistics, in the theory of experimental design for the analysis of variance.[1][2][3] In mathematics, association schemes belong to both algebra and combinatorics. In algebraic combinatorics, association schemes provide a unified approach to many topics, for example combinatorial designs and the theory of error-correcting codes.[4][5] In algebra, association schemes generalize groups, and the theory of association schemes generalizes the character theory of linear representations of groups.[6][7][8]","image":"fa20981dc453f9149a49c9ba38ef25f5674150d9.svg","url":"Association_scheme"}
