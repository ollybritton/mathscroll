{"title":"Komlós–Major–Tusnády approximation","summary":"In probability theory, the Komlós–Major–Tusnády approximation (also known as the KMT approximation, the KMT embedding, or the Hungarian embedding) refers to one of the two strong embedding theorems: 1) approximation of random walk by a standard Brownian motion constructed on the same probability space, and  2) an approximation of the empirical process by a Brownian bridge constructed on the same probability space. It is named after Hungarian mathematicians János Komlós, Gábor Tusnády, and Péter Major, who proved it in 1975.","image":"e6b87fd8b17c2bc22bce8b49f0e969881f858ed6.svg","url":"Komlós–Major–Tusnády_approximation"}
