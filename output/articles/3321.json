{"title":"Continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space","summary":"In mathematical analysis, and especially functional analysis, a fundamental role is played by the space of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space X {\\displaystyle X} with values in the real or complex numbers.  This space, denoted by C ( X ) , {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}(X),} is a vector space with respect to the pointwise addition of functions and scalar multiplication by constants.  It is, moreover, a normed space with norm defined by","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Continuous_functions_on_a_compact_Hausdorff_space"}
