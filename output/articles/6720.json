{"title":"Gödel numbering for sequences","summary":"In mathematics, a Gödel numbering for sequences provides an effective way to represent each finite sequence of natural numbers as a single natural number. While a set theoretical embedding is surely possible, the emphasis is on the effectiveness of the functions manipulating such representations of sequences: the operations on sequences (accessing individual members, concatenation) can be \"implemented\" using total recursive functions, and in fact by primitive recursive functions.","image":"8e31d4cff9528c4d47d3b2df029354d316d7b872.svg","url":"Gödel_numbering_for_sequences"}
