{"title":"Canadian traveller problem","summary":"In computer science and graph theory, the Canadian traveller problem (CTP) is a generalization of the shortest path problem to graphs that are partially observable. In other words, a \"traveller\" on a given point on the graph cannot see the full graph, only adjacent nodes or a certain \"realization restriction.\"","image":"84381600aecc4906b36537ac79200e0ae15ab1c2.svg","url":"Canadian_traveller_problem"}
