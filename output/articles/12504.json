{"title":"Primitive recursive arithmetic","summary":"Primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA) is a quantifier-free formalization of the natural numbers. It was first proposed by Norwegian mathematician Skolem (1923), [1] as a formalization of his finitistic conception of the foundations of arithmetic, and it is widely agreed that all reasoning of PRA is finitistic. Many also believe that all of finitism is captured by PRA,[2] but others believe finitism can be extended to forms of recursion beyond primitive recursion, up to ε0,[3] which is the proof-theoretic ordinal of Peano arithmetic.  PRA's proof theoretic ordinal is ωω, where ω is the smallest transfinite ordinal.  PRA is sometimes called Skolem arithmetic.","image":"e967004bf76a715fb5fe0d3232f9417f66b78b85.svg","url":"Primitive_recursive_arithmetic"}
