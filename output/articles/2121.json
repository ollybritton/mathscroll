{"title":"CW complex","summary":"A CW complex (also called cellular complex or cell complex) is a kind of a topological space that is particularly important in algebraic topology.[1] It was introduced by J. H. C. Whitehead[2] to meet the needs of homotopy theory. This class of spaces is broader and has some better categorical properties than simplicial complexes, but still retains a combinatorial nature that allows for computation (often with a much smaller complex). The C stands for \"closure-finite\", and the W for \"weak\" topology.[2]","image":"0c18b7b1725009da29533875caf1f23f395b0087.svg","url":"CW_complex"}
