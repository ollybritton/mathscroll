{"title":"Polarization of an algebraic form","summary":"In mathematics, in particular in algebra, polarization is a technique for expressing a homogeneous polynomial in a simpler fashion by adjoining more variables.  Specifically, given a homogeneous polynomial, polarization produces a unique symmetric multilinear form from which the original polynomial can be recovered by evaluating along a certain diagonal.","image":"93ae86c82de02c099473240d5a6d31f12b3b8a03.svg","url":"Polarization_of_an_algebraic_form"}
