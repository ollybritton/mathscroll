{"title":"Stabilization hypothesis","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in category theory and algebraic topology, the Baez–Dolan stabilization hypothesis, proposed in (Baez & Dolan 1995), states that suspension of a weak n-category has no more essential effect after n + 2 times.[1] Precisely, it states that the suspension functor n C a t k → n C a t k + 1 {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {nCat}}_{k}\\to {\\mathsf {nCat}}_{k+1}} is an equivalence for k ≥ n + 2 {\\displaystyle k\\geq n+2} .[2]","image":"3e9be4c23d0e15b59cac3e4bb55cc9475e8140fa.svg","url":"Stabilization_hypothesis"}
