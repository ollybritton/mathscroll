{"title":"Preconditioner","summary":"In mathematics, preconditioning is the application of a transformation, called the preconditioner,  that conditions a given problem into a form that is more suitable for numerical solving methods. Preconditioning is typically related to reducing a condition number of the problem. The preconditioned problem is then usually solved by an iterative method.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Preconditioner"}
