{"title":"Local cohomology","summary":"In algebraic geometry, local cohomology is an algebraic analogue of relative cohomology. Alexander Grothendieck introduced it in seminars in Harvard in 1961 written up by Hartshorne (1967), and in 1961-2 at IHES written up as SGA2  - Grothendieck (1968), republished as Grothendieck (2005). Given a function (more generally, a section of a quasicoherent sheaf) defined on an open subset of an algebraic variety (or scheme), local cohomology measures the obstruction to extending that function to a larger domain. The rational function 1 / x {\\displaystyle 1/x} , for example, is defined only on the complement of 0 {\\displaystyle 0} on the affine line A K 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {A} _{K}^{1}} over a field K {\\displaystyle K} , and cannot be extended to a function on the entire space. The local cohomology module H ( x ) 1 ( K [ x ] ) {\\displaystyle H_{(x)}^{1}(K[x])} (where K [ x ] {\\displaystyle K[x]} is the coordinate ring of A K 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {A} _{K}^{1}} ) detects this in the nonvanishing of a cohomology class [ 1 / x ] {\\displaystyle [1/x]} . In a similar manner, 1 / x y {\\displaystyle 1/xy} is defined away from the x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} axes in the affine plane, but cannot be extended to either the complement of the x {\\displaystyle x} -axis or the complement of the y {\\displaystyle y} -axis alone (nor can it be expressed as a sum of such functions); this obstruction corresponds precisely to a nonzero class [ 1 / x y ] {\\displaystyle [1/xy]} in the local cohomology module H ( x , y ) 2 ( K [ x , y ] ) {\\displaystyle H_{(x,y)}^{2}(K[x,y])} .[1]","image":"a55fefc6f37f48a9b4414b09ad3b17dfa739d9e3.svg","url":"Local_cohomology"}
