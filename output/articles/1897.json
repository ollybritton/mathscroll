{"title":"Bounded set (topological vector space)","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, a set in a topological vector space is called bounded or von Neumann bounded, if every neighborhood of the zero vector can be inflated to include the set. A set that is not bounded is called unbounded.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Bounded_set_(topological_vector_space)"}
