{"title":"Baum–Welch algorithm","summary":"In electrical engineering, statistical computing and bioinformatics, the Baum–Welch algorithm is a special case of the expectation–maximization algorithm used to find the unknown parameters of a hidden Markov model (HMM). It makes use of the forward-backward algorithm to compute the statistics for the expectation step.","image":"82120d04dfb3cbadc4912951dd12b5568c9cd8f3.svg","url":"Baum–Welch_algorithm"}
