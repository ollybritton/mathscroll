{"title":"Riemann's differential equation","summary":"In mathematics, Riemann's differential equation, named after Bernhard Riemann, is a generalization of the hypergeometric differential equation, allowing the regular singular points  to occur anywhere on the Riemann sphere, rather than merely at 0, 1, and âˆž {\\displaystyle \\infty } . The equation is also known as the Papperitz equation.[1]","image":"c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21.svg","url":"Riemann's_differential_equation"}
