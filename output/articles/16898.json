{"title":"Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula","summary":"The Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula or sinc interpolation is a method to construct a continuous-time bandlimited function from a sequence of real numbers.  The formula dates back to the works of E. Borel in 1898, and E. T. Whittaker in 1915, and was cited from works of J. M. Whittaker in 1935, and in the formulation of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem by Claude Shannon in 1949.  It is also commonly called Shannon's interpolation formula and Whittaker's interpolation formula.  E. T. Whittaker, who published it in 1915, called it the Cardinal series.","image":"Nyquist_sampling.gif","url":"Whittaker–Shannon_interpolation_formula"}
