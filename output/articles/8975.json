{"title":"Lambda cube","summary":"In mathematical logic and type theory, the λ-cube (also written lambda cube) is a framework introduced by Henk Barendregt[1] to investigate the different dimensions in which the calculus of constructions is a generalization of the simply typed λ-calculus. Each dimension of the cube corresponds to a new kind of dependency between terms and types. Here, \"dependency\" refers to the capacity of a term or type to bind a term or type. The respective dimensions of the λ-cube correspond to:","image":"53e574cc3aa5b4bf5f3f5906caf121a378eef08b.svg","url":"Lambda_cube"}
