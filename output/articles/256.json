{"title":"Abel–Ruffini theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Abel–Ruffini theorem (also known as Abel's impossibility theorem) states that there is no solution in radicals to general polynomial equations of degree five or higher with arbitrary coefficients. Here, general means that the coefficients of the equation are viewed and manipulated as indeterminates.","image":"0f0300136d28f9da40ab77b69ead236e1e8277eb.svg","url":"Abel–Ruffini_theorem"}
