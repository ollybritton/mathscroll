{"title":"Harmonic wavelet transform","summary":"In the mathematics of signal processing, the harmonic wavelet transform, introduced by David Edward Newland in 1993, is a wavelet-based linear transformation of a given function into a time-frequency representation.  It combines advantages of the short-time Fourier transform and the continuous wavelet transform. It can be expressed in terms of repeated Fourier transforms, and its discrete analogue can be computed efficiently using a fast Fourier transform algorithm.","image":"b64481c2e11acddb12ce42249ed80fa185f3450d.svg","url":"Harmonic_wavelet_transform"}
