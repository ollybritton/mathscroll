{"title":"Grothendieck spectral sequence","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of homological algebra, the Grothendieck spectral sequence, introduced by Alexander Grothendieck in his Tôhoku paper, is a  spectral sequence that computes the derived functors of the composition of two functors G ∘ F {\\displaystyle G\\circ F} , from knowledge of the derived functors of F {\\displaystyle F} and G {\\displaystyle G} . Many spectral sequences in algebraic geometry are instances of the Grothendieck spectral sequence, for example the Leray spectral sequence.","image":"9893b421c332c86e71c5279ba248b6ac40ce9711.svg","url":"Grothendieck_spectral_sequence"}
