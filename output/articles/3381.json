{"title":"Convex cap","summary":"A convex cap, also known as a convex floating body[1] or just floating body,[2] is a well defined structure in mathematics commonly used in convex analysis for approximating convex shapes. In general it can be thought of as the intersection of a convex Polytope with a half-space.","image":"4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029.svg","url":"Convex_cap"}
