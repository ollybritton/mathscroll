{"title":"Carleman's condition","summary":"In mathematics, particularly, in analysis, Carleman's condition  gives a sufficient condition for the determinacy of the moment problem. That is, if a measure μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } satisfies Carleman's condition, there is no other measure ν {\\displaystyle \\nu } having the same moments as μ . {\\displaystyle \\mu .} The condition was discovered by Torsten Carleman in 1922.[1]","image":"9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161.svg","url":"Carleman's_condition"}
