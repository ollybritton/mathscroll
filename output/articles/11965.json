{"title":"Pentagonal polytope","summary":"In geometry, a pentagonal polytope is a regular polytope in n dimensions constructed from the Hn Coxeter group. The family was named by H. S. M. Coxeter, because the two-dimensional pentagonal polytope is a pentagon. It can be named by its Schläfli symbol as {5, 3n − 2} (dodecahedral) or {3n − 2, 5} (icosahedral).","image":"4d4d9a872a55b209f2eb7cc23a71e5e1541bd1f4.svg","url":"Pentagonal_polytope"}
