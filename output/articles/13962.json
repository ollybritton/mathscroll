{"title":"Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket","summary":"In differential geometry, the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket, also known as the Schouten bracket, is a type of graded Lie bracket defined on multivector fields on a smooth manifold extending the Lie bracket of vector fields.  There are two  different versions, both rather confusingly called by the same name. The most common version is  defined on alternating multivector fields and makes them into a Gerstenhaber algebra, but there is also another version defined on symmetric multivector fields, which is more or less the same as the Poisson bracket on the cotangent bundle.  It was invented by  Jan Arnoldus Schouten (1940, 1953) and its properties were investigated by his student Albert Nijenhuis (1955). It is related to but not the same as the Nijenhuis–Richardson bracket and the Frölicher–Nijenhuis bracket.","image":"6ec7da61653412823a8594aa7c237dcd681eb42d.svg","url":"Schouten–Nijenhuis_bracket"}
