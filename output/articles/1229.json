{"title":"B8 polytope","summary":"In 8-dimensional geometry, there are 256 uniform polytopes with B8 symmetry. There are two regular forms, the 8-orthoplex and 8-cube, with 16 and 256 vertices respectively. The 8-demicube is added with half the symmetry.","image":"8-cube_t0.svg.png.webp","url":"B8_polytope"}
