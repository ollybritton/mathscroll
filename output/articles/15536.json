{"title":"Tautological bundle","summary":"In mathematics, the tautological bundle is a vector bundle occurring over a Grassmannian in a natural tautological way: for a Grassmannian of k {\\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspaces of V {\\displaystyle V} , given a point in the Grassmannian corresponding to a k {\\displaystyle k} -dimensional vector subspace W âŠ† V {\\displaystyle W\\subseteq V} , the fiber over W {\\displaystyle W} is the subspace W {\\displaystyle W} itself. In the case of projective space the tautological bundle is known as the tautological line bundle.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Tautological_bundle"}
