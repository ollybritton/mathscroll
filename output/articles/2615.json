{"title":"Christofides algorithm","summary":"The Christofides algorithm or Christofidesâ€“Serdyukov algorithm is an algorithm for finding approximate solutions to the travelling salesman problem, on instances where the distances form a metric space (they are symmetric and obey the triangle inequality).[1] It is an approximation algorithm that guarantees that its solutions will be within a factor of 3/2 of the optimal solution length, and is named after Nicos Christofides and Anatoliy I. Serdyukov, who discovered it independently in 1976.[2][3][4]","image":"Metrischer_Graph_mit_5_Knoten.svg.png.webp","url":"Christofides_algorithm"}
