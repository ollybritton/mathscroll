{"title":"Kleene–Brouwer order","summary":"In descriptive set theory, the Kleene–Brouwer order or Lusin–Sierpiński order[1] is a linear order on finite sequences over some linearly ordered set ( X , < ) {\\displaystyle (X,<)} , that differs from the more commonly used lexicographic order in how it handles the case when one sequence is a prefix of the other. In the Kleene–Brouwer order, the prefix is later than the longer sequence containing it, rather than earlier.","image":"a06a913707358013e41f176121fbfc0c1e3c78ef.svg","url":"Kleene–Brouwer_order"}
