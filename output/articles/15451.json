{"title":"TFNP","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the complexity class TFNP is the class of total function problems which can be solved in nondeterministic polynomial time. That is, it is the class of function problems that are guaranteed to have an answer, and this answer can be checked in polynomial time, or equivalently it is the subset of FNP where a solution is guaranteed to exist. The abbreviation TFNP stands for \"Total Function Nondeterministic Polynomial\".","image":"301a9269a06a3ab84ee0e7750a0802d457901aad.svg","url":"TFNP"}
