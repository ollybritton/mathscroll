{"title":"Alternating planar algebra","summary":"The concept of alternating planar algebras first appeared in the work of Hernando Burgos-Soto[1] on the Jones polynomial of alternating tangles. Alternating planar algebras provide an appropriate algebraic framework for other knot invariants in cases the elements involved in the computation are alternating. The concept has been used in extending to tangles some properties of Jones polynomial and Khovanov homology of alternating links.","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Alternating_planar_algebra"}
