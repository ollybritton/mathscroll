{"title":"Atlas (topology)","summary":"In mathematics, particularly topology, one describes a manifold using an atlas. An atlas consists of individual charts that, roughly speaking, describe individual regions of the manifold. If the manifold is the surface of the Earth, then an atlas has its more common meaning. In general, the notion of atlas underlies the formal definition of a manifold and related structures such as vector bundles and other fiber bundles.","image":"33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e.svg","url":"Atlas_(topology)"}
