{"title":"Klee's measure problem","summary":"In computational geometry, Klee's measure problem is the problem of determining how efficiently the measure of a union of (multidimensional) rectangular ranges can be computed. Here, a d-dimensional rectangular range is defined to be a Cartesian product of d intervals of real numbers, which is a subset of Rd.","image":"Set_of_rectangles_(Klee's_Trellis).svg.png.webp","url":"Klee's_measure_problem"}
