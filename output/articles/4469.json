{"title":"Doyle spiral","summary":"In the mathematics of circle packing, a Doyle spiral is a pattern of non-crossing circles in the plane in which each circle is surrounded by a ring of six tangent circles. These patterns contain spiral arms formed by circles linked through opposite points of tangency, with their centers on logarithmic spirals of three different shapes.","image":"PSM_V79_D459_Logarithmic_spiral_in_flower_growth_configuration.png.webp","url":"Doyle_spiral"}
