{"title":"Twistor correspondence","summary":"In mathematical physics, the twistor correspondence or Penroseâ€“Ward correspondence is a bijection between instantons on complexified Minkowski space and holomorphic vector bundles on twistor space, which as a complex manifold is P 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} ^{3}} , or complex projective 3-space. Twistor space was introduced by Roger Penrose, while Richard Ward formulated the correspondence between instantons and vector bundles on twistor space.","image":"7fb80175bc622b3936c7a0438fc690b2ec410b4f.svg","url":"Twistor_correspondence"}
