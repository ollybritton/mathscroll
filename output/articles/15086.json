{"title":"Stochastic geometry","summary":"In mathematics, stochastic geometry is the study of random spatial patterns. At the heart of the subject lies the study of random point patterns. This leads to the theory of spatial point processes, hence notions of Palm conditioning, which extend to the more abstract setting of random measures.","image":"BooleanCellCoverage.svg.png.webp","url":"Stochastic_geometry"}
