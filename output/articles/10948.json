{"title":"Nathaniel Bowditch","summary":"Nathaniel Bowditch (March 26, 1773 â€“ March 16, 1838) was an early American mathematician remembered for his work on ocean navigation. He is often credited as the founder of modern maritime navigation; his book The New American Practical Navigator, first published in 1802, is still carried on board every commissioned U.S. Naval vessel. In 2001, an elementary and middle school in Salem was named in his honor.","image":"Nathaniel_Bowditch_(1773-1838%2C_last_and_unfinished_painting_by_Gilbert_Stuart%2C_1828).jpg.webp","url":"Nathaniel_Bowditch"}
