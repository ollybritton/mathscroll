{"title":"Loop space","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, the loop space ΩX of a pointed topological space X is the space of (based) loops in X, i.e. continuous pointed maps from the pointed circle S1 to X, equipped with the compact-open topology. Two loops can be multiplied by concatenation. With this operation, the loop space is an A∞-space. That is, the multiplication is homotopy-coherently associative.","image":"e696bc0ea2dc0062c945f5cd93c70906347278d4.svg","url":"Loop_space"}
