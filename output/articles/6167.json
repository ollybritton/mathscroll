{"title":"Geometrically (algebraic geometry)","summary":"In algebraic geometry, especially in scheme theory, a property is said to hold geometrically over a field if it also holds over the algebraic closure of the field. In other words, a property holds geometrically if it holds after a base change to a geometric point. For example, a smooth variety is a variety that is geometrically regular.","image":"b9d875c6f9cbb63c2444c62eafad14db2794b1b9.svg","url":"Geometrically_(algebraic_geometry)"}
