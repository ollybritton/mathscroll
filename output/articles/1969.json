{"title":"Breusch–Godfrey test","summary":"In statistics, the Breusch–Godfrey test is used to assess the validity of some of the modelling assumptions inherent in applying regression-like models to observed data series.[1][2]  In particular, it tests for the presence of serial correlation that has not been included in a proposed model structure and which, if present, would mean that incorrect conclusions would be drawn from other tests or that sub-optimal estimates of model parameters would be obtained.","image":"fb2a9f366ccd14dd5a458cb03f586ee67544c656.svg","url":"Breusch–Godfrey_test"}
