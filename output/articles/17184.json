{"title":"Zipf–Mandelbrot law","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the Zipf–Mandelbrot law is a discrete probability distribution. Also known as the Pareto–Zipf law, it is a power-law distribution on ranked data, named after the linguist George Kingsley Zipf who suggested a simpler distribution called Zipf's law, and the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who subsequently generalized it.","image":"9695f2f531e8f62752cab72d2bf86196812eaa36.svg","url":"Zipf–Mandelbrot_law"}
