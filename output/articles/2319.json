{"title":"Catalan's triangle","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, Catalan's triangle is a number triangle whose entries C ( n , k ) {\\displaystyle C(n,k)} give the number of strings consisting of n X's and k Y's such that no initial segment of the string has more Y's than X's. It is a generalization of the Catalan numbers, and is named after Eug√®ne Charles Catalan. Bailey[1] shows that C ( n , k ) {\\displaystyle C(n,k)} satisfy the following properties:","image":"0156b716afda8988cc95572986f147917c3b8fe5.svg","url":"Catalan's_triangle"}
