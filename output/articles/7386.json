{"title":"Homotopy extension property","summary":"In mathematics, in the area of algebraic topology, the homotopy extension property indicates which homotopies defined on a subspace can be extended to a homotopy defined on a larger space.  The homotopy extension property of cofibrations is dual to the homotopy lifting property that is used to define fibrations.","image":"98c6c570e3a2c130fc8d968160962b5e0fe4b0e0.svg","url":"Homotopy_extension_property"}
