{"title":"Wigner surmise","summary":"In mathematical physics, the Wigner surmise is a statement about the probability distribution of the spaces between points in the spectra of nuclei of heavy atoms, which have many degrees of freedom, or quantum systems with few degrees of freedom but chaotic classical dynamics. It was proposed by Eugene Wigner in probability theory.[1] The surmise was a result of Wigner's introduction of random matrices in the field of nuclear physics. The surmise consists of two postulates:","image":"2ca92c8335100f2e8e57c2c8d6acb14721a7505a.svg","url":"Wigner_surmise"}
