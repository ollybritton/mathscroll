{"title":"Schwarz–Christoffel mapping","summary":"In complex analysis,  a Schwarz–Christoffel mapping is a conformal map of the  upper half-plane or the complex unit disk onto the interior of a simple polygon. Such a map is guaranteed to exist by the Riemann mapping theorem (stated by Bernhard Riemann in 1851); the Schwarz–Christoffel formula provides an explicit construction. They were introduced independently by Elwin Christoffel in 1867 and  Hermann Schwarz in 1869.","image":"28075b7339fbed3492c4dc27538e15c91306c51c.svg","url":"Schwarz–Christoffel_mapping"}
