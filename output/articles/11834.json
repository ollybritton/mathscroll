{"title":"Partial fractions in complex analysis","summary":"In complex analysis, a partial fraction expansion is a way of writing a meromorphic function f ( z ) {\\displaystyle f(z)} as an infinite sum of rational functions and polynomials. When f ( z ) {\\displaystyle f(z)} is a rational function, this reduces to the usual method of partial fractions.","image":"d8dd568d570b390c337c0a911f0a1c5c214e8240.svg","url":"Partial_fractions_in_complex_analysis"}
