{"title":"Three-dimensional space","summary":"In geometry, a three-dimensional space (3D space, 3-space or, rarely, tri-dimensional space) is a mathematical space in which three values (coordinates) are required to determine the position of a point. Most commonly, it is the three-dimensional Euclidean space, the Euclidean n-space of dimension n=3 that models physical space. More general three-dimensional spaces are called 3-manifolds.","image":"Coord_planes_color.svg.png.webp","url":"Three-dimensional_space"}
