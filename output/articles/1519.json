{"title":"Besov space","summary":"In mathematics, the Besov space (named after Oleg Vladimirovich Besov) B p , q s ( R ) {\\displaystyle B_{p,q}^{s}(\\mathbf {R} )} is a complete quasinormed space which is a Banach space when 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞.  These spaces, as well as the similarly defined Triebel–Lizorkin spaces, serve to generalize more elementary function spaces such as Sobolev spaces and are effective at measuring regularity properties of functions.","image":"69d05a4fab3712cb9f4528ebf8ec3255304fef2f.svg","url":"Besov_space"}
