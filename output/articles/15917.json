{"title":"Total variation distance of probability measures","summary":"In probability theory, the total variation distance is a distance measure for probability distributions. It is an example of a statistical distance metric, and is sometimes called the statistical distance, statistical difference or variational distance.","image":"4af05190f6fb10d1eec88b5f66f940dc88b5ec87.svg","url":"Total_variation_distance_of_probability_measures"}
