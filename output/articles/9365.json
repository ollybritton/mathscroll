{"title":"Linear independence","summary":"In the theory of vector spaces,  a set of vectors is said to be .mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#b1d2ff}linearly independent if there exists no nontrivial linear combination of the vectors that equals the zero vector. If such a linear combination exists, then the vectors are said to be linearly dependent. These concepts are central to the definition of dimension.[1]","image":"Vec-indep.png.webp","url":"Linear_independence"}
