{"title":"Artin's criterion","summary":"In mathematics, Artin's criteria[1][2][3][4] are a collection of related necessary and sufficient conditions on deformation functors which prove the representability of these functors as either Algebraic spaces[5] or as Algebraic stacks. In particular, these conditions are used in the construction of the moduli stack of elliptic curves[6] and the construction of the moduli stack of pointed curves.[7]","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Artin's_criterion"}
