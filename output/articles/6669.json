{"title":"Gun (cellular automaton)","summary":"In a cellular automaton, a gun is a pattern with a main part that repeats periodically, like an oscillator, and that also periodically emits spaceships. There are then two periods that may be considered: the period of the spaceship output, and the period of the gun itself, which is necessarily a multiple of the spaceship output's period. A gun whose period is larger than the period of the output is a pseudoperiod gun.","image":"Day_and_night.gif","url":"Gun_(cellular_automaton)"}
