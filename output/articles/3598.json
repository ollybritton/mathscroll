{"title":"Cube-connected cycles","summary":"In graph theory, the cube-connected cycles is an undirected cubic graph, formed by replacing each vertex of a hypercube graph by a cycle. It was introduced by Preparata & Vuillemin (1981) for use as a network topology in parallel computing.","image":"Cube-connected_cycles.svg.png.webp","url":"Cube-connected_cycles"}
