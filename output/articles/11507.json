{"title":"Order-6 triangular hosohedral honeycomb","summary":"In geometry, the order-6 triangular hosohedral honeycomb a regular space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) with Schl√§fli symbol {2,3,6}. It has 6 triangular hosohedra {2,3} around each edge. It is a degenerate honeycomb in Euclidean space, but can be seen as a projection onto the sphere. Its vertex figure, a triangular tiling is seen on each hemisphere.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Order-6_triangular_hosohedral_honeycomb"}
