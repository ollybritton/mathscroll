{"title":"Group algebra of a locally compact group","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, the group algebra is any of various constructions to assign to a locally compact group  an operator algebra (or more generally a Banach algebra), such that representations of the algebra are related to representations of the group.  As such, they are similar to the group ring associated to a discrete group.","image":"fec7f312d8e5a03ede4d2733df315ef76e06a5e2.svg","url":"Group_algebra_of_a_locally_compact_group"}
