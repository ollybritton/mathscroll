{"title":"Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations","summary":"Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations are methods used to find numerical approximations to the solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Their use is also known as \"numerical integration\", although this term can also refer to the computation of integrals.","image":"Numerical_integration_illustration%2C_step%3D1.svg.png.webp","url":"Numerical_methods_for_ordinary_differential_equations"}
