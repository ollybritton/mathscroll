{"title":"Character module","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra, every module has an associated character module. Using the associated character module it is possible to investigate the properties of the original module. One of the main results discovered by Joachim Lambek shows that a module is flat if and only if the associated character module is injective.[1]","image":"559b4ec7de6ec4883b9d47f7ce9ded2d366d1c1e.svg","url":"Character_module"}
