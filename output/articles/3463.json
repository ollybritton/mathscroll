{"title":"Correspondence theorem","summary":"In group theory, the correspondence theorem[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] (also the lattice theorem,[9] and variously and ambiguously the third and fourth isomorphism theorem[6][10]) states that if N {\\displaystyle N} is a normal subgroup of a group G {\\displaystyle G} , then there exists a bijection from the set of all subgroups A {\\displaystyle A} of G {\\displaystyle G} containing N {\\displaystyle N} , onto the set of all subgroups of the quotient group G / N {\\displaystyle G/N} .  Loosely speaking, the structure of the subgroups of G / N {\\displaystyle G/N} is exactly the same as the structure of the subgroups of G {\\displaystyle G} containing N {\\displaystyle N} , with N {\\displaystyle N} collapsed to the identity element.","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Correspondence_theorem"}
