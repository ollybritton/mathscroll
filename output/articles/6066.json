{"title":"Generalized chi-squared distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the generalized chi-squared distribution (or generalized chi-square distribution) is the distribution of a quadratic form of a  multinormal variable (normal vector), or a linear combination of different normal variables and squares of normal variables. Equivalently, it is also a linear sum of independent noncentral chi-square variables and a normal variable. There are several other such generalizations for which the same term is sometimes used; some of them are special cases of the family discussed here, for example the gamma distribution.","image":"Generalized_chi-square_PDF.svg.png.webp","url":"Generalized_chi-squared_distribution"}
