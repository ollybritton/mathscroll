{"title":"Landau's function","summary":"In mathematics, Landau's function g(n), named after Edmund Landau, is defined for every natural number n to be the largest order of an element of the symmetric group Sn. Equivalently, g(n) is the largest least common multiple (lcm) of any partition of n, or the maximum number of times a permutation of n elements can be recursively applied to itself before it returns to its starting sequence.","image":"2a6607cfd642ebb29827c36fd9548909148568c9.svg","url":"Landau's_function"}
