{"title":"Deltoid curve","summary":"In geometry, a deltoid curve, also known as a tricuspoid curve or Steiner curve, is a hypocycloid of three cusps. In other words, it is the roulette created by a point on the circumference of a circle as it rolls without slipping along the inside of a circle with three or one-and-a-half times its radius. It is named after the capital Greek letter delta (Î”) which it resembles.","image":"Deltoid2.gif","url":"Deltoid_curve"}
