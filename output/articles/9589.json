{"title":"Liénard–Chipart criterion","summary":"In control system theory, the Liénard–Chipart criterion is a stability criterion modified from the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion, proposed by A. Liénard and M. H. Chipart.[1] This criterion has a computational advantage over the Routh–Hurwitz criterion because it involves only about half the number of determinant computations.[2]","image":"8b6e022130678b95fb57a74fefd45e69d65bfacc.svg","url":"Liénard–Chipart_criterion"}
