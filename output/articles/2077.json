{"title":"Butcher group","summary":"In mathematics,  the Butcher group, named after the New Zealand mathematician John C. Butcher by Hairer & Wanner (1974), is an infinite-dimensional  Lie group[1] first introduced in numerical analysis to study solutions of non-linear ordinary differential equations by the Rungeâ€“Kutta method. It arose from an algebraic formalism involving rooted trees that provides formal power series solutions of the differential equation modeling the flow of a vector field. It was Cayley (1857), prompted by the work of Sylvester on change of variables in differential calculus, who first noted that the derivatives of a composition of functions can be conveniently expressed in terms of rooted trees and their combinatorics.","image":"Caylrich-first-trees.png.webp","url":"Butcher_group"}
