{"title":"Quaternion","summary":"In mathematics, the quaternion number system extends the complex numbers. Quaternions were first described by the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton in 1843[1][2] and applied to mechanics in three-dimensional space. Hamilton defined a quaternion as the quotient of two directed lines in a three-dimensional space,[3] or, equivalently, as the quotient of two vectors.[4] Multiplication of quaternions is noncommutative.","image":"Cayley_Q8_quaternion_multiplication_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Quaternion"}
