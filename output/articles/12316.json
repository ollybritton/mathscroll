{"title":"Polygonal chain","summary":"In geometry, a polygonal chain[lower-alpha 1] is a connected series of line segments. More formally, a polygonal chain P {\\displaystyle P} is a curve specified by a sequence of points ( A 1 , A 2 , â€¦ , A n ) {\\displaystyle (A_{1},A_{2},\\dots ,A_{n})} called its vertices. The curve itself consists of the line segments connecting the consecutive vertices.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Polygonal_chain"}
