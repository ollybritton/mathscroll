{"title":"Reaction–diffusion system","summary":"Reaction–diffusion systems are mathematical models which correspond to several physical phenomena. The most common is the change in space and time of the concentration of one or more chemical substances: local chemical reactions in which the substances are transformed into each other, and diffusion which causes the substances to spread out over a surface in space.","image":"Reaction-Diffusion.gif","url":"Reaction–diffusion_system"}
