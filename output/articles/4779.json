{"title":"Elongated pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda","summary":"In geometry, the elongated pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J41). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda (J33) by inserting a decagonal prism between its halves. Rotating either the pentagonal cupola (J5) or the pentagonal rotunda (J6) through 36Â degrees before inserting the prism yields an elongated pentagonal orthocupolarotunda  (J40).","image":"Elongated_pentagonal_gyrocupolarotunda.png.webp","url":"Elongated_pentagonal_gyrocupolarotunda"}
