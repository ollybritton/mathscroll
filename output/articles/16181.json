{"title":"Truncated tetrahedral prism","summary":"In geometry, a truncated tetrahedral prism is a convex uniform polychoron (four-dimensional polytope). This polychoron has 10 polyhedral cells: 2 truncated tetrahedra connected by 4 triangular prisms and 4 hexagonal prisms. It has 24 faces: 8 triangular, 18 square, and 8 hexagons. It has 48 edges and 24 vertices.","image":"Truncated_tetrahedral_prism.png.webp","url":"Truncated_tetrahedral_prism"}
