{"title":"Back-of-the-envelope calculation","summary":"A back-of-the-envelope calculation is a rough calculation, typically jotted down on any available scrap of paper such as an envelope. It is more than a guess but less than an accurate calculation or mathematical proof. The defining characteristic of back-of-the-envelope calculations is the use of simplified assumptions.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Back-of-the-envelope_calculation"}
