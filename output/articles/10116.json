{"title":"Mathematics of cyclic redundancy checks","summary":"The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is based on division in the ring of polynomials over the finite field GF(2) (the integers modulo 2), that is, the set of polynomials where each coefficient is either zero or one, and arithmetic operations wrap around.","image":"150d38e238991bc4d0689ffc9d2a852547d2658d.svg","url":"Mathematics_of_cyclic_redundancy_checks"}
