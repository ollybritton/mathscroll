{"title":"Topological game","summary":"In mathematics, a topological game is an infinite game of perfect information played between two players on a topological space. Players choose objects with topological properties such as points, open sets, closed sets and open coverings. Time is generally discrete, but the plays may have transfinite lengths, and extensions to continuum time have been put forth. The conditions for a player to win can involve notions like topological closure and convergence.","image":"bed0ca261bbcf7a66a7eaef5af7534ec48b9da05.svg","url":"Topological_game"}
