{"title":"Hidato","summary":"Hidato (Hebrew: חידאתו, originating from the Hebrew word Hida = Riddle), also known as \"Hidoku\",[1][2][3] is a logic puzzle game invented by Dr. Gyora M. Benedek, an Israeli mathematician.[4][5] The goal of Hidato is to fill the grid with consecutive numbers that connect horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.[6]  The name Hidato is a registered trademark of Doo-Bee Toys and Games LTD, a company co-founded by Benedek himself.[5][7] Some publishers use different names for this puzzle such as Number Snake, Snakepit (both of which play on the game's similarity in concept to the video game Snake), Jadium or Numbrix.","image":"Hidato-Puzzle.svg.png.webp","url":"Hidato"}
