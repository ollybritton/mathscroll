{"title":"Computation in the limit","summary":"In computability theory, a function is called limit computable if it is the limit of a uniformly computable sequence of functions.  The terms computable in the limit, limit recursive and recursively approximable are also used.  One can think of limit computable functions as those admitting an eventually correct computable guessing procedure at their true value.  A set is limit computable just when its characteristic function is limit computable.","image":"0d457e88abd861f46ede37d27c4669c747367109.svg","url":"Computation_in_the_limit"}
