{"title":"Wavelet transform","summary":"In mathematics, a wavelet series is a representation of a square-integrable (real- or complex-valued) function by a certain orthonormal series generated by a wavelet. This article provides a formal, mathematical definition of an orthonormal wavelet and of the integral wavelet transform.[1][2][3][4][5]","image":"Jpeg2000_2-level_wavelet_transform-lichtenstein.png.webp","url":"Wavelet_transform"}
