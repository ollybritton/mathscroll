{"title":"Malliavin's absolute continuity lemma","summary":"In mathematics — specifically, in measure theory — Malliavin's absolute continuity lemma is a result due to the French mathematician Paul Malliavin that plays a foundational rôle in the regularity (smoothness) theorems of the Malliavin calculus.  Malliavin's lemma gives a sufficient condition for a finite Borel measure to be absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure.","image":"b0ad9eaefe65fa6ffa6ba3335c7e46e8ccf72678.svg","url":"Malliavin's_absolute_continuity_lemma"}
