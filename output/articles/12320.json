{"title":"Polyhedral complex","summary":"In mathematics, a polyhedral complex is a set of polyhedra in a real vector space that fit together in a specific way.[1]  Polyhedral complexes generalize simplicial complexes and arise in various areas of polyhedral geometry, such as tropical geometry, splines and hyperplane arrangements.","image":"3a70fc5d5ef4fa8ce694447bef39c1aa167a68b2.svg","url":"Polyhedral_complex"}
