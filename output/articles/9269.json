{"title":"Lie bracket of vector fields","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential topology, the Lie bracket of vector fields, also known as the Jacobiâ€“Lie bracket or the commutator of vector fields, is an operator that assigns to any two vector fields X and Y on a smooth manifold M a third vector field denoted [X, Y].","image":"fd1e6c305b263c2c55fdac7e57f69fbc6a505c4d.svg","url":"Lie_bracket_of_vector_fields"}
