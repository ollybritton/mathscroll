{"title":"K-epsilon turbulence model","summary":"K-epsilon (k-Îµ) turbulence model is the most common model used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate mean flow characteristics for turbulent flow conditions. It is a two equation model that gives a general description of turbulence by means of two transport equations (partial differential equations, PDEs). The original impetus for the K-epsilon model was to improve the mixing-length model, as well as to find an alternative to algebraically prescribing turbulent length scales in moderate to high complexity flows.[1]","image":"a1d280fdf59921775a0ed681337278adc5bb39aa.svg","url":"K-epsilon_turbulence_model"}
