{"title":"Archimedean group","summary":"In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, an Archimedean group is a linearly ordered group for which the Archimedean property holds: every two positive group elements are bounded by integer multiples of each other. The set R of real numbers together with the operation of addition and the usual ordering relation between pairs of numbers is an Archimedean group. By a result of Otto HÃ¶lder, every Archimedean group is isomorphic to a subgroup of this group. The name \"Archimedean\" comes from Otto Stolz, who named the Archimedean property after its appearance in the works of Archimedes.[1]","image":"87dc5ad0c38811603e54fb6eee1583282b7db6dd.svg","url":"Archimedean_group"}
