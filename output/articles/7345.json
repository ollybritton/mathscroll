{"title":"Holonomy","summary":"In differential geometry, the holonomy of a connection on a smooth manifold is a general geometrical consequence of the curvature of the connection measuring the extent to which parallel transport around closed loops fails to preserve the geometrical data being transported.  For flat connections, the associated holonomy is a type of monodromy and is an inherently global notion.  For curved connections, holonomy has nontrivial local and global features.","image":"Holonomy-vis-with-label.png.webp","url":"Holonomy"}
