{"title":"Morphism of algebraic varieties","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a morphism between algebraic varieties is a function between the varieties that is given locally by polynomials. It is also called a regular map. A morphism from an algebraic variety to the affine line is also called a regular function. A regular map whose inverse is also regular is called biregular, and the biregular maps are the isomorphisms of algebraic varieties. Because regular and biregular are very restrictive conditions – there are no non-constant regular functions on projective varieties – the concepts of rational and birational maps are widely used as well; they are  partial functions that are defined locally by rational fractions instead of polynomials.","image":"d64ccca0c6fbd18be5d4ec26e26efd89e9c0d76e.svg","url":"Morphism_of_algebraic_varieties"}
