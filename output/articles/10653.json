{"title":"Monoid factorisation","summary":"In mathematics, a factorisation of a free monoid is a sequence of subsets of words with the property that every word in the free monoid can be written as a concatenation of elements drawn from the subsets.  The Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem states that the Lyndon words furnish a factorisation.  The Schützenberger theorem relates the definition in terms of a multiplicative property to an additive property.","image":"f1f86f47539a16577b8f59a6421c73216a0c11d4.svg","url":"Monoid_factorisation"}
