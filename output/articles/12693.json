{"title":"Prüfer sequence","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, the Prüfer sequence (also Prüfer code or Prüfer numbers) of a labeled tree is a unique sequence associated with the tree.  The sequence for a tree on n vertices has length n − 2, and can be generated by a simple iterative algorithm.  Prüfer sequences were first used by Heinz Prüfer to prove Cayley's formula in 1918.[1]","image":"Tree_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Prüfer_sequence"}
