{"title":"Morrie's law","summary":"Morrie's law is a special trigonometric identity. Its name is due to the physicist Richard Feynman, who used to refer to the identity under that name. Feynman picked that name because he learned it during his childhood from a boy with the name Morrie Jacobs and afterwards remembered it for all of his life.[1]","image":"12d3945713c37535275a81eddfe98ba839344ecf.svg","url":"Morrie's_law"}
