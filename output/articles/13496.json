{"title":"Ricci decomposition","summary":"In the mathematical fields of Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian geometry, the Ricci decomposition is a way of breaking up the Riemann curvature tensor of a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold into pieces with special algebraic properties.  This decomposition is of fundamental importance in Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian geometry.","image":"352ddcf408fcf109e79764d4b5d3760449c1a95e.svg","url":"Ricci_decomposition"}
