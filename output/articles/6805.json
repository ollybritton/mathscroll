{"title":"Halanay inequality","summary":"Halanay inequality is a comparison theorem for differential equations with delay.[1] This inequality and its generalizations have been applied to analyze the stability of delayed differential equations, and in particular, the stability of industrial processes with dead-time[2] and delayed neural networks.[3][4]","image":"02d3006c4190b1939b04d9b9bb21006fb4e6fa4a.svg","url":"Halanay_inequality"}
