{"title":"Heptagrammic-order heptagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the heptagrammic-order heptagonal tiling is a regular star-tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It has Schl√§fli symbol of {7,7/2}. The vertex figure heptagrams are {7/2}, . The heptagonal faces overlap with density 3.","image":"Obtuse_heptagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Heptagrammic-order_heptagonal_tiling"}
