{"title":"Stechkin's lemma","summary":"In mathematics – more specifically, in functional analysis and numerical analysis – Stechkin's lemma is a result about the ℓq norm of the tail of a sequence, when the whole sequence is known to have finite ℓp norm.  Here, the term \"tail\" means those terms in the sequence that are not among the N largest terms, for an arbitrary natural number N.  Stechkin's lemma is often useful when analysing best-N-term approximations to functions in a given basis of a function space.  The result was originally proved by Stechkin in the case q = 2 {\\displaystyle q=2} .","image":"26622af6012fb982cab4e9584f57dd4f364233b7.svg","url":"Stechkin's_lemma"}
