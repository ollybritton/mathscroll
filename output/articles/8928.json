{"title":"L10a140 link","summary":"In the mathematical theory of knots, L10a140 is the name in the Thistlethwaite link table of a link of three loops, which has ten crossings between the loops when presented in its simplest visual form.[1] It is of interest because it is presumably the simplest link which possesses the Brunnian property — a link of connected components that, when one component is removed, becomes entirely unconnected[2] — other than the six-crossing Borromean rings.[3]","image":"Brunnian-L10a140.svg.png.webp","url":"L10a140_link"}
