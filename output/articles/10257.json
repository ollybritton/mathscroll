{"title":"Mean line segment length","summary":"In geometry, the mean line segment length is the average length of a line segment connecting two points chosen uniformly at random in a given shape. In other words, it is the expected Euclidean distance between two random points, where each point in the shape is equally likely to be chosen.","image":"3e11b67e676087b0089836969c7429aed3ef672b.svg","url":"Mean_line_segment_length"}
