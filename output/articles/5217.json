{"title":"Exterior derivative","summary":"On a differentiable manifold, the exterior derivative extends the concept of the differential of a function to differential forms of higher degree. The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by Ã‰lie Cartan in 1899. The resulting calculus, known as exterior calculus, allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of Stokes' theorem, Gauss's theorem, and Green's theorem from vector calculus.","image":"191277e0b4a0587a0d76e89fb02f5b15e6773552.svg","url":"Exterior_derivative"}
