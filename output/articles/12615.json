{"title":"Projective line","summary":"In mathematics, a projective line is, roughly speaking, the extension of a usual line by a point called a point at infinity. The statement and the proof of many theorems of geometry are simplified by the resultant elimination of special cases; for example, two distinct projective lines in a projective plane meet in exactly one point (there is no \"parallel\" case).","image":"09404e16ef9ccccd05414dabeedac84b306fe9e4.svg","url":"Projective_line"}
