{"title":"Dawson–Gärtner theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Dawson–Gärtner theorem is a result in large deviations theory.  Heuristically speaking, the Dawson–Gärtner theorem allows one to transport a large deviation principle on a “smaller” topological space to a “larger” one.","image":"bc87832e2be7ebfa57ecb2a4515baaedf77df7c3.svg","url":"Dawson–Gärtner_theorem"}
