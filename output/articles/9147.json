{"title":"Legendre's conjecture","summary":"Legendre's conjecture, proposed by Adrien-Marie Legendre, states that there is a prime number between n 2 {\\displaystyle n^{2}} and ( n + 1 ) 2 {\\displaystyle (n+1)^{2}} for every positive integer n {\\displaystyle n} .  The conjecture is one of Landau's problems (1912) on prime numbers; as of 2022, the conjecture has neither been proved nor disproved.","image":"ac9810bbdafe4a6a8061338db0f74e25b7952620.svg","url":"Legendre's_conjecture"}
