{"title":"Brillouin and Langevin functions","summary":"The Brillouin and Langevin functions are a pair of special functions that appear when studying an idealized paramagnetic material in statistical mechanics. These functions are named after French physicists Paul Langevin and LÃ©on Brillouin who contributed to the microscopic understanding of magnetic properties of matter.","image":"ac96b505f93f0e82b32894e1906ae0a39e404156.svg","url":"Brillouin_and_Langevin_functions"}
