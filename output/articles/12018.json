{"title":"Perfect totient number","summary":"In number theory, a perfect totient number is an integer that is equal to the sum of its iterated totients.  That is, we apply the totient function to a number n, apply it again to the resulting totient, and so on, until the number 1 is reached, and add together the resulting sequence of numbers; if the sum equals n, then n is a perfect totient number.","image":"900cd6c776893c236ce9c2bbec0c221e889006c2.svg","url":"Perfect_totient_number"}
