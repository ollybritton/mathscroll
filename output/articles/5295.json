{"title":"Fast-growing hierarchy","summary":"In computability theory, computational complexity theory and proof theory, a fast-growing hierarchy (also called an extended Grzegorczyk hierarchy) is an ordinal-indexed family of rapidly increasing functions fα: N → N (where N is the set of natural numbers {0, 1, ...}, and α ranges up to some large countable ordinal). A primary example is the Wainer hierarchy, or Löb–Wainer hierarchy, which is an extension to all α < ε0.  Such hierarchies provide a natural way to classify computable functions according to rate-of-growth and computational complexity.","image":"cfcb0f004d6404cd0f841d84d28cfb00adc876ed.svg","url":"Fast-growing_hierarchy"}
