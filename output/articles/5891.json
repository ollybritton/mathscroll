{"title":"G-measure","summary":"In mathematics, a G-measure is a measure μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } that can be represented as the weak-∗ limit of a sequence of measurable functions G = ( G n ) n = 1 ∞ {\\displaystyle G=\\left(G_{n}\\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty }} . A classic example is the Riesz product","image":"9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161.svg","url":"G-measure"}
