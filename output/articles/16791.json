{"title":"Wedge sum","summary":"In topology, the wedge sum is a \"one-point union\" of a family of topological spaces. Specifically, if X and Y are pointed spaces (i.e. topological spaces with distinguished basepoints x 0 {\\displaystyle x_{0}} and y 0 {\\displaystyle y_{0}} ) the wedge sum of X and Y is the quotient space of the disjoint union of X and Y by the identification x 0 âˆ¼ y 0 : {\\displaystyle x_{0}\\sim y_{0}:}","image":"86f21d0e31751534cd6584264ecf864a6aa792cf.svg","url":"Wedge_sum"}
