{"title":"NP (complexity)","summary":"In computational complexity theory, NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) is a complexity class used to classify decision problems.  NP is the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, where the answer is \"yes\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine, or alternatively the set of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.[2][Note 1]","image":"a1901b28a80b347f99116fe2f6f93093dd37218f.svg","url":"NP_(complexity)"}
