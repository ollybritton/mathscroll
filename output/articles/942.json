{"title":"Archimedean graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, an Archimedean graph is a graph that forms the skeleton of one of the Archimedean solids. There are 13 Archimedean graphs, and all of them are regular, polyhedral (and therefore by necessity also 3-vertex-connected planar graphs), and also Hamiltonian graphs.[1]","image":"Tuncated_tetrahedral_graph.png.webp","url":"Archimedean_graph"}
