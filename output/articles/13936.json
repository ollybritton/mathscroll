{"title":"Schauder basis","summary":"In mathematics, a Schauder basis or countable basis is similar to the usual (Hamel) basis of a vector space; the difference is that Hamel bases use linear combinations that are finite sums, while for Schauder bases they may be infinite sums. This makes Schauder bases more suitable for the analysis of infinite-dimensional topological vector spaces including Banach spaces.","image":"3ed3aa25d01cb27c8419e7a167e52a64033f35c7.svg","url":"Schauder_basis"}
