{"title":"Little q-Jacobi polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the little q-Jacobi polynomials  pn(x;a,b;q) are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme, introduced by Hahn (1949). Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties.","image":"936b15abe3947fe92e8ee467de3023828985f12d.svg","url":"Little_q-Jacobi_polynomials"}
