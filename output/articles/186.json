{"title":"Sudoku","summary":"Sudoku (/suːˈdoʊkuː, -ˈdɒk-, sə-/; Japanese: 数独, romanized: sūdoku, lit. 'digit-single'; originally called Number Place)[1] is a logic-based,[2][3] combinatorial[4] number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", or \"regions\") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.","image":"Sudoku_Puzzle_by_L2G-20050714_standardized_layout.svg.png.webp","url":"A%2fSudoku"}
