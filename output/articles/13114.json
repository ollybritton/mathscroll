{"title":"Rank (linear algebra)","summary":"In linear algebra, the rank of a matrix A is the dimension of the vector space generated (or spanned) by its columns.[1][2][3] This corresponds to the maximal number of linearly independent columns of A. This, in turn, is identical to the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows.[4] Rank is thus a measure of the \"nondegenerateness\" of the system of linear equations and linear transformation encoded by A. There are multiple equivalent definitions of rank. A matrix's rank is one of its most fundamental characteristics.","image":"aed80a2011a3912b028ba32a52dfa57165455f24.svg","url":"Rank_(linear_algebra)"}
