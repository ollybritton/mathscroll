{"title":"Decision-theoretic rough sets","summary":"In the mathematical theory of decisions, decision-theoretic rough sets (DTRS) is a probabilistic extension of rough set classification.  First created in 1990 by Dr. Yiyu Yao,[1] the extension makes use of loss functions to derive α {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\alpha } and β {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\beta } region parameters. Like rough sets, the lower and upper approximations of a set are used.","image":"45728a083749011217ec42e1bcfbe76ebdbe8c18.svg","url":"Decision-theoretic_rough_sets"}
