{"title":"Boolean algebra (structure)","summary":"In abstract algebra, a Boolean algebra or Boolean lattice is a complemented distributive lattice. This type of algebraic structure captures essential properties of both set operations and logic operations. A Boolean algebra can be seen as a generalization of a power set algebra or a field of sets, or its elements can be viewed as generalized truth values. It is also a special case of a De Morgan algebra and a Kleene algebra (with involution).","image":"Hasse_diagram_of_powerset_of_3.svg.png.webp","url":"Boolean_algebra_(structure)"}
