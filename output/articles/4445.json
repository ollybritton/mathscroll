{"title":"Double exponential function","summary":"A double exponential function is a constant raised to the power of an exponential function.  The general formula is f ( x ) = a b x = a ( b x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)=a^{b^{x}}=a^{(b^{x})}} (where a>1 and b>1), which grows much more quickly than an exponential function. For example, if a = b = 10:","image":"6d686647ff4b19b1669aa6bb6d97fa552cb258dc.svg","url":"Double_exponential_function"}
