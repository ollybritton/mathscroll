{"title":"Clebsch surface","summary":"In mathematics, the Clebsch diagonal cubic surface, or Klein's icosahedral cubic surface, is a non-singular cubic surface, studied by Clebsch (1871) and Klein (1873), all of whose 27 exceptional lines can be defined over the real numbers. The term Klein's icosahedral surface can refer to either this surface or its blowup at the 10 Eckardt points.","image":"Clebsch_Cubic.png.webp","url":"Clebsch_surface"}
