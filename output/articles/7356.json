{"title":"Homogeneous polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, a homogeneous polynomial, sometimes called quantic in older texts, is a polynomial whose nonzero terms all have the same degree.[1] For example, x 5 + 2 x 3 y 2 + 9 x y 4 {\\displaystyle x^{5}+2x^{3}y^{2}+9xy^{4}} is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5, in two variables; the sum of the exponents in each term is always 5. The polynomial x 3 + 3 x 2 y + z 7 {\\displaystyle x^{3}+3x^{2}y+z^{7}} is not homogeneous, because the sum of exponents does not match from term to term. The function defined by a homogeneous polynomial is always a homogeneous function.","image":"51db9a7b25751430fe980a07982859492343788a.svg","url":"Homogeneous_polynomial"}
