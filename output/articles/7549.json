{"title":"Hyponormal operator","summary":"In mathematics, especially operator theory, a hyponormal operator is a generalization of a normal operator. In general, a bounded linear operator T on a complex Hilbert space H is said to be p-hyponormal ( 0 < p â‰¤ 1 {\\displaystyle 0<p\\leq 1} ) if:","image":"e2351d19b9e7a7132cc2efdb3033dbbe6487d47f.svg","url":"Hyponormal_operator"}
