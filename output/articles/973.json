{"title":"Arithmetic Fuchsian group","summary":"Arithmetic Fuchsian groups are a special class of Fuchsian groups constructed using orders in quaternion algebras. They are particular instances of arithmetic groups. The prototypical example of an arithmetic Fuchsian group is the modular group P S L 2 ( Z ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {PSL} _{2}(\\mathbb {Z} )} . They, and the hyperbolic surface associated to their action on the hyperbolic plane often exhibit particularly regular behaviour among Fuchsian groups and hyperbolic surfaces.","image":"2a4b9cf6287ab69794ffadc0a669da5424bc78ba.svg","url":"Arithmetic_Fuchsian_group"}
