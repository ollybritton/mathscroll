{"title":"Confluent hypergeometric function","summary":"In mathematics, a confluent hypergeometric function is a solution of a confluent hypergeometric equation, which is a degenerate form of a hypergeometric differential equation where two of the three regular singularities merge into an irregular singularity. The term confluent refers to the merging of singular points of families of differential equations; confluere is Latin for \"to flow together\". There are several common standard forms of confluent hypergeometric functions:","image":"Plot_of_the_Kummer_confluent_hypergeometric_function_1F1(a%3Bb%3Bz)_with_a%3D1_and_b%3D2_and_input_z²_with_1F1(1%2C2%2Cz²)_in_the_complex_plane_from_-2-2i_to_2%2B2i_with_colors_created_with_Mathematica_13.1.svg.png.webp","url":"Confluent_hypergeometric_function"}
