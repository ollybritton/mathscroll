{"title":"Snub 24-cell honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the snub 24-cell honeycomb, or snub icositetrachoric honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) by snub 24-cells, 16-cells, and 5-cells. It was discovered by Thorold Gosset with his 1900 paper of semiregular polytopes. It is not semiregular by Gosset's definition of regular facets, but all of its cells (ridges) are regular, either tetrahedra or icosahedra.","image":"CDel_node_h.png.webp","url":"Snub_24-cell_honeycomb"}
