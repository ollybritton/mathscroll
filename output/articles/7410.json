{"title":"Hopf manifold","summary":"In complex geometry, a Hopf manifold (Hopf 1948)  is obtained as a quotient of the complex vector space (with zero deleted) ( C n ∖ 0 ) {\\displaystyle ({\\mathbb {C} }^{n}\\backslash 0)} by a free action of the group Γ ≅ Z {\\displaystyle \\Gamma \\cong {\\mathbb {Z} }} of integers, with the generator γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } of Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } acting by holomorphic contractions. Here, a holomorphic contraction is a map γ : C n → C n {\\displaystyle \\gamma :\\;{\\mathbb {C} }^{n}\\to {\\mathbb {C} }^{n}} such that a sufficiently big iteration γ N {\\displaystyle \\;\\gamma ^{N}} maps any given compact subset of C n {\\displaystyle {\\mathbb {C} }^{n}} onto an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of 0.","image":"a4a18ceedaf24b4b88ac6515d6029b374b1b1afb.svg","url":"Hopf_manifold"}
