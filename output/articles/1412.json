{"title":"Beck's monadicity theorem","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, Beck's monadicity theorem gives a criterion that characterises monadic functors, introduced by Jonathan Mock BeckÂ (2003) in about 1964. It is often stated in dual form for comonads.  It is sometimes called the Beck tripleability theorem because of the older term triple for a monad.","image":"1853a97c0e00b76d2e5b541856f7a58b5b171f6d.svg","url":"Beck's_monadicity_theorem"}
