{"title":"Cycle graph","summary":"In graph theory, a cycle graph or circular graph is a graph that consists of a single cycle, or in other words, some number of vertices (at least 3, if the graph is simple) connected in a closed chain. The cycle graph with n vertices is called Cn.[2] The number of vertices in Cn equals the number of edges, and every vertex has degree 2; that is, every vertex has exactly two edges incident with it.","image":"13e64b6aafd3a4c2587d94dbdf586e12c6e023ab.svg","url":"Cycle_graph"}
