{"title":"Indicator function","summary":"In mathematics, an indicator function or a characteristic function of a subset of a set is a function that maps elements of the subset to one, and all other elements to zero. That is, if A is a subset of some set X, then 1 A ( x ) = 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {1} _{A}(x)=1} if x ∈ A , {\\displaystyle x\\in A,} and 1 A ( x ) = 0 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {1} _{A}(x)=0} otherwise, where 1 A {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {1} _{A}} is a common notation for the indicator function. Other common notations are I A , {\\displaystyle I_{A},} and χ A . {\\displaystyle \\chi _{A}.}","image":"9394f68a77dda0cf344969bc54ab234bb18f3ae6.svg","url":"Indicator_function"}
