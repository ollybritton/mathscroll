{"title":"Barber paradox","summary":"The barber paradox is a puzzle derived from Russell's paradox. It was used by Bertrand Russell as an illustration of the paradox, though he attributes it to an unnamed person who suggested it to him.[1] The puzzle shows that an apparently plausible scenario is logically impossible. Specifically, it describes a barber who is defined such that he both shaves himself and does not shave himself, which implies that no such barber exists.[2][3]","image":"1525ce550edf609765ef15550f96ad6cededec51.svg","url":"Barber_paradox"}
