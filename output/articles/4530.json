{"title":"Duoprism","summary":"In geometry of 4 dimensions or higher, a double prism[1] or duoprism is a polytope resulting from the Cartesian product of two polytopes, each of two dimensions or higher. The Cartesian product of an n-polytope and an m-polytope is an (n+m)-polytope, where n and m are dimensions of 2 (polygon) or higher.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Duoprism"}
