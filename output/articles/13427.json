{"title":"Resolvent (Galois theory)","summary":"In Galois theory, a discipline within the field of abstract algebra, a resolvent for a permutation group G is a polynomial whose coefficients depend polynomially on the coefficients of a given polynomial p and has, roughly speaking, a rational root if and only if the Galois group of p is included in G. More exactly, if the Galois group is included in G, then the resolvent has a rational root, and the converse is true if the rational root is a simple root. Resolvents were introduced by  Joseph Louis Lagrange and systematically used by Ã‰variste Galois. Nowadays they are still a fundamental tool to compute Galois groups. The simplest examples of resolvents are","image":"1826c554ebcdc3b9bb856efc0b208037b6cab7e3.svg","url":"Resolvent_(Galois_theory)"}
