{"title":"Order type","summary":"In mathematics, especially in set theory, two ordered sets X and Y are said to have the same order type if they are order isomorphic, that is, if there exists a bijection (each element pairs with exactly one in the other set) f : X â†’ Y {\\displaystyle f\\colon X\\to Y} such that both f and its inverse are monotonic (preserving orders of elements). In the special case when X is totally ordered, monotonicity of f implies monotonicity of its inverse.","image":"07b9ff205beb51e7899846aeae788ae5e5546a3e.svg","url":"Order_type"}
