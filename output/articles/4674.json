{"title":"Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second derivative","summary":"Explicit formulas for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second derivative with different boundary conditions are provided both for the continuous and discrete cases. In the discrete case, the standard central difference approximation of the second derivative is used on a uniform grid.","image":"c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21.svg","url":"Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors_of_the_second_derivative"}
