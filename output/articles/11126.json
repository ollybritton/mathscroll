{"title":"No-three-in-line problem","summary":"The no-three-in-line problem in discrete geometry asks how many points can be placed in the n Ã— n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} grid so that no three points lie on the same line. The problem concerns lines of all slopes, not only those aligned with the grid. It was introduced by Henry Dudeney in 1900. Brass, Moser, and Pach call it \"one of the oldest and most extensively studied geometric questions concerning lattice points\".[1]","image":"59d2b4cb72e304526cf5b5887147729ea259da78.svg","url":"No-three-in-line_problem"}
