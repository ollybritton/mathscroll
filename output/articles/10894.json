{"title":"NIP (model theory)","summary":"In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, a complete theory T is said to satisfy NIP (\"not the independence property\") if none of its formulae satisfy the independence propertyâ€”that is, if none of its formulae can pick out any given subset of an arbitrarily large finite set.","image":"11e9a5c58250c7f205977a281cf4ad432e5429d2.svg","url":"NIP_(model_theory)"}
