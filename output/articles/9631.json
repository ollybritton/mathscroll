{"title":"Locally constant sheaf","summary":"In algebraic topology, a locally constant sheaf on a topological space X is a sheaf F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} on X such that for each x in X, there is an open neighborhood U of x such that the restriction F | U {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}|_{U}} is a constant sheaf on U. It is also called a local system. When X is a stratified space, a constructible sheaf is roughly a sheaf that is locally constant on each member of the stratification.","image":"205d4b91000d9dcf1a5bbabdfa6a8395fa60b676.svg","url":"Locally_constant_sheaf"}
