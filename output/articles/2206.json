{"title":"Cap product","summary":"In algebraic topology the cap product is a method of adjoining a chain of degree p with a cochain of degree q, such that q ≤ p, to form a composite chain of degree p − q.   It was introduced by Eduard Čech in 1936, and independently by Hassler Whitney in 1938.","image":"ae05f962b47151860a22b5adfcb3d62b21120631.svg","url":"Cap_product"}
