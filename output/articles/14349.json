{"title":"Sigma-additive set function","summary":"In mathematics, an additive set function is a function mapping sets to numbers, with the property that its value on a union of two disjoint sets equals the sum of its values on these sets, namely, μ ( A ∪ B ) = μ ( A ) + μ ( B ) . {\\textstyle \\mu (A\\cup B)=\\mu (A)+\\mu (B).} If this additivity property holds for any two sets, then it also holds for any finite number of sets, namely, the function value on the union of k disjoint sets (where k is a finite number) equals the sum of its values on the sets. Therefore, an additive set function is also called a finitely additive set function (the terms are equivalent). However, a finitely additive set function might not have the additivity property for a union of an infinite number of sets. A σ-additive set function is a function that has the additivity property even for countably infinite many sets, that is, μ ( ⋃ n = 1 ∞ A n ) = ∑ n = 1 ∞ μ ( A n ) . {\\textstyle \\mu \\left(\\bigcup _{n=1}^{\\infty }A_{n}\\right)=\\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty }\\mu (A_{n}).}","image":"5c0aa49d9fb2bc89f061913122b791ebb2f4ba73.svg","url":"Sigma-additive_set_function"}
