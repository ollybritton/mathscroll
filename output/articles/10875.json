{"title":"Möbius–Kantor configuration","summary":"In geometry, the Möbius–Kantor configuration is a configuration consisting of eight points and eight lines, with three points on each line and three lines through each point. It is not possible to draw points and lines having this pattern of incidences in the Euclidean plane, but it is possible in the complex projective plane.","image":"Möbius–Kantor_configuration_symmetric.svg.png.webp","url":"Möbius–Kantor_configuration"}
