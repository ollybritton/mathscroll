{"title":"Goldfeld–Quandt test","summary":"In statistics, the Goldfeld–Quandt test checks for homoscedasticity in regression analyses. It does this by dividing a dataset into two parts or groups, and hence the test is sometimes called a two-group test.  The Goldfeld–Quandt test is one of two tests proposed in a 1965 paper by Stephen Goldfeld and Richard Quandt. Both a parametric and nonparametric test are described in the paper, but the term \"Goldfeld–Quandt test\" is usually associated only with the former.","image":"GQplot.svg.png.webp","url":"Goldfeld–Quandt_test"}
