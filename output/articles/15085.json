{"title":"Stochastic dynamic programming","summary":"Originally introduced by Richard E. Bellman in (Bellman 1957), stochastic dynamic programming is a technique for modelling and solving problems of decision making under uncertainty. Closely related to stochastic programming and dynamic programming, stochastic dynamic programming represents the problem under scrutiny in the form of a Bellman equation. The aim is to compute a policy prescribing how to act optimally in the face of uncertainty.","image":"f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3.svg","url":"Stochastic_dynamic_programming"}
