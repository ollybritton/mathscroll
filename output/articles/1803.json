{"title":"Bohemian matrices","summary":"A Bohemian matrix family[1] is a set of matrices whose free entries come from a single discrete, usually finite population, denoted here by P. That is, each entry of any matrix from this particular Bohemian matrix family must be an element of P. Such a matrix is called a Bohemian matrix.  Bohemian matrices can have other structures as well, such as being a Toeplitz matrix or an upper Hessenberg matrix. Usually, only one Bohemian matrix family with a fixed population P is studied at a time, and so one can classify any given matrix as being Bohemian or not, without significant ambiguity.","image":"Exhaustivepop_CubeRootsOfMinusOne_cividis_15N4782969.png.webp","url":"Bohemian_matrices"}
