{"title":"p-adic valuation","summary":"In number theory, the p-adic valuation or p-adic order of an integer n is the exponent of the highest power of the prime number p that divides n. It is denoted ν p ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\nu _{p}(n)} . Equivalently, ν p ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\nu _{p}(n)} is the exponent to which p {\\displaystyle p} appears in the prime factorization of n {\\displaystyle n} .","image":"a740c63898dac75666e43736eb3ae87eb8c62b16.svg","url":"P-adic_valuation"}
