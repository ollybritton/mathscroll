{"title":"Linkless embedding","summary":"In topological graph theory, a mathematical discipline, a linkless embedding of an undirected graph is an embedding of the graph into three-dimensional Euclidean space in such a way that no two cycles of the graph are linked. A flat embedding is an embedding with the property that every cycle is the boundary of a topological disk whose interior is disjoint from the graph. A linklessly embeddable graph is a graph that has a linkless or flat embedding; these graphs form a three-dimensional analogue of the planar graphs.[1] Complementarily, an intrinsically linked graph is a graph that does not have a linkless embedding.","image":"Hopf_Link.png.webp","url":"Linkless_embedding"}
