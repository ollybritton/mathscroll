{"title":"Maximum cardinality matching","summary":"Maximum cardinality matching is a fundamental problem in graph theory.[1] We are given a graph G, and the goal is to find a matching containing as many edges as possible; that is, a maximum cardinality subset of the edges such that each vertex is adjacent to at most one edge of the subset. As each edge will cover exactly two vertices, this problem is equivalent to the task of finding a matching that covers as many vertices as possible.","image":"38928558a21a735dd5fe8c4e87b3af621646eaa2.svg","url":"Maximum_cardinality_matching"}
