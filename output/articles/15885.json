{"title":"Toroidal coordinates","summary":"Toroidal coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from rotating the two-dimensional bipolar coordinate system about the axis that separates its two foci.  Thus, the two foci F 1 {\\displaystyle F_{1}} and F 2 {\\displaystyle F_{2}} in bipolar coordinates become a ring of radius a {\\displaystyle a} in the x y {\\displaystyle xy} plane of the toroidal coordinate system; the z {\\displaystyle z} -axis is the axis of rotation. The focal ring is also known as the reference circle.","image":"100c7fbf174fe8b06eacc2a6b0bb2e1badd1c7ce.svg","url":"Toroidal_coordinates"}
