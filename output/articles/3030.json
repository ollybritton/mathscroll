{"title":"Complex random vector","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, a complex random vector is typically a tuple of complex-valued random variables, and generally is a random variable taking values in a vector space over the field of complex numbers. If Z 1 , … , Z n {\\displaystyle Z_{1},\\ldots ,Z_{n}} are complex-valued random variables, then the n-tuple ( Z 1 , … , Z n ) {\\displaystyle \\left(Z_{1},\\ldots ,Z_{n}\\right)} is a complex random vector. Complex random variables can always be considered as pairs of real random vectors: their real and imaginary parts.","image":"e581860b7dadf563e3b50e7fbc851c2b25e032d8.svg","url":"Complex_random_vector"}
