{"title":"Signature (logic)","summary":"In logic, especially mathematical logic, a signature lists and describes the  non-logical symbols of a formal language. In universal algebra, a signature lists the operations that characterize an algebraic structure. In model theory, signatures are used for both purposes. They are rarely made explicit in more philosophical treatments of logic.","image":"6f02daaf4468932048097873f78c2d18142db880.svg","url":"Signature_(logic)"}
