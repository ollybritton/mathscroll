{"title":"Newman's conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in number theory, Newman's conjecture is a conjecture about the behavior of the partition function modulo any integer.  Specifically, it states that for any integers m and r such that 0 ≤ r ≤ m − 1 {\\displaystyle 0\\leq r\\leq m-1} , the value of the partition function p ( n ) {\\displaystyle p(n)} satisfies the congruence p ( n ) ≡ r ( mod m ) {\\displaystyle p(n)\\equiv r{\\pmod {m}}} for infinitely many non-negative integers n.  It was formulated by mathematician Morris Newman in 1960.[1] It is unsolved as of 2020.","image":"6ede7f4805dcc5e6755c5753d000086b566a0737.svg","url":"Newman's_conjecture"}
