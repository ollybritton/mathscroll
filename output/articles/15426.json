{"title":"Systoles of surfaces","summary":"In mathematics, systolic inequalities for curves on surfaces were first studied by Charles Loewner in 1949 (unpublished; see remark at end of P. M. Pu's paper in '52). Given a closed surface, its systole, denoted sys, is defined to be the least length of a loop that cannot be contracted to a point on the surface.  The systolic area of a metric is defined to be the ratio area/sys2.  The systolic ratio SR is the reciprocal quantity sys2/area.  See also Introduction to systolic geometry.","image":"TorusSystoleLoop.png.webp","url":"Systoles_of_surfaces"}
