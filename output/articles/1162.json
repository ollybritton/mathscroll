{"title":"Automorphic L-function","summary":"In mathematics, an automorphic L-function is a function L(s,π,r) of a complex variable s, associated to an automorphic representation π of a reductive group G over a global field and a finite-dimensional complex representation r of the Langlands dual group LG of G, generalizing the Dirichlet L-series of a Dirichlet character and the Mellin transform of a modular form. They were introduced by Langlands (1967, 1970, 1971).","image":"103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8.svg","url":"Automorphic_L-function"}
