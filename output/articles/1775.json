{"title":"Blossom tree (graph theory)","summary":"In the study of planar graphs, blossom trees are trees with additional directed half edges. Each blossom tree is associated with an embedding of a planar graph. Blossom trees can be used to sample random planar graphs.[1]","image":"Blossom_tree.png.webp","url":"Blossom_tree_(graph_theory)"}
