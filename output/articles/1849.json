{"title":"Borel determinacy theorem","summary":"In descriptive set theory, the Borel determinacy theorem states that any Galeâ€“Stewart game whose payoff set is a Borel set is determined, meaning that one of the two players will have a winning strategy for the game. A Gale-Stewart game is a possibly infinite two-player game, where both players have perfect information and no randomness is involved.","image":"aa22961575af3e7bd1c69fa4fb9180c300085905.svg","url":"Borel_determinacy_theorem"}
