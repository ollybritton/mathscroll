{"title":"Tilde","summary":"The tilde (/ˈtɪldeɪ, -di, -də, ˈtɪld/)[1] ˜ or ~, is a grapheme with several uses. The name of the character came into English from Spanish, which in turn came from the Latin titulus, meaning \"title\" or \"superscription\".[2][lower-alpha 1] Its primary use is as a diacritic (accent) in combination with a base letter; but for historical reasons, it is also used in standalone form within a variety of contexts.","image":"Text_of_Exeter_Domesday_Book_of_1086.jpg.webp","url":"Tilde"}
