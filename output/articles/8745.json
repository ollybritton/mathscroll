{"title":"Klein geometry","summary":"In mathematics, a Klein geometry is a type of geometry motivated by Felix Klein in his influential Erlangen program. More specifically, it is a homogeneous space X together with a transitive action on X by a Lie group G, which acts as the symmetry group of the geometry.","image":"3f0662eb489c79718e7f46a5d40e8152b47a5d23.svg","url":"Klein_geometry"}
