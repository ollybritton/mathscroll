{"title":"Mosco convergence","summary":"In mathematical analysis, Mosco convergence is a notion of convergence for functionals that is used in nonlinear analysis and set-valued analysis. It is a particular case of Γ-convergence. Mosco convergence is sometimes phrased as “weak Γ-liminf and strong Γ-limsup” convergence since it uses both the weak and strong topologies on a topological vector space X. In finite dimensional spaces, Mosco convergence coincides with epi-convergence, while in infinite-dimensional ones, Mosco convergence is strictly stronger property.","image":"3a4d4c53580bc985bb8f868d4e001aa2d871d771.svg","url":"Mosco_convergence"}
