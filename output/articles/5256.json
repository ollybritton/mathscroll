{"title":"Factor-critical graph","summary":"In graph theory, a mathematical discipline, a factor-critical graph (or hypomatchable graph[1][2]) is a graph with n vertices in which every subgraph of n âˆ’ 1 vertices has a perfect matching. (A perfect matching in a graph is a subset of its edges with the property that each of its vertices is the endpoint of exactly one of the edges in the subset.)","image":"Factor_critical.svg.png.webp","url":"Factor-critical_graph"}
