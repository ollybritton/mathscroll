{"title":"T-coloring","summary":"In graph theory, a T-Coloring of a graph G = ( V , E ) {\\displaystyle G=(V,E)} , given the set T of nonnegative integers containing 0, is a function c : V ( G ) → N {\\displaystyle c:V(G)\\to \\mathbb {N} } that maps each vertex to a positive integer (color) such that if u and w are adjacent then | c ( u ) − c ( w ) | ∉ T {\\displaystyle |c(u)-c(w)|\\notin T} .[1] In simple words, the absolute value of the difference between two colors of adjacent vertices must not belong to fixed set T. The concept was introduced by William K. Hale.[2] If T = {0} it reduces to common vertex coloring.","image":"644a8d85ee410b6159ca2bdb5dcb9097e2c8f182.svg","url":"T-coloring"}
