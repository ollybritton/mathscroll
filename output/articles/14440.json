{"title":"Singly and doubly even","summary":"In mathematics an even integer, that is, a number that is divisible by 2, is called evenly even or doubly even if it is a multiple of 4, and oddly even or singly even if it is not.  The former names are traditional ones, derived from ancient Greek mathematics; the latter have become common in recent decades.","image":"882549d47a85fae819e2954b7f5fb594f5a72edf.svg","url":"Singly_and_doubly_even"}
