{"title":"Nowhere continuous function","summary":"In mathematics, a nowhere continuous function, also called an everywhere discontinuous function, is a function that is not continuous at any point of its domain. If f {\\displaystyle f} is a function from real numbers to real numbers, then f {\\displaystyle f} is nowhere continuous if for each point x {\\displaystyle x} there is some ε > 0 {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon >0} such that for every δ > 0 , {\\displaystyle \\delta >0,} we can find a point y {\\displaystyle y} such that | x − y | < δ {\\displaystyle |x-y|<\\delta } and | f ( x ) − f ( y ) | ≥ ε {\\displaystyle |f(x)-f(y)|\\geq \\varepsilon } . Therefore, no matter how close we get to any fixed point, there are even closer points at which the function takes not-nearby values.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Nowhere_continuous_function"}
