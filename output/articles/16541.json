{"title":"Vector logic","summary":"Vector logic[1][2] is an algebraic model of elementary logic based on matrix algebra. Vector logic assumes that the truth values map on vectors, and that the monadic and dyadic operations are executed by matrix operators. \"Vector logic\" has also been used to refer to the representation of classical propositional logic as a vector space,[3][4] in which the unit vectors are propositional variables. Predicate logic can be represented as a vector space of the same type in which the axes represent the predicate letters S {\\displaystyle S} and P {\\displaystyle P} .[5] In the vector space for propositional logic the origin represents the false, F, and the infinite periphery represents the true, T, whereas in the space for predicate logic the origin represents \"nothing\" and the periphery represents the flight from nothing, or \"something\".","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Vector_logic"}
