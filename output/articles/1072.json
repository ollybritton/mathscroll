{"title":"Assembly map","summary":"In mathematics, assembly maps are an important concept in geometric topology. From the homotopy-theoretical viewpoint, an assembly map is a universal approximation of a homotopy invariant functor by a homology theory from the left. From the geometric viewpoint, assembly maps correspond to 'assemble' local data over a parameter space together to get global data.","image":"801f978563b22c31490b813195c34b09e76ea393.svg","url":"Assembly_map"}
