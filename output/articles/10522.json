{"title":"Minlos's theorem","summary":"In the mathematics of topological vector spaces, Minlos's theorem states that a cylindrical measure on the dual of a nuclear space is a Radon measure if its Fourier transform is continuous. It is named after Robert Adol'fovich Minlos and can be proved using Sazonov's theorem.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Minlos's_theorem"}
