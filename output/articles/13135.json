{"title":"Rate of convergence","summary":"In numerical analysis, the order of convergence and the rate of convergence of a convergent sequence are quantities that represent how quickly the sequence approaches its limit. A sequence ( x n ) {\\displaystyle (x_{n})} that converges to x ∗ {\\displaystyle x^{*}} is said to have order of convergence q ≥ 1 {\\displaystyle q\\geq 1} and rate of convergence μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } if","image":"012f44968fa86fe5e3827e9957d957b08f2d9e42.svg","url":"Rate_of_convergence"}
