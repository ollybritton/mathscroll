{"title":"Mixed volume","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically, in convex geometry, the mixed volume is a way to associate a non-negative number to an r {\\displaystyle r} -tuple of convex bodies in n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional space. This number depends on the size and shape of the bodies and on their relative orientation to each other.","image":"0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538.svg","url":"Mixed_volume"}
