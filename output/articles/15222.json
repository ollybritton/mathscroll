{"title":"Successive parabolic interpolation","summary":"Successive parabolic interpolation is a technique for finding the extremum (minimum or maximum) of a continuous unimodal function by successively fitting parabolas (polynomials of degree two) to a function of one variable at three unique points or, in general, a function of n variables at 1+n(n+3)/2 points, and at each iteration replacing the \"oldest\" point with the extremum of the fitted parabola.","image":"Max_paraboloid.svg.png.webp","url":"Successive_parabolic_interpolation"}
