{"title":"Metabiaugmented truncated dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the metabiaugmented truncated dodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (J70). As its name suggests, it is created by attaching two pentagonal cupolas (J5) onto two nonadjacent, nonparallel decagonal faces of a truncated dodecahedron.","image":"Metabiaugmented_truncated_dodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Metabiaugmented_truncated_dodecahedron"}
