{"title":"Elongated pentagonal gyrobirotunda","summary":"In geometry, the elongated pentagonal gyrobirotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J43). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a \"pentagonal gyrobirotunda,\" or icosidodecahedron (one of the Archimedean solids), by inserting a decagonal prism between its congruent halves. Rotating one of the pentagonal rotundae (J6) through 36Â degrees before inserting the prism yields an elongated pentagonal orthobirotunda  (J42).","image":"Elongated_pentagonal_gyrobirotunda.png.webp","url":"Elongated_pentagonal_gyrobirotunda"}
