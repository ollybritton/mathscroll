{"title":"Euler's totient function","summary":"In number theory, Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. It is written using the Greek letter phi as φ ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\varphi (n)} or ϕ ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\phi (n)} , and may also be called Euler's phi function. In other words, it is the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which the greatest common divisor gcd(n, k) is equal to 1.[2][3] The integers k of this form are sometimes referred to as totatives of n.","image":"f067864064667dd5f8b2508b9cbf983d89788629.svg","url":"Euler's_totient_function"}
