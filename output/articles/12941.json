{"title":"Quasiregular polyhedron","summary":"In geometry, a quasiregular polyhedron is a uniform polyhedron that has exactly two kinds of regular faces, which alternate around each vertex. They are vertex-transitive and edge-transitive, hence a step closer to regular polyhedra than the semiregular, which are merely vertex-transitive.","image":"CDel_node.png.webp","url":"Quasiregular_polyhedron"}
