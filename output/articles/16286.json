{"title":"Typed lambda calculus","summary":"A typed lambda calculus is a typed formalism that uses the lambda-symbol ( Î» {\\displaystyle \\lambda } ) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the untyped lambda calculus, but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and untyped lambda calculus a special case with only one type.","image":"b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a.svg","url":"Typed_lambda_calculus"}
