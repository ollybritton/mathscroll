{"title":"Five-point stencil","summary":"In numerical analysis, given a square grid in one or two dimensions, the five-point stencil of a point in the grid is a stencil made up of the point itself together with its four \"neighbors\". It is used to write finite difference approximations to derivatives at grid points. It is an example for numerical differentiation.","image":"Five_point_stencil_illustration.png.webp","url":"Five-point_stencil"}
