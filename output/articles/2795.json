{"title":"Cluster prime","summary":"In number theory, a cluster prime is a prime number p such that every even positive integer k ≤ p − 3 can be written as the difference between two prime numbers not exceeding p (OEIS: A038134). For example, the number 23 is a cluster prime because 23 − 3 = 20, and every even integer from 2 to 20, inclusive, is the difference of at least one pair of prime numbers not exceeding 23:","image":"6f79dcba35ecde0d43fbb7c914165586166ce8c2.svg","url":"Cluster_prime"}
