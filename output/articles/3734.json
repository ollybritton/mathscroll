{"title":"D6 polytope","summary":"In 6-dimensional geometry, there are 47 uniform polytopes with D6 symmetry, of which 16 are unique and 31 are shared with the B6 symmetry. There are two regular forms, the 6-orthoplex, and 6-demicube with 12 and 32 vertices respectively.","image":"6-demicube_t0_D6.svg.png.webp","url":"D6_polytope"}
