{"title":"Rota's conjecture","summary":"Rota's excluded minors conjecture is one of a number of conjectures made by mathematician Gian-Carlo Rota. It is considered to be an important problem by some members of the structural combinatorics community. Rota conjectured in 1971 that, for every finite field, the family of matroids that can be represented over that field has only finitely many excluded minors.[1] A proof of the conjecture has been announced by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle.[2]","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Rota's_conjecture"}
