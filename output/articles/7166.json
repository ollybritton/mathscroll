{"title":"Hexagonal tiling honeycomb","summary":"In the field of hyperbolic geometry, the hexagonal tiling honeycomb is one of 11 regular paracompact honeycombs in 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. It is paracompact because it has cells composed of an infinite number of faces.  Each cell is a hexagonal tiling whose vertices lie on a horosphere, a surface in hyperbolic space that approaches a single ideal point at infinity.","image":"H3_633_FC_boundary.png.webp","url":"Hexagonal_tiling_honeycomb"}
