{"title":"Combinatorial topology","summary":"In mathematics, combinatorial topology was an older name for algebraic topology, dating from the time when topological invariants of spaces (for example the Betti numbers) were regarded as derived from combinatorial decompositions of spaces, such as decomposition into simplicial complexes. After the proof of the simplicial approximation theorem this approach provided rigour.","image":"Kleinsche_Flasche.png.webp","url":"Combinatorial_topology"}
