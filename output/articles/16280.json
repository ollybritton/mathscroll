{"title":"Tychonoff space","summary":"In topology and related branches of mathematics, Tychonoff spaces and completely regular spaces are kinds of topological spaces.  These conditions are examples of separation axioms. A Tychonoff space refers to any completely regular space that is also a Hausdorff space; there exist completely regular spaces that are not Tychonoff (i.e. not Hausdorff).","image":"VollständigRegulärerRaum.png.webp","url":"Tychonoff_space"}
