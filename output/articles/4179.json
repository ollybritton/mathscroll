{"title":"Direct method in the calculus of variations","summary":"In mathematics, the direct method in the calculus of variations is a general method for constructing a proof of the existence of a minimizer for a given functional,[1] introduced by Stanis≈Çaw Zaremba and David Hilbert around 1900. The method relies on methods of functional analysis and topology. As well as being used to prove the existence of a solution, direct methods may be used to compute the solution to desired accuracy.[2]","image":"dfb09f17495a3434cfa6e5b4255889fc6b3f748d.svg","url":"Direct_method_in_the_calculus_of_variations"}
