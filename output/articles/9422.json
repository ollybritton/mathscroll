{"title":"Lipschitz domain","summary":"In mathematics, a Lipschitz domain (or domain with Lipschitz boundary) is a domain in Euclidean space whose boundary is \"sufficiently regular\" in the sense that it can be thought of as locally being the graph of a Lipschitz continuous function. The term is named after the German mathematician Rudolf Lipschitz.","image":"d059936e77a2d707e9ee0a1d9575a1d693ce5d0b.svg","url":"Lipschitz_domain"}
