{"title":"Gibbs sampling","summary":"In statistics, Gibbs sampling or a Gibbs sampler is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for obtaining a sequence of observations which are approximated from a specified multivariate probability distribution, when direct sampling is difficult.  This sequence can be used to approximate the joint distribution (e.g., to generate a histogram of the distribution); to approximate the marginal distribution of one of the variables, or some subset of the variables (for example, the unknown parameters or latent variables); or to compute an integral (such as the expected value of one of the variables).  Typically, some of the variables correspond to observations whose values are known, and hence do not need to be sampled.","image":"Bayes_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Gibbs_sampling"}
