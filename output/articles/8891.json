{"title":"Kurosh subgroup theorem","summary":"In the mathematical field of group theory, the Kurosh subgroup theorem describes the algebraic structure of subgroups of free products of groups. The theorem was obtained by Alexander Kurosh, a Russian mathematician, in 1934.[1] Informally, the theorem says that every subgroup of a free product is itself a free product of a free group and of its intersections with the conjugates of the factors of the original free product.","image":"cb191f3786c871bfef048374a8a086edc16403c6.svg","url":"Kurosh_subgroup_theorem"}
