{"title":"SAMV (algorithm)","summary":"SAMV (iterative sparse asymptotic minimum variance[1][2]) is a parameter-free superresolution algorithm for the linear inverse problem in spectral estimation, direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and tomographic reconstruction with applications in signal processing, medical imaging and remote sensing. The name was coined in 2013[1] to emphasize its basis on the asymptotically minimum variance (AMV) criterion. It is a powerful tool for the recovery of both the amplitude and frequency characteristics of multiple highly correlated sources in challenging environments (e.g., limited number of snapshots and low signal-to-noise ratio). Applications include synthetic-aperture radar,[2][3] computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"SAMV_(algorithm)"}
