{"title":"Computable isomorphism","summary":"In computability theory two sets A ; B ⊆ N {\\displaystyle A;B\\subseteq \\mathbb {N} } of natural numbers are computably isomorphic or recursively isomorphic if there exists a total bijective computable function f : N → N {\\displaystyle f\\colon \\mathbb {N} \\to \\mathbb {N} } with f ( A ) = B {\\displaystyle f(A)=B} . By the Myhill isomorphism theorem,[1] the relation of computable isomorphism coincides with the relation of mutual one-one reducibility.","image":"9050e2453c5bbfdaf6521034705ce5351629f417.svg","url":"Computable_isomorphism"}
