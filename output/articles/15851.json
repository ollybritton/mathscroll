{"title":"Topological geometry","summary":"Topological geometry deals with incidence structures consisting of a point set P {\\displaystyle P} and a family L {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {L}}} of subsets of P {\\displaystyle P} called lines or circles etc. such that both P {\\displaystyle P} and L {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {L}}} carry a topology and all geometric operations like joining points by a line or intersecting lines are continuous. As in the case of topological groups, many deeper results require the point space to be (locally) compact and connected. This generalizes the observation that the line joining two distinct points in the Euclidean plane depends continuously on the pair of points and the intersection point of two lines is a continuous function of these lines.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Topological_geometry"}
