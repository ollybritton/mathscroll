{"title":"Cylindric algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the notion of cylindric algebra, invented by Alfred Tarski, arises naturally in the algebraization of first-order logic with equality. This is comparable to the role Boolean algebras play for propositional logic. Cylindric algebras are Boolean algebras equipped with additional cylindrification operations that model quantification and equality. They differ from polyadic algebras in that the latter do not model equality.","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg","url":"Cylindric_algebra"}
