{"title":"Perpendicular bisector construction of a quadrilateral","summary":"In geometry, the perpendicular bisector construction of a quadrilateral is a construction which produces a new quadrilateral from a given quadrilateral using the perpendicular bisectors to the sides of the former quadrilateral. This construction arises naturally in an attempt to find a replacement for the circumcenter of a quadrilateral in the case that is non-cyclic.","image":"8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed.svg","url":"Perpendicular_bisector_construction_of_a_quadrilateral"}
