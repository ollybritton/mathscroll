{"title":"Crystallographic restriction theorem","summary":"The crystallographic restriction theorem in its basic form was based on the observation that the rotational symmetries of a crystal are usually limited to 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. However, quasicrystals can occur with other diffraction pattern symmetries, such as 5-fold; these were not discovered until 1982 by Dan Shechtman.[1]","image":"Crystallographic_restriction_polygons.png.webp","url":"Crystallographic_restriction_theorem"}
