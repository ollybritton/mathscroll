{"title":"Riemann sphere","summary":"In mathematics, the Riemann sphere, named after Bernhard Riemann,[1] is a model of the extended complex plane: the complex plane plus one point at infinity. This extended plane represents the extended complex numbers, that is, the complex numbers plus a value ∞ {\\displaystyle \\infty } for infinity. With the Riemann model, the point ∞ {\\displaystyle \\infty } is near to very large numbers, just as the point 0 {\\displaystyle 0} is near to very small numbers.","image":"c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21.svg","url":"Riemann_sphere"}
