{"title":"Uniquely colorable graph","summary":"In graph theory, a uniquely colorable graph is a k-chromatic graph that has only one possible (proper) k-coloring up to permutation of the colors.  Equivalently, there is only one way to partition its vertices into k independent sets and there is no way to partition them into k âˆ’ 1 independent sets.","image":"Generalized_Petersen_9_2_edge_coloring.svg.png.webp","url":"Uniquely_colorable_graph"}
