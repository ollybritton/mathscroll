{"title":"Variance gamma process","summary":"In the theory of stochastic processes, a part of the mathematical theory of probability, the variance gamma process (VG), also known as Laplace motion, is a Lévy process determined by a random time change. The process has finite moments distinguishing it from many Lévy processes.  There is no diffusion component in the VG process and it is thus a pure jump process. The increments are independent and follow a variance-gamma distribution, which is a generalization of the Laplace distribution.","image":"Variance-Gamma-process.png.webp","url":"Variance_gamma_process"}
