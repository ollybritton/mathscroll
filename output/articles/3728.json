{"title":"D'Alembert's principle","summary":"D'Alembert's principle, also known as the Lagrange–d'Alembert principle, is a statement of the fundamental classical laws of motion. It is named after its discoverer, the French physicist and mathematician Jean le Rond d'Alembert. D'Alembert's principle generalizes the principle of virtual work from static to dynamical systems by introducing forces of inertia which, when added to the applied forces in a system, result in dynamic equilibrium.[1][2]","image":"Alembert_d'_–_Traité_de_dynamique%2C_1743_–_BEIC_15685.jpg.webp","url":"D'Alembert's_principle"}
