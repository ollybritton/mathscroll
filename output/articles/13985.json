{"title":"Schur functor","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the field of representation theory, Schur functors (named after Issai Schur) are certain functors from the category of modules over a fixed commutative ring to itself. They generalize the constructions of exterior powers and symmetric powers of a vector space. Schur functors are indexed by Young diagrams in such a way that the horizontal diagram with n cells corresponds to the nth symmetric power functor, and the vertical diagram with n cells corresponds to the nth exterior power functor. If a vector space V is a representation of a group G, then S λ V {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {S} ^{\\lambda }V} also has a natural action of G for any Schur functor S λ ( − ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {S} ^{\\lambda }(-)} .","image":"f2da2a80b2dac026d8ba92874ce1ea199ba74b20.svg","url":"Schur_functor"}
