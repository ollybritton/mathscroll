{"title":"Lions–Lax–Milgram theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Lions–Lax–Milgram theorem (or simply Lions's theorem) is a result in functional analysis with applications in the study of partial differential equations. It is a generalization of the famous Lax–Milgram theorem, which gives conditions under which a bilinear function can be \"inverted\" to show the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to a given boundary value problem. The result is named after the mathematicians Jacques-Louis Lions, Peter Lax and Arthur Milgram.","image":"4f40515f9105e2ceedb24d8adeddd690a9a79601.svg","url":"Lions–Lax–Milgram_theorem"}
