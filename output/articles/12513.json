{"title":"Principal axis theorem","summary":"In geometry and linear algebra, a principal axis is a certain line in a Euclidean space associated with an ellipsoid or hyperboloid, generalizing the major and minor axes of an ellipse or hyperbola. The principal axis theorem states that the principal axes are perpendicular, and gives a constructive procedure for finding them.","image":"bce8d6184812f95c71ba26b5cfac08d1f5c15d94.svg","url":"Principal_axis_theorem"}
