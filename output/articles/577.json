{"title":"Algebraic-group factorisation algorithm","summary":"Algebraic-group factorisation algorithms are algorithms for factoring an integer N by working in an algebraic group defined modulo N whose group structure is the direct sum of the 'reduced groups' obtained by performing the equations defining the group arithmetic modulo the unknown prime factors p1, p2, ...  By the Chinese remainder theorem, arithmetic modulo N corresponds to arithmetic in all the reduced groups simultaneously.","image":"7868d0c96604ff8f0164c3a6a759b1d73d827c58.svg","url":"Algebraic-group_factorisation_algorithm"}
