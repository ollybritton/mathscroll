{"title":"Coincidence","summary":"A coincidence is a remarkable concurrence of events or circumstances that have no apparent causal connection with one another.[1] The perception of remarkable coincidences may lead to supernatural, occult, or paranormal claims, or it may lead to belief in fatalism, which is a doctrine that events will happen in the exact manner of a predetermined plan. In general, the perception of coincidence, for lack of more sophisticated explanations, can serve as a link to folk psychology and philosophy.[2]","image":"Red_cars_parking.jpg.webp","url":"Coincidence"}
