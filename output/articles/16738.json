{"title":"Warburg coefficient","summary":"The Warburg coefficient (or Warburg constant; denoted AW or σ) is the diffusion coefficient of ions in solution, associated to the Warburg element, ZW.  The Warburg coefficient has units of Ω / seconds = Ω ( s − 1 / 2 ) {\\displaystyle {\\Omega }/{\\sqrt {\\text{seconds}}}={\\Omega }(s^{-1/2})}","image":"fbaecfcc81628f7625d87280844ba96f6ae2efd7.svg","url":"Warburg_coefficient"}
