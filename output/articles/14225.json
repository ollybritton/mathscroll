{"title":"Set constraint","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical computer science, a set constraint is an equation or an inequation between sets of terms. Similar to systems of (in)equations between numbers, methods are studied for solving systems of set constraints. Different approaches admit different operators (like \"∪\", \"∩\", \"\\\", and function application)[note 1] on sets and different (in)equation relations (like \"=\", \"⊆\", and \"⊈\") between set expressions.","image":"SetConstraintsAbstractInterpretation_svg.svg.png.webp","url":"Set_constraint"}
