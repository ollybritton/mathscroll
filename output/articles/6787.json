{"title":"Hadwiger conjecture (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, the Hadwiger conjecture states that if G {\\displaystyle G} is loopless and has no K t {\\displaystyle K_{t}} minor then its chromatic number satisfies χ ( G ) < t {\\displaystyle \\chi (G)<t} . It is known to be true for 1 ≤ t ≤ 6 {\\displaystyle 1\\leq t\\leq 6} . The conjecture is a generalization of the four-color theorem and is considered to be one of the most important and challenging open problems in the field.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Hadwiger_conjecture_(graph_theory)"}
