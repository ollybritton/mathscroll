{"title":"Cichoń's diagram","summary":"In set theory, Cichoń's diagram  or Cichon's diagram is a table of 10 infinite cardinal numbers related to the set theory of the reals displaying the provable relations between these cardinal characteristics of the continuum.  All these cardinals are greater than or equal to ℵ 1 {\\displaystyle \\aleph _{1}} , the smallest uncountable cardinal, and they are bounded above by 2 ℵ 0 {\\displaystyle 2^{\\aleph _{0}}} , the cardinality of the continuum.  Four cardinals describe properties of the ideal of sets of measure zero; four more describe the corresponding properties of the ideal of meager sets (first category sets).","image":"78c211ce8badf4ffbf9417ecceb0ef7ab0a8caed.svg","url":"Cichoń's_diagram"}
