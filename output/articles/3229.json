{"title":"Conjugate residual method","summary":"The conjugate residual method is an iterative numeric method used for solving systems of linear equations. It's a Krylov subspace method very similar to the much more popular conjugate gradient method, with similar construction and convergence properties.","image":"c1688bdcfe95659c92f6452378ee805da3f796c8.svg","url":"Conjugate_residual_method"}
