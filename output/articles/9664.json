{"title":"Logarithmic scale","summary":"A logarithmic scale (or log scale) is a way of displaying numerical data over a very wide range of values in a compact way.  As opposed to a linear number line in which every unit of distance corresponds to adding by the same amount, on a logarithmic scale, every unit of length corresponds to multiplying the previous value by the same amount.  Hence, such a scale is nonlinear: the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on, are not equally spaced. Rather, the numbers 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 would be equally spaced. Likewise, the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on, would be equally spaced.  Often exponential growth curves are displayed on a log scale, otherwise they would increase too quickly to fit within a small graph.","image":"Logarithmic_scale.svg.png.webp","url":"Logarithmic_scale"}
