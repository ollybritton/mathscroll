{"title":"Arithmetic group","summary":"In mathematics, an arithmetic group is a group obtained as the integer points of an algebraic group, for example S L 2 ( Z ) . {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {SL} _{2}(\\mathbb {Z} ).} They arise naturally in the study of arithmetic properties of quadratic forms and other classical topics in number theory. They also give rise to very interesting examples of Riemannian manifolds and hence are objects of interest in differential geometry and topology. Finally, these two topics join in the theory of automorphic forms which is fundamental in modern number theory.","image":"d48b870825fbce820cb2938e701c7c04f8bb4e77.svg","url":"Arithmetic_group"}
