{"title":"Hilbert scheme","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics, a Hilbert scheme is a scheme that is the parameter space for the closed subschemes of some projective space (or a more general projective scheme), refining the Chow variety.  The Hilbert scheme is a disjoint union of projective subschemes corresponding to Hilbert polynomials. The basic theory of Hilbert schemes was developed by Alexander GrothendieckÂ (1961). Hironaka's example shows that non-projective varieties need not have Hilbert schemes.","image":"11e2d17ddbe1172aaf44c5d7d30b7bf073d17661.svg","url":"Hilbert_scheme"}
