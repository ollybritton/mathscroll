{"title":"Lonely runner conjecture","summary":"In number theory, specifically the study of Diophantine approximation, the lonely runner conjecture is a conjecture about the long-term behavior of runners on a circular track. It states that n {\\displaystyle n} runners on a track of unit length, with constant speeds all distinct from one another, will each be lonely at some timeâ€”at least 1 / n {\\displaystyle 1/n} units away from all others.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Lonely_runner_conjecture"}
