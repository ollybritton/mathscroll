{"title":"Tetrakis square tiling","summary":"In geometry, the tetrakis square tiling is a tiling of the Euclidean plane. It is a square tiling with each square divided into four isosceles right triangles from the center point, forming an infinite arrangement of lines. It can also be formed by subdividing each square of a grid into two triangles by a diagonal, with the diagonals alternating in direction, or by overlaying two square grids, one rotated by 45 degrees from the other and scaled by a factor of âˆš2.","image":"1-uniform_2_dual.svg.png.webp","url":"Tetrakis_square_tiling"}
