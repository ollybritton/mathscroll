{"title":"Stiff equation","summary":"In mathematics, a stiff equation is a differential equation for which certain numerical methods for solving the equation are numerically unstable, unless the step size is taken to be extremely small. It has proven difficult to formulate a precise definition of stiffness, but the main idea is that the equation includes some terms that can lead to rapid variation in the solution.","image":"StiffEquationNumericalSolvers.svg.png.webp","url":"Stiff_equation"}
