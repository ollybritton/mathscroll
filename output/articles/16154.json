{"title":"Truncated order-4 hexagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the truncated order-4 hexagonal tiling is a uniform tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It has Schl√§fli symbol of t{6,4}. A secondary construction tr{6,6} is called a truncated hexahexagonal tiling with two colors of dodecagons.","image":"H2_tiling_246-3.png.webp","url":"Truncated_order-4_hexagonal_tiling"}
