{"title":"Eilenberg–Mazur swindle","summary":"In mathematics, the Eilenberg–Mazur swindle, named after Samuel Eilenberg and Barry Mazur, is a method of proof  that involves paradoxical properties of  infinite sums. In geometric topology it was introduced by Mazur (1959, 1961) and is often called the Mazur swindle.  In algebra it was introduced by Samuel Eilenberg and is known as the  Eilenberg swindle or Eilenberg telescope (see telescoping sum).","image":"513ed0f6589b16cb08b64cbcc1910cd3ede955c9.svg","url":"Eilenberg–Mazur_swindle"}
