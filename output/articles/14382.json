{"title":"Similarity system of triangles","summary":"A similarity system of triangles is a specific configuration involving a set of triangles.[1] A set of triangles is considered a configuration when all of the triangles share a minimum of one incidence relation with one of the other triangles present in the set.[1] An incidence relation between triangles refers to when two triangles share a point. For example, the two triangles to the right, A H C {\\displaystyle AHC} and B H C {\\displaystyle BHC} , are a configuration made up of two incident relations, since points C {\\displaystyle C} and H {\\displaystyle H} are shared. The triangles that make up configurations are known as component triangles.[1] Triangles must not only be a part of a configuration set to be in a similarity system, but must also be directly similar.[1] Direct similarity implies that all angles are equal between two given triangle and that they share the same rotational sense.[2] As is seen in the adjacent images, in the directly similar triangles, the rotation of B {\\displaystyle B} onto C {\\displaystyle C} and B 1 {\\displaystyle B^{1}} onto C 1 {\\displaystyle C^{1}} occurs in the same direction. In the opposite similar triangles, the rotation of B {\\displaystyle B} onto C {\\displaystyle C} and B 1 {\\displaystyle B^{1}} onto C 1 {\\displaystyle C^{1}} occurs in the opposite direction. In sum, a configuration is a similarity system when all triangles in the set, lie in the same plane and the following holds true: if there are n triangles in the set and n − 1 triangles are directly similar, then n triangles are directly similar.[1]","image":"ae16ac762889ff3721868723e8a37dd10fc6a89f.svg","url":"Similarity_system_of_triangles"}
