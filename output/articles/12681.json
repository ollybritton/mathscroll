{"title":"Proto-value function","summary":"In applied mathematics, proto-value functions (PVFs) are automatically learned basis functions that are useful in approximating task-specific value functions, providing a compact representation of the powers of transition matrices.  They provide a novel framework for solving the credit assignment problem.  The framework introduces a novel approach to solving Markov decision processes (MDP) and reinforcement learning problems, using multiscale spectral and manifold learning methods.  Proto-value functions are generated by spectral analysis of a graph, using the graph Laplacian.","image":"644a8d85ee410b6159ca2bdb5dcb9097e2c8f182.svg","url":"Proto-value_function"}
