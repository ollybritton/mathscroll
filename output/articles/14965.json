{"title":"Statistical manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a statistical manifold is a Riemannian manifold, each of whose points is a probability distribution.  Statistical manifolds provide a setting for the field of information geometry.  The Fisher information metric provides a metric on these manifolds. Following this definition, the log-likelihood function is a differentiable map and the score is an inclusion.[1]","image":"947072b0aebec32885a49c51e2b0eeae8aa12330.svg","url":"Statistical_manifold"}
