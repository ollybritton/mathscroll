{"title":"Goodman and Kruskal's gamma","summary":"In statistics, Goodman and Kruskal's gamma is a measure of rank correlation, i.e., the similarity of the orderings of the data when ranked by each of the quantities. It measures the strength of association of the cross tabulated data when both variables are measured at the ordinal level. It makes no adjustment for either table size or ties. Values range from âˆ’1 (100% negative association, or perfect inversion) to +1 (100% positive association, or perfect agreement). A value of zero indicates the absence of association.","image":"f5b19603a5b698b5d8cb2fbaac684d8eb1c0ef3d.svg","url":"Goodman_and_Kruskal's_gamma"}
