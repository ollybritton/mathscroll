{"title":"Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm","summary":"Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory for finding the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a directed graph. It runs in linear time, matching the time bound for alternative methods including Kosaraju's algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm. The algorithm is named for its inventor, Robert Tarjan.[1]","image":"Tarjan's_Algorithm_Animation.gif","url":"Tarjan's_strongly_connected_components_algorithm"}
