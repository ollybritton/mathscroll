{"title":"Local class field theory","summary":"In mathematics, local class field theory, introduced by Helmut Hasse,[1] is the study of abelian extensions of local fields; here, \"local field\" means a field which is complete with respect to an absolute value or a discrete valuation with a finite residue field: hence every local field is isomorphic (as a topological field) to the real numbers R, the complex numbers C, a finite extension of the p-adic numbers Qp (where p is any prime number), or the field of formal Laurent series Fq((T)) over a finite field Fq.","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Local_class_field_theory"}
