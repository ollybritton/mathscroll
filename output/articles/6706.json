{"title":"Gysin homomorphism","summary":"In the field of mathematics known as algebraic topology, the Gysin sequence is a long exact sequence which relates the cohomology classes of the base space, the fiber and the total space of a sphere bundle.  The Gysin sequence is a useful tool for calculating the cohomology rings given the Euler class of the sphere bundle and vice versa.  It was introduced by GysinÂ (1942), and is generalized by the Serre spectral sequence.","image":"9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a.svg","url":"Gysin_homomorphism"}
