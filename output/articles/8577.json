{"title":"Kaplansky's theorem on projective modules","summary":"In abstract algebra, Kaplansky's theorem on projective modules, first proven by Irving Kaplansky, states that a projective module over a local ring is free;[1] where a not-necessarily-commutative ring is called local if for each element x, either x or 1 âˆ’ x is a unit element.[2] The theorem can also be formulated so to characterize a local ring (#Characterization of a local ring).","image":"ec863025da8f3844272a146530208eb001c3dddb.svg","url":"Kaplansky's_theorem_on_projective_modules"}
