{"title":"Freudenthal suspension theorem","summary":"In mathematics, and specifically in the field of homotopy theory, the Freudenthal suspension theorem is the fundamental result leading to the concept of stabilization of homotopy groups and ultimately to stable homotopy theory.  It explains the behavior of simultaneously taking suspensions and increasing the index of the homotopy groups of the space in question. It was proved in 1937 by Hans Freudenthal.","image":"373a3a4e68803b4eb940b450abb0958c6f9065ae.svg","url":"Freudenthal_suspension_theorem"}
