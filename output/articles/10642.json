{"title":"Monge–Ampère equation","summary":"In mathematics, a (real) Monge–Ampère equation is a nonlinear second-order partial differential equation of special kind. A second-order equation for the unknown function u of two variables x,y is of Monge–Ampère type if it is linear in the determinant of the Hessian matrix of u and in the second-order partial derivatives of u. The independent variables (x,y) vary over a given domain D of R2. The term also applies to analogous equations with n independent variables. The most complete results so far have been obtained when the equation is elliptic.","image":"92752a4d5dfd1fe5c1a55a76dec913638b33c5fa.svg","url":"Monge–Ampère_equation"}
