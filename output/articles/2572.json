{"title":"Chinese hypothesis","summary":"In number theory, the Chinese hypothesis is a disproven conjecture stating that an integer n is prime if and only if it satisfies the condition that 2 n − 2 {\\displaystyle 2^{n}-2} is divisible by n—in other words, that an integer n is prime if and only if 2 n ≡ 2 mod n {\\displaystyle 2^{n}\\equiv 2{\\bmod {n}}} . It is true that if n is prime, then 2 n ≡ 2 mod n {\\displaystyle 2^{n}\\equiv 2{\\bmod {n}}} (this is a special case of Fermat's little theorem), however the converse (if 2 n ≡ 2 mod n {\\displaystyle 2^{n}\\equiv 2{\\bmod {n}}} then n is prime) is false, and therefore the hypothesis as a whole is false. The smallest counterexample is n = 341 = 11×31. Composite numbers n for which 2 n − 2 {\\displaystyle 2^{n}-2} is divisible by n are called Poulet numbers. They are a special class of Fermat pseudoprimes.","image":"8701ed19e403e49799daf0dc76f21fcccfbf8d4f.svg","url":"Chinese_hypothesis"}
