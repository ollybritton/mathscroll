{"title":"Triaugmented dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the triaugmented dodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (J61). It can be seen as a dodecahedron with three pentagonal pyramids (J2) attached to nonadjacent faces. When pyramids are attached to a dodecahedron in other ways, they may result in an augmented dodecahedron (J58), a parabiaugmented dodecahedron (J59), a metabiaugmented dodecahedron (J60), or even a pentakis dodecahedron if the faces are made to be irregular.","image":"Triaugmented_dodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Triaugmented_dodecahedron"}
