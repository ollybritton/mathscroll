{"title":"Point-normal triangle","summary":"The curved point-normal triangle, in short PN triangle, is an interpolation algorithm to retrieve a cubic BÃ©zier triangle from the vertex coordinates of a regular flat triangle and normal vectors. The PN triangle retains the vertices of the flat triangle as well as the corresponding normals. For computer graphics applications, additionally a linear or quadratic interpolant of the normals is created to represent an incorrect but plausible normal when rendering and so giving the impression of smooth transitions between adjacent PN triangles.[1] The usage of the PN triangle enables the visualization of triangle based surfaces in a smoother shape at low cost in terms of rendering complexity and time.","image":"32c292c28d97b7fbba02128f682edbff3d0733de.svg","url":"Point-normal_triangle"}
