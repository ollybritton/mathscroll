{"title":"Isotropic manifold","summary":"In mathematics, an isotropic manifold is a manifold in which the geometry does not depend on directions. Formally, we say that a Riemannian manifold ( M , g ) {\\displaystyle (M,g)} is isotropic if for any point p ∈ M {\\displaystyle p\\in M} and unit vectors v , w ∈ T p M {\\displaystyle v,w\\in T_{p}M} , there is an isometry φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } of M {\\displaystyle M} with φ ( p ) = p {\\displaystyle \\varphi (p)=p} and φ ∗ ( v ) = w {\\displaystyle \\varphi _{\\ast }(v)=w} . Every connected isotropic manifold is homogeneous, i.e. for any p , q ∈ M {\\displaystyle p,q\\in M} there is an isometry φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } of M {\\displaystyle M} with φ ( p ) = q . {\\displaystyle \\varphi (p)=q.} This can be seen by considering a geodesic γ : [ 0 , 2 ] → M {\\displaystyle \\gamma :[0,2]\\to M} from p {\\displaystyle p} to q {\\displaystyle q} and taking the isometry which fixes γ ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (1)} and maps γ ′ ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma '(1)} to − γ ′ ( 1 ) . {\\displaystyle -\\gamma '(1).}","image":"68e27d2e539fd0c3a9a7efab6257abd17de7fc57.svg","url":"Isotropic_manifold"}
