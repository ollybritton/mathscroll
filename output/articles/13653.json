{"title":"Roberts's triangle theorem","summary":"Roberts's triangle theorem, a result in discrete geometry, states that every simple arrangement of n {\\displaystyle n} lines has at least n âˆ’ 2 {\\displaystyle n-2} triangular faces. Thus, three lines form a triangle, four lines form at least two triangles, five lines form at least three triangles, etc. It is named after Samuel Roberts, a British mathematician who published it in 1889.[1][2]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Roberts's_triangle_theorem"}
