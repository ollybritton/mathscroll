{"title":"Covariance and contravariance of vectors","summary":"In physics, especially in multilinear algebra and tensor analysis, covariance and contravariance describe how the quantitative description of certain geometric or physical entities changes with a change of basis. In modern mathematical notation, the role is sometimes swapped.[2]","image":"Vector_1-form.svg.png.webp","url":"Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors"}
