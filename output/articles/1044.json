{"title":"Artinian module","summary":"In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, an Artinian module is a module that satisfies the descending chain condition on its poset of submodules. They are for modules what Artinian rings are for rings, and a ring is Artinian if and only if it is an Artinian module over itself (with left or right multiplication).  Both concepts are named for Emil Artin.","image":"7bdd2bd579c01d4e642792597ed388974b470e0c.svg","url":"Artinian_module"}
