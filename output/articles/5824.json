{"title":"Function space","summary":"In mathematics, a function space is a set of functions between two fixed sets. Often, the domain and/or codomain will have additional structure which is inherited by the function space. For example, the set of functions from any set X into a vector space has a natural vector space structure given by pointwise addition and scalar multiplication. In other scenarios, the function space might inherit a topological or metric structure, hence the name function space.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Function_space"}
