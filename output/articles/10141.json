{"title":"Matrix completion","summary":"Matrix completion is the task of filling in the missing entries of a partially observed matrix, which is equivalent to performing data imputation in statistics. A wide range of datasets are naturally organized in matrix form. One example is the movie-ratings matrix, as appears in the Netflix problem: Given a ratings matrix in which each entry ( i , j ) {\\displaystyle (i,j)} represents the rating of movie j {\\displaystyle j} by customer i {\\displaystyle i} , if customer i {\\displaystyle i} has watched movie j {\\displaystyle j} and is otherwise missing, we would like to predict the remaining entries in order to make good recommendations to customers on what to watch next. Another example is the document-term matrix: The frequencies of words used in a collection of documents can be represented as a matrix, where each entry corresponds to the number of times the associated term appears in the indicated document.","image":"8ef21910f980c6fca2b15bee102a7a0d861ed712.svg","url":"Matrix_completion"}
