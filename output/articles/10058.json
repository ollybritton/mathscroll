{"title":"Mathematical Models (Fischer)","summary":"Mathematical Models: From the Collections of Universities and Museums – Photograph Volume and Commentary is a book on the physical models of concepts in mathematics that were constructed in the 19th century and early 20th century and kept as instructional aids at universities. It credits Gerd Fischer as editor, but its photographs of models are also by Fischer.[1] It was originally published by Vieweg+Teubner Verlag for their bicentennial in 1986, both in German (titled Mathematische Modelle. Aus den Sammlungen von Universitäten und Museen. Mit 132 Fotografien. Bildband und Kommentarband) [2] and (separately) in English translation,[3][4] in each case as a two-volume set with one volume of photographs and a second volume of mathematical commentary.[2][3][4] Springer Spektrum reprinted it in a second edition in 2017, as a single dual-language volume.[1]","image":"Mathematical_Models_(Fischer).jpg.webp","url":"Mathematical_Models_(Fischer)"}
