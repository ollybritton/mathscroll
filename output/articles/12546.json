{"title":"Probability-generating function","summary":"In probability theory, the probability generating function of a discrete random variable is a power series representation (the generating function) of the probability mass function of the random variable.  Probability generating functions are often employed for their succinct description of the sequence of probabilities Pr(X = i) in the probability mass function for a random variable X, and to make available the well-developed theory of power series with non-negative coefficients.","image":"601d281138657d96ff6c5dd0d2295cfda413f5fd.svg","url":"Probability-generating_function"}
