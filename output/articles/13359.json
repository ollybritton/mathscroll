{"title":"Relative cycle","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a relative cycle is a type of algebraic cycle on a scheme. In particular, let X {\\displaystyle X} be a scheme of finite type over a Noetherian scheme S {\\displaystyle S} , so that X → S {\\displaystyle X\\rightarrow S} . Then a relative cycle is a cycle on X {\\displaystyle X} which lies over the generic points of S {\\displaystyle S} , such that the cycle has a well-defined specialization to any fiber of the projection X → S {\\displaystyle X\\rightarrow S} .(Voevodsky & Suslin 2000)","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Relative_cycle"}
