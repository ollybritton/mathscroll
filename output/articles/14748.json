{"title":"Spectral shape analysis","summary":"Spectral shape analysis relies on the spectrum (eigenvalues and/or eigenfunctions) of the Laplace–Beltrami operator to compare and analyze geometric shapes.  Since the spectrum of the Laplace–Beltrami operator is invariant under isometries, it is well suited for the analysis or retrieval of non-rigid shapes, i.e. bendable objects such as humans, animals, plants, etc.","image":"b371f93b8eaf9c6dc97913432902fc93a4b9ee60.svg","url":"Spectral_shape_analysis"}
