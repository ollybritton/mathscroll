{"title":"Functional-theoretic algebra","summary":"Any vector space can be made into a unital associative algebra, called functional-theoretic algebra,  by defining products in terms of two linear functionals. In general, it is a non-commutative algebra. It becomes commutative when the two functionals are the same.","image":"7c66b5836f3b614ae349ed8a024be156ec127569.svg","url":"Functional-theoretic_algebra"}
