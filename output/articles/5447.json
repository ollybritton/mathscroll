{"title":"Finite measure","summary":"In measure theory, a branch of mathematics, a finite measure or totally finite measure[1] is a special measure that always takes on finite values. Among finite measures are probability measures. The finite measures are often easier to handle than more general measures and show a variety of different properties depending on the sets they are defined on.","image":"9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161.svg","url":"Finite_measure"}
