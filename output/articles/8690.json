{"title":"Khinchin's constant","summary":"In number theory, Aleksandr Yakovlevich Khinchin proved that for almost all real numbers x, coefficients ai of the continued fraction expansion of x have a finite geometric mean that is independent of the value of x and is known as Khinchin's constant.","image":"d60c339a507116862b2c43d6d447db411c4277d3.svg","url":"Khinchin's_constant"}
