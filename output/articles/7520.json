{"title":"Hyperfunction","summary":"In mathematics, hyperfunctions are generalizations of functions, as a 'jump' from one holomorphic function to another at a boundary, and can be thought of informally as distributions of infinite order. Hyperfunctions were introduced by Mikio Sato in 1958 in Japanese, (1959, 1960 in English), building upon earlier work by Laurent Schwartz, Grothendieck and others.","image":"e3f3019b383024c33e03b71a287d195f958ca89f.svg","url":"Hyperfunction"}
