{"title":"Bott cannibalistic class","summary":"In mathematics, the Bott cannibalistic class, introduced by Raoul Bott (1962), is an  element θ k ( V ) {\\displaystyle \\theta _{k}(V)} of the representation ring of a compact Lie group that describes the action of the Adams operation ψ k {\\displaystyle \\psi ^{k}} on the Thom class λ V {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{V}} of a complex representation V {\\displaystyle V} . The term \"cannibalistic\" for these classes was introduced by Frank Adams (1965, p.151).","image":"7c41d4aa05d04d8c19f6e95cb5d72513d89c5f2c.svg","url":"Bott_cannibalistic_class"}
