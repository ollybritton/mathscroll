{"title":"Euler's theorem (differential geometry)","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, Euler's theorem is a result on the curvature of curves on a surface.  The theorem establishes the existence of principal curvatures and associated principal directions which give the directions in which the surface curves the most and the least.  The theorem is named for Leonhard Euler who proved the theorem in (Euler 1760).","image":"1da104b6afd01bb21b3297b568707b0fddd53ae0.svg","url":"Euler's_theorem_(differential_geometry)"}
