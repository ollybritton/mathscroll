{"title":"Circular shift","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, a circular shift is the operation of rearranging the entries in a tuple, either by moving the final entry to the first position, while shifting all other entries to the next position, or by performing the inverse operation. A circular shift is a special kind of cyclic permutation, which in turn is a special kind of permutation. Formally, a circular shift is a permutation Ïƒ of the n entries in the tuple such that either","image":"f3d1fbdd6372c22119032adf0398c6c172f8e739.svg","url":"Circular_shift"}
