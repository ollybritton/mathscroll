{"title":"Non-analytic smooth function","summary":"In mathematics, smooth functions (also called infinitely differentiable functions) and analytic functions are two very important types of functions. One can easily prove that any analytic function of a real argument is smooth. The converse is not true, as demonstrated with the counterexample below.","image":"Non-analytic_smooth_function.png.webp","url":"Non-analytic_smooth_function"}
