{"title":"GŒ¥ set","summary":"In the mathematical field of topology, a GŒ¥ set is a subset of a topological space that is a countable intersection of open sets. The notation originated in German with G for Gebiet (German: area, or neighbourhood) meaning open set in this case and Œ¥ for Durchschnitt (German: intersection).[1] Historically GŒ¥ sets were also called inner limiting sets,[2] but that terminology is not in use anymore. GŒ¥ sets, and their dual, Fùúé sets, are the second level of the Borel hierarchy.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"GŒ¥_set"}
