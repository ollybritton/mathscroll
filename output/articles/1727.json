{"title":"Bitruncated tesseractic honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the bitruncated tesseractic honeycomb is a uniform  space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 4-space. It is constructed by a bitruncation of a tesseractic honeycomb. It is also called a cantic quarter tesseractic honeycomb from its q2{4,3,3,4} construction.","image":"CDel_node.png.webp","url":"Bitruncated_tesseractic_honeycomb"}
