{"title":"Shear matrix","summary":"In mathematics (particularly linear algebra), a shear matrix or transvection is an elementary matrix that represents the addition of a multiple of one row or column to another. Such a matrix may be derived by taking the identity matrix and replacing one of the zero elements with a non-zero value.","image":"18878fd3446f64fd21d2c1e38db336e6ef762a1b.svg","url":"Shear_matrix"}
