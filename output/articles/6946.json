{"title":"Hasse–Weil zeta function","summary":"In mathematics, the Hasse–Weil zeta function attached to an algebraic variety V defined over an algebraic number field K is a meromorphic function on the complex plane defined in terms of the number of points on the variety after reducing modulo each prime number p. It is a global L-function defined as an Euler product of local zeta functions.","image":"63d74a2924a7b81b237bb4910ec542f99c9c6622.svg","url":"Hasse–Weil_zeta_function"}
