{"title":"Analytic subgroup theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the analytic subgroup theorem is a significant result in modern transcendental number theory.  It may be seen as a generalisation of Baker's theorem on linear forms in logarithms. Gisbert WÃ¼stholz proved it in the 1980s.[1][2] It marked a breakthrough in the theory of transcendental numbers. Many longstanding open problems can be deduced as direct consequences.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Analytic_subgroup_theorem"}
