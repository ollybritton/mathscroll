{"title":"Holomorphic vector bundle","summary":"In mathematics, a holomorphic vector bundle is a complex vector bundle over a complex manifold X such that the total space E is a complex manifold and the projection map π : E → X is holomorphic. Fundamental examples are the holomorphic tangent bundle of a complex manifold, and its dual, the holomorphic cotangent bundle. A holomorphic line bundle is a rank one holomorphic vector bundle.","image":"c7bc03863390478471f50bd02e045c43ab775fcb.svg","url":"Holomorphic_vector_bundle"}
