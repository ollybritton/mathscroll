{"title":"Dirichlet boundary condition","summary":"In the mathematical study of differential equations, the Dirichlet (or first-type) boundary condition is a type of boundary condition, named after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805â€“1859).[1] When imposed on an ordinary or a partial differential equation, it specifies the values that a solution needs to take along the boundary of the domain.","image":"99c83d6858f3dd68e79a69d036fc0bf68fa22651.svg","url":"Dirichlet_boundary_condition"}
