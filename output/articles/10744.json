{"title":"Moufang loop","summary":"In mathematics, a Moufang loop is  a special kind of algebraic structure. It is similar to a group in many ways but need not be associative. Moufang loops were introduced by Ruth MoufangÂ (1935).  Smooth Moufang loops have an associated algebra, the Malcev algebra, similar in some ways to how a Lie group has an associated Lie algebra.","image":"8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed.svg","url":"Moufang_loop"}
