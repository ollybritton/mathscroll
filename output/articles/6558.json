{"title":"Greedoid","summary":"In combinatorics, a greedoid is a type of set system. It arises from the notion of the matroid, which was originally introduced by Whitney in 1935 to study planar graphs and was later used by Edmonds to characterize a class of optimization problems that can be solved by greedy algorithms. Around 1980, Korte and Lov√°sz introduced the greedoid to further generalize this characterization of greedy algorithms; hence the name greedoid. Besides mathematical optimization, greedoids have also been connected to graph theory, language theory, order theory, and other areas of mathematics.","image":"c8fd0ff93d419ace20674cf42b2bd5f569b391c7.svg","url":"Greedoid"}
