{"title":"Tellegen's theorem","summary":"Tellegen's theorem is one of the most powerful theorems in network theory. Most of the energy distribution theorems and extremum principles in network theory can be derived from it. It was published in 1952 by Bernard Tellegen.[1]   Fundamentally, Tellegen's theorem gives a simple relation between magnitudes that satisfy Kirchhoff's laws of electrical circuit theory.","image":"f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3.svg","url":"Tellegen's_theorem"}
