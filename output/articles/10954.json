{"title":"Natural filtration","summary":"In the theory of stochastic processes in mathematics and statistics, the generated filtration or natural filtration  associated to a stochastic process is a filtration associated to the process which records its \"past behaviour\" at each time. It is in a sense the simplest filtration available for studying the given process: all information concerning the process, and only that information, is available in the natural filtration.","image":"a80636e2d8a9ff9941200bf3831e72133b326c8b.svg","url":"Natural_filtration"}
