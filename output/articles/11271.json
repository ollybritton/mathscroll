{"title":"Null model","summary":"In mathematics, for example in the study of statistical properties of graphs, a null model is a type of random object that matches one specific object in some of its features, or more generally satisfies a collection of constraints, but which is otherwise taken to be an unbiasedly random structure. The null model is used as a term of comparison, to verify whether the object in question displays some non-trivial features (properties that wouldn't be expected on the basis of chance alone or as a consequence of the constraints), such as community structure in graphs. An appropriate null model behaves in accordance with a reasonable null hypothesis for the behavior of the system under investigation.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Null_model"}
