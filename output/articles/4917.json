{"title":"Equilateral pentagon","summary":"In geometry, an equilateral pentagon is a polygon in the Euclidean plane with five sides of equal length. Its five vertex angles can take a range of sets of values, thus permitting it to form a family of pentagons.  In contrast, the regular pentagon is unique, because it is equilateral and moreover it is equiangular (its five angles are equal; the measure is 108 degrees).","image":"Equilateral_pentagon.SVG.png.webp","url":"Equilateral_pentagon"}
