{"title":"Polar set","summary":"In functional and convex analysis, and related disciplines of mathematics, the polar set A ∘ {\\displaystyle A^{\\circ }} is a special convex set associated to any subset A {\\displaystyle A} of a vector space X , {\\displaystyle X,} lying in the dual space X ′ . {\\displaystyle X^{\\prime }.} The bipolar of a subset is the polar of A ∘ , {\\displaystyle A^{\\circ },} but lies in X {\\displaystyle X} (not X ′ ′ {\\displaystyle X^{\\prime \\prime }} ).","image":"3ee7361a1f050d55a3c14f2c8ce53e9a4f5f6fc0.svg","url":"Polar_set"}
