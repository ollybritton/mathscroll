{"title":"Compound of six cubes with rotational freedom","summary":"This uniform polyhedron compound is a symmetric arrangement of 6 cubes, considered as square prisms. It can be constructed by superimposing six identical cubes, and then rotating them in pairs about the three axes that pass through the centres of two opposite cubic faces. Each cube is rotated by an equal (and opposite, within a pair) angle Î¸.","image":"UC07-6_cubes.png.webp","url":"Compound_of_six_cubes_with_rotational_freedom"}
