{"title":"Bézier surface","summary":"Bézier surfaces are a species of mathematical spline used in computer graphics, computer-aided design, and finite element modeling. As with Bézier curves, a Bézier surface is defined by a set of control points. Similar to interpolation in many respects, a key difference is that the surface does not, in general, pass through the central control points; rather, it  is \"stretched\" toward them as though each were an attractive force. They are  visually intuitive, and for many applications, mathematically convenient.","image":"Bézier_surface_example.svg.png.webp","url":"Bézier_surface"}
