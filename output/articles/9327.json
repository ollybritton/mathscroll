{"title":"Lindley's paradox","summary":"Lindley's paradox is a counterintuitive situation in statistics in which the Bayesian and frequentist approaches to a hypothesis testing problem give different results for certain choices of the prior distribution.  The problem of the disagreement between the two approaches was discussed in Harold Jeffreys' 1939 textbook;[1] it became known as  Lindley's paradox after Dennis Lindley called the disagreement a paradox in a 1957 paper.[2]","image":"1bd1c9e87a24e459706fa8e63b9e5d94db4540b4.svg","url":"Lindley's_paradox"}
