{"title":"Gorenstein ring","summary":"In commutative algebra, a Gorenstein local ring is a commutative Noetherian local ring R with finite injective dimension as an R-module. There are many equivalent conditions, some of them listed below, often saying that a Gorenstein ring is self-dual in some sense.","image":"1273e1f00b0143edc49d123fe13ea81d42995ac8.svg","url":"Gorenstein_ring"}
