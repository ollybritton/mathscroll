{"title":"Double tangent bundle","summary":"In mathematics, particularly differential topology, the double tangent bundle or the second tangent bundle refers to the tangent bundle (TTM,πTTM,TM) of the total space TM of the tangent bundle (TM,πTM,M) of a smooth manifold M .[1] A note on notation: in this article, we denote projection maps by their domains, e.g., πTTM : TTM → TM. Some authors index these maps by their ranges instead, so for them, that map would be written πTM.","image":"f62accd94b08c49e612483e7ebcf41f91952e6be.svg","url":"Double_tangent_bundle"}
