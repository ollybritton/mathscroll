{"title":"Correlation function","summary":"A correlation function is a function  that gives the statistical correlation between random variables, contingent on the spatial or temporal distance between those variables. If one considers the correlation function between random variables representing the same quantity measured at two different points, then this is often referred to as an autocorrelation function, which is made up of autocorrelations. Correlation functions of different random variables are sometimes called cross-correlation functions to emphasize that different variables are being considered and because they are made up of cross-correlations.","image":"Comparison_convolution_correlation.svg.png.webp","url":"Correlation_function"}
