{"title":"Diagram (category theory)","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a diagram is the categorical analogue of an indexed family in set theory. The primary difference is that in the categorical setting one has morphisms that also need indexing. An indexed family of sets is a collection of sets, indexed by a fixed set; equivalently, a function from a fixed index set to the class of sets. A diagram is a collection of objects and morphisms, indexed by a fixed category; equivalently, a functor from a fixed index category to some category.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Diagram_(category_theory)"}
