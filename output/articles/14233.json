{"title":"Seven-dimensional space","summary":"In mathematics, a sequence of n real numbers can be understood as a location in n-dimensional space. When n = 7, the set of all such locations is called 7-dimensional space. Often such a space is studied as a vector space, without any notion of distance. Seven-dimensional Euclidean space is seven-dimensional space equipped with a Euclidean metric, which is defined by the dot product.","image":"7-simplex_t0.svg.png.webp","url":"Seven-dimensional_space"}
