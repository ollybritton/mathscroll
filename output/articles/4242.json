{"title":"Discrete Fourier transform","summary":"In mathematics, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) converts a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a function into a same-length sequence of equally-spaced samples of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which is a complex-valued function of frequency. The interval at which the DTFT is sampled is the reciprocal of the duration of the input sequence.  An inverse DFT (IDFT) is a Fourier series, using the DTFT samples as coefficients of complex sinusoids at the corresponding DTFT frequencies.  It has the same sample-values as the original input sequence.  The DFT is therefore said to be a frequency domain representation of the original input sequence.  If the original sequence spans all the non-zero values of a function, its DTFT is continuous (and periodic), and the DFT provides discrete samples of one cycle.  If the original sequence is one cycle of a periodic function, the DFT provides all the non-zero values of one DTFT cycle.","image":"From_Continuous_To_Discrete_Fourier_Transform.gif","url":"Discrete_Fourier_transform"}
