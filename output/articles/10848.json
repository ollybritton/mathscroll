{"title":"Murnaghan–Nakayama rule","summary":"In group theory, a branch of mathematics, the Murnaghan–Nakayama rule, named after Francis Murnaghan and Tadashi Nakayama, is a combinatorial method to compute irreducible character values of a symmetric group.[1] There are several generalizations of this rule beyond the representation theory of symmetric groups, but they are not covered here.","image":"f6029df2f0c3fb61291f9fa07bee165376d4d41c.svg","url":"Murnaghan–Nakayama_rule"}
