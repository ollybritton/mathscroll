{"title":"Miller's recurrence algorithm","summary":"Miller's recurrence algorithm is a procedure for calculating a rapidly decreasing solution of a linear recurrence relation developed by J. C. P. Miller.[1] It was originally developed to compute tables of the modified Bessel function[2] but also applies to Bessel functions of the first kind and has other applications such as computation of the coefficients of  Chebyshev expansions of other special functions.[3]","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Miller's_recurrence_algorithm"}
