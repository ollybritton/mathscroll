{"title":"Schur decomposition","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of linear algebra, the Schur decomposition or Schur triangulation, named after Issai Schur, is a matrix decomposition. It allows one to write an arbitrary complex square matrix as unitarily equivalent to an upper triangular matrix whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of the original matrix.","image":"a55826756ff6249bb9f8c5dd04389d51c42eb45f.svg","url":"Schur_decomposition"}
