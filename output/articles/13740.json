{"title":"Rough path","summary":"In stochastic analysis, a rough path is a generalization of the notion of smooth path allowing to construct a robust solution theory for controlled differential equations driven by classically irregular signals, for example a Wiener process. The theory was developed in the 1990s by Terry Lyons.[1][2][3] Several accounts of the theory are available.[4][5][6][7]","image":"f279a30bc8eabc788f3fe81c9cfb674e72e858db.svg","url":"Rough_path"}
