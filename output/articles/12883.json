{"title":"Quarter 7-cubic honeycomb","summary":"In seven-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the quarter 7-cubic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). It has half the vertices of the 7-demicubic honeycomb, and a quarter of the vertices of a 7-cube honeycomb.[1] Its facets are 7-demicubes, pentellated 7-demicubes, and {31,1,1}Ã—{3,3} duoprisms.","image":"CDel_nodes_10ru.png.webp","url":"Quarter_7-cubic_honeycomb"}
