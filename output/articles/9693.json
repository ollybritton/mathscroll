{"title":"Longest element of a Coxeter group","summary":"In mathematics, the longest element of a Coxeter group is the unique element of maximal length in a finite Coxeter group with respect to the chosen generating set consisting of simple reflections. It is often denoted by w0. See (Humphreys 1992, Section 1.8: Simple transitivity and the longest element, pp. 15–16) and (Davis 2007, Section 4.6, pp. 51–53).","image":"137315d18d5e70159060d1c1007237fc0585f8aa.svg","url":"Longest_element_of_a_Coxeter_group"}
