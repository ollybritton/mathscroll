{"title":"Line bundle","summary":"In mathematics, a line bundle expresses the concept of a line that varies from point to point of a space. For example, a curve in the plane having a tangent line at each point determines a varying line: the tangent bundle is a way of organising these. More formally, in algebraic topology and differential topology, a line bundle is defined as a vector bundle of rank 1.[1]","image":"270db11e509d13d667ca39b4cca410b08deed693.svg","url":"Line_bundle"}
