{"title":"Matroid partitioning","summary":"Matroid partitioning is a problem arising in the mathematical study of matroids and in the design and analysis of algorithms. Its goal is to partition the elements of a matroid into as few independent sets as possible. An example is the problem of computing the arboricity of an undirected graph, the minimum number of forests needed to cover all of its edges. Matroid partitioning may be solved in polynomial time, given an independence oracle for the matroid. It may be generalized to show that a matroid sum is itself a matroid, to provide an algorithm for computing ranks and independent sets in matroid sums, and to compute the largest common independent set in the intersection of two given matroids.[1]","image":"K44_arboricity.svg.png.webp","url":"Matroid_partitioning"}
