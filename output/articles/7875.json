{"title":"Integral graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, an integral graph is a graph whose adjacency matrix's spectrum consists entirely of integers. In other words, a graph is an integral graph if all of the roots of the characteristic polynomial of its adjacency matrix are integers.[1]","image":"66e9abeb5057b7afbf88e3169101849354f13c65.svg","url":"Integral_graph"}
