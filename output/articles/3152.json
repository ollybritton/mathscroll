{"title":"Conditional dependence","summary":"In probability theory, conditional dependence is a relationship between two or more events that are dependent when a third event occurs.[1][2] For example, if A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} are two events that individually increase the probability of a third event C , {\\displaystyle C,} and do not directly affect each other, then initially (when it has not been observed whether or not the event C {\\displaystyle C} occurs)[3][4]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Conditional_dependence"}
