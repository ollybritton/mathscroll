{"title":"Sylvester's law of inertia","summary":"Sylvester's law of inertia is a theorem in matrix algebra about certain properties of the coefficient matrix of a real quadratic form that remain invariant under a change of basis. Namely, if A is the symmetric matrix that defines the quadratic form, and S is any invertible matrix such that D = SAST is diagonal, then the number of negative elements in the diagonal of D is always the same, for all such S; and the same goes for the number of positive elements.","image":"7aaa768f9a80fe069b322df41130e42a6dc843f7.svg","url":"Sylvester's_law_of_inertia"}
