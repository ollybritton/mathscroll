{"title":"Riemann–Hilbert problem","summary":"In mathematics, Riemann–Hilbert problems, named after Bernhard Riemann and David Hilbert, are a class of problems that arise in the study of differential equations in the complex plane. Several existence theorems for Riemann–Hilbert problems have been produced by Mark Krein, Israel Gohberg and others (see the book by Clancey and Gohberg (1981)).","image":"9e1f558f53cda207614abdf90162266c70bc5c1e.svg","url":"Riemann–Hilbert_problem"}
