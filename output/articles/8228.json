{"title":"Janson inequality","summary":"In the mathematical theory of probability, Janson's inequality is a collection of related inequalities giving an exponential bound on the probability of many related events happening simultaneously by their pairwise dependence. Informally Janson's inequality involves taking a sample of many independent random binary variables, and a set of subsets of those variables and bounding the probability that the sample will contain any of those subsets by their pairwise correlation.","image":"4cfde86a3f7ec967af9955d0988592f0693d2b19.svg","url":"Janson_inequality"}
