{"title":"Elliptical distribution","summary":"In probability and statistics, an elliptical distribution is any member of a broad family of probability distributions that generalize the multivariate normal distribution. Intuitively, in the simplified two and three dimensional case, the joint distribution forms an ellipse and an ellipsoid, respectively, in iso-density plots.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Elliptical_distribution"}
