{"title":"Heavy-tailed distribution","summary":"In probability theory, heavy-tailed distributions are probability distributions whose tails are not exponentially bounded:[1] that is, they have heavier tails than the exponential distribution.  In many applications it is the right tail of the distribution that is of interest, but a distribution may have a heavy left tail, or both tails may be heavy.","image":"efca18fefd9c691ede0957ae8bd02a7d930c5b03.svg","url":"Heavy-tailed_distribution"}
