{"title":"Inverse distance weighting","summary":"Inverse distance weighting (IDW) is a type of deterministic method for multivariate interpolation with a known scattered set of points. The assigned values to unknown points are calculated with a weighted average of the values available at the known points. This method can also be used to create spatial weights matrices in spatial autocorrelation analyses (e.g. Moran's I).[1]","image":"c3e6bb763d22c20916ed4f0bb6bd49d7470cffd8.svg","url":"Inverse_distance_weighting"}
