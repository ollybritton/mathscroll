{"title":"Improper integral","summary":"In mathematical analysis, an improper integral is the limit of a definite integral as an endpoint of the interval(s) of integration approaches either a specified real number or positive or negative infinity; or in some instances as both endpoints approach limits. Such an integral is often written symbolically just like a standard definite integral, in some cases with infinity as a limit of integration interval(s).","image":"Improperintegral2.png.webp","url":"Improper_integral"}
