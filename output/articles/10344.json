{"title":"Metagyrate diminished rhombicosidodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the metagyrate diminished rhombicosidodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (J78). It can be constructed as a rhombicosidodecahedron with one pentagonal cupola (J5) rotated through 36 degrees, and a non-opposing pentagonal cupola removed. (The cupolae cannot be adjacent.)","image":"Metagyrate_diminished_rhombicosidodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Metagyrate_diminished_rhombicosidodecahedron"}
