{"title":"Fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory","summary":"In algebra, the fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory describes the effects of changing the ring of K-groups from a ring R to R [ t ] {\\displaystyle R[t]} or R [ t , t âˆ’ 1 ] {\\displaystyle R[t,t^{-1}]} . The theorem was first proved by Hyman Bass for K 0 , K 1 {\\displaystyle K_{0},K_{1}} and was later extended to higher K-groups by Daniel Quillen.","image":"97ef3abdc745032b4d0ff06ee85ee220b1978da7.svg","url":"Fundamental_theorem_of_algebraic_K-theory"}
