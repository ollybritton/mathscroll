{"title":"Singular measure","summary":"In mathematics, two positive (or signed or complex) measures μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } and ν {\\displaystyle \\nu } defined on a measurable space ( Ω , Σ ) {\\displaystyle (\\Omega ,\\Sigma )} are called singular if there exist two disjoint measurable sets A , B ∈ Σ {\\displaystyle A,B\\in \\Sigma } whose union is Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } such that μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } is zero on all measurable subsets of B {\\displaystyle B} while ν {\\displaystyle \\nu } is zero on all measurable subsets of A . {\\displaystyle A.} This is denoted by μ ⊥ ν . {\\displaystyle \\mu \\perp \\nu .}","image":"9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161.svg","url":"Singular_measure"}
