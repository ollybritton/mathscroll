{"title":"Markov logic network","summary":"A Markov logic network (MLN) is a probabilistic logic which applies the ideas of a Markov network to first-order logic, enabling uncertain inference. Markov logic networks generalize first-order logic, in the sense that, in a certain limit, all unsatisfiable statements have a probability of zero, and all tautologies have probability one.","image":"2133a4f7790e55022dcc8e9f889dfffe4b177c5e.svg","url":"Markov_logic_network"}
