{"title":"Normal form for free groups and free product of groups","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in combinatorial group theory, a normal form for a free group over a set of generators or for a free product of groups is a representation of an element by a simpler element, the element being either in the free group or free products of group. In case of free group these simpler elements are reduced words and in the case of free product of groups these are reduced sequences. The precise definitions of these are given below. As it turns out, for a free group and for the free product of groups, there exists a unique normal form i.e each element is representable by a simpler element and this representation is unique. This is the Normal Form Theorem for the free groups and for the free product of groups. The proof here of the Normal Form Theorem follows the idea of Artin and van der Waerden.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Normal_form_for_free_groups_and_free_product_of_groups"}
