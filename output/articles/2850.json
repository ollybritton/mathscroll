{"title":"Cohn-Vossen's inequality","summary":"In differential geometry, Cohn-Vossen's inequality, named after Stefan Cohn-Vossen, relates the integral of Gaussian curvature of a non-compact surface to the Euler characteristic.  It is akin to the Gaussâ€“Bonnet theorem for a compact surface.","image":"bf142f79401ff3c6343b1ebcb74ad55fa08df9bd.svg","url":"Cohn-Vossen's_inequality"}
