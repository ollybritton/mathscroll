{"title":"Equivalence of metrics","summary":"In mathematics, two metrics on the same underlying set are said to be equivalent if the resulting metric spaces share certain properties.  Equivalence is a weaker notion than isometry; equivalent metrics do not have to be literally the same.  Instead, it is one of several ways of generalizing equivalence of norms to general metric spaces.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Equivalence_of_metrics"}
