{"title":"Exhaustion by compact sets","summary":"In mathematics, especially general topology and analysis, an exhaustion by compact sets[1] of a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} is a nested sequence of compact subsets K i {\\displaystyle K_{i}} of X {\\displaystyle X} (i.e. K 1 ⊆ K 2 ⊆ K 3 ⊆ ⋯ {\\displaystyle K_{1}\\subseteq K_{2}\\subseteq K_{3}\\subseteq \\cdots } ), such that K i {\\displaystyle K_{i}} is contained in the interior of K i + 1 {\\displaystyle K_{i+1}} , i.e. K i ⊆ int ( K i + 1 ) {\\displaystyle K_{i}\\subseteq {\\text{int}}(K_{i+1})} for each i {\\displaystyle i} and X = ⋃ i = 1 ∞ K i {\\displaystyle X=\\bigcup _{i=1}^{\\infty }K_{i}} .  A space admitting an exhaustion by compact sets is called exhaustible by compact sets.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Exhaustion_by_compact_sets"}
