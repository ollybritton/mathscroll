{"title":"AC0","summary":"AC0 is a complexity class used in circuit complexity.  It is the smallest class in the AC hierarchy, and consists of all families of circuits of depth O(1) and polynomial size, with unlimited-fanin AND gates and OR gates (we allow NOT gates only at the inputs).[1]  It thus contains NC0, which has only bounded-fanin AND and OR gates.[1]","image":"Diagram_of_an_AC0_Circuit.svg.png.webp","url":"AC0"}
