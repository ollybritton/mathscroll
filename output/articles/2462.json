{"title":"Chaitin's constant","summary":"In the computer science subfield of algorithmic information theory, a Chaitin constant (Chaitin omega number)[1] or halting probability is a real number that, informally speaking, represents the probability that a randomly constructed program will halt. These numbers are formed from a construction due to Gregory Chaitin.","image":"bc95e8dc8c8d25244e5f3ce3d6da59c0da6eb1dd.svg","url":"Chaitin's_constant"}
