{"title":"Ivo Babuška","summary":"Ivo M. Babuška (22 March 1926 – 12 April 2023) was a Czech-American mathematician, noted for his studies of the finite element method and the proof of the Babuška–Lax–Milgram theorem in partial differential equations.[1] One of the celebrated result in the finite elements is the so-called Ladyzenskaja–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) condition (also referred to in some literature as Banach–Nečas–Babuška (BNB)), which provides sufficient conditions for a stable mixed formulation. The LBB condition has guided mathematicians and engineers to develop state-of-the-art formulations for many technologically important problems like Darcy flow, Stokes flow, incompressible Navier–Stokes, nearly incompressible elasticity.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Ivo_Babuška"}
