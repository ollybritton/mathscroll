{"title":"Strict","summary":"In mathematical writing, the term strict refers to the property of excluding equality and equivalence[1] and often occurs in the context of inequality and monotonic functions.[2] It is often attached to a technical term to indicate that the exclusive meaning of the term is to be understood. The opposite is non-strict, which is often understood to be the case but can be put explicitly for clarity. In some contexts, the word \"proper\" can also be used as a mathematical synonym for \"strict\".","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Strict"}
