{"title":"Particular values of the gamma function","summary":"The gamma function is an important special function in mathematics. Its particular values can be expressed in closed form for integer and half-integer arguments, but no simple expressions are known for the values at rational points in general. Other fractional arguments can be approximated through efficient infinite products, infinite series, and recurrence relations.","image":"0b2151987dd2b33625f73cfdf5515d1c58b6a090.svg","url":"Particular_values_of_the_gamma_function"}
