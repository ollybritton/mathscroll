{"title":"Noncommutative algebraic geometry","summary":"Noncommutative algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, and more specifically a direction in noncommutative geometry, that studies the geometric properties of formal duals of non-commutative algebraic objects such as rings as well as geometric objects derived from them (e.g. by gluing along localizations or taking noncommutative stack quotients).","image":"Latex_integers.svg.png.webp","url":"Noncommutative_algebraic_geometry"}
