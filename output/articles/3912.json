{"title":"Dehornoy order","summary":"In the mathematical area of braid theory, the Dehornoy order is a left-invariant total order on the braid group, found by Patrick Dehornoy.[1][2]  Dehornoy's original discovery of the order on the braid group used huge cardinals, but there are now several more elementary constructions of it.[3]","image":"7dd00945aa1aa2ee1c24d8312fa3c5fded9d53c9.svg","url":"Dehornoy_order"}
