{"title":"Cross product","summary":"In mathematics, the cross product or vector product (occasionally directed area product, to emphasize its geometric significance) is a binary operation on two vectors in a three-dimensional oriented  Euclidean vector space (named here E {\\displaystyle E} ), and is denoted by the symbol × {\\displaystyle \\times } . Given two linearly independent vectors a and b, the cross product, a × b (read \"a cross b\"), is a vector that is perpendicular to both a and b,[1] and thus normal to the plane containing them. It has many applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer programming. It should not be confused with the dot product (projection product).","image":"4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b.svg","url":"Cross_product"}
