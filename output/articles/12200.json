{"title":"Plane curve","summary":"In mathematics, a plane curve is a curve in a plane that may be either a Euclidean plane, an affine plane or a projective plane. The most frequently studied cases are smooth plane curves (including piecewise smooth plane curves), and algebraic plane curves. Plane curves also include the Jordan curves (curves that enclose a region of the plane but need not be smooth) and the graphs of continuous functions.","image":"01ede27471a9cc9a0c5eb6e1ebdc7afc8a086543.svg","url":"Plane_curve"}
