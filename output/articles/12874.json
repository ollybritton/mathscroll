{"title":"Quantum phase estimation algorithm","summary":"In quantum computing, the quantum phase estimation algorithm (also referred to as quantum eigenvalue estimation algorithm), is a quantum algorithm to estimate the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator. More precisely, given a unitary matrix U {\\displaystyle U} and a quantum state | ψ ⟩ {\\displaystyle |\\psi \\rangle } such that U | ψ ⟩ = e 2 π i θ | ψ ⟩ {\\displaystyle U|\\psi \\rangle =e^{2\\pi i\\theta }|\\psi \\rangle } , the algorithm estimates the value of θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } with high probability within additive error ε {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon } , using O ( log ⁡ ( 1 / ε ) ) {\\displaystyle O(\\log(1/\\varepsilon ))} qubits (without counting the ones used to encode the eigenvector state) and O ( 1 / ε ) {\\displaystyle O(1/\\varepsilon )} controlled-U operations. The algorithm was initially introduced by Alexei Kitaev in 1995.[1][2]: 246","image":"458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025.svg","url":"Quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm"}
