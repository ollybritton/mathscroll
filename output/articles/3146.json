{"title":"Concyclic points","summary":"In geometry, a set of points are said to be concyclic (or cocyclic) if they lie on a common circle. All concyclic points are at the same distance from the center of the circle. Three points in the plane that do not all fall on a straight line are concyclic, but four or more such points in the plane are not necessarily concyclic.","image":"Concyclic.svg.png.webp","url":"Concyclic_points"}
