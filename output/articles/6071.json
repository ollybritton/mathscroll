{"title":"Generalized estimating equation","summary":"In statistics, a generalized estimating equation (GEE) is used to estimate the parameters of a generalized linear model with a possible unmeasured correlation between observations from different timepoints.[1][2] Although some believe that Generalized estimating equations are robust in everything even with the wrong choice of working-correlation matrix, Generalized estimating equations are only robust to loss of consistency with the wrong choice.","image":"add4abf61bcf5ecb7929088ced5a40c5eab978c1.svg","url":"Generalized_estimating_equation"}
