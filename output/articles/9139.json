{"title":"Lefschetz duality","summary":"In mathematics, Lefschetz duality is a version of Poincaré duality in geometric topology, applying to a manifold with boundary. Such a formulation was introduced by Solomon Lefschetz (1926), at the same time introducing relative homology, for application to the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem.[1] There are now numerous formulations of Lefschetz duality or Poincaré–Lefschetz duality, or Alexander–Lefschetz duality.","image":"7c7b6b02be7b2e3a6c5764f65dac3c9f8ef48b7f.svg","url":"Lefschetz_duality"}
