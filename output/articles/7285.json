{"title":"Histogram","summary":"A histogram is an approximate representation of the distribution of numerical data. The term was first introduced by Karl Pearson.[1]  To construct a histogram, the first step is to \"bin\" (or \"bucket\") the range of values—that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals—and then count how many values fall into each interval.  The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The bins (intervals) must be adjacent and are often (but not required to be) of equal size.[2]","image":"Histogram_of_arrivals_per_minute.svg.png.webp","url":"Histogram"}
