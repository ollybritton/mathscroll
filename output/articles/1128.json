{"title":"Attic numerals","summary":"The Attic numerals are a symbolic number notation used by the ancient Greeks.  They were also known as Herodianic numerals because they were first described in a 2nd-century manuscript by Herodian; or as acrophonic numerals (from acrophony) because the basic symbols derive from the first letters of the (ancient) Greek words that the symbols represented.","image":"EPMA-IGI-3-259-272-Tribute-list-3-crop1-cbadj.png.webp","url":"Attic_numerals"}
