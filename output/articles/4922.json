{"title":"Equioscillation theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the equioscillation theorem concerns the approximation of continuous functions using polynomials when the merit function is the maximum difference (uniform norm). Its discovery is attributed to Chebyshev.[1]","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Equioscillation_theorem"}
