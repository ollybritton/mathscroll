{"title":"Poisson distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.[1] It is named after French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson (/ˈpwɑːsɒn/; French pronunciation: ​[pwasɔ̃]). The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified interval types such as distance, area, or volume.","image":"Poisson_pmf.svg.png.webp","url":"Poisson_distribution"}
