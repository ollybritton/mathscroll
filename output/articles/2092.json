{"title":"Bézout matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a Bézout matrix (or Bézoutian or Bezoutiant) is a special square matrix associated with two polynomials, introduced by James Joseph Sylvester (1853) and Arthur Cayley (1857) and named after Étienne Bézout.  Bézoutian may also refer to the determinant of this matrix, which is equal to the resultant of the two polynomials. Bézout matrices are sometimes used to test the stability of a given polynomial.","image":"d8dd568d570b390c337c0a911f0a1c5c214e8240.svg","url":"Bézout_matrix"}
