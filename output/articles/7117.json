{"title":"Hermitian matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a Hermitian matrix (or self-adjoint matrix) is a complex square matrix that is equal to its own conjugate transposeâ€”that is, the element in the i-th row and j-th column is equal to the complex conjugate of the element in the j-th row and i-th column, for all indices i and j:","image":"e72a9c74052af1c4ed81b610b8cd2da2ad764ffe.svg","url":"Hermitian_matrix"}
