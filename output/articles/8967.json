{"title":"Laguerre transformations","summary":"The Laguerre transformations or axial homographies are an analogue of MÃ¶bius transformations over the dual numbers.[1][2][3][4] When studying these transformations, the dual numbers are often interpreted as representing oriented lines on the plane.[1] The Laguerre transformations map lines to lines, and include in particular all isometries of the plane.","image":"ff0c680f3b080102ea05e16e73b315b6a692c621.svg","url":"Laguerre_transformations"}
