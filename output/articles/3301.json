{"title":"Container method","summary":"The method of (hypergraph) containers is a powerful tool that can help characterize the typical structure and/or answer extremal questions about families of discrete objects with a prescribed set of local constraints. Such questions arise naturally in extremal graph theory, additive combinatorics, discrete geometry, coding theory, and Ramsey theory; they include some of the most classical problems in the associated fields.","image":"662e06a2436f8a44fec791f5c794621f10dc8f30.svg","url":"Container_method"}
