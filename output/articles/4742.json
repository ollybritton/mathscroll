{"title":"Ellipsoidal coordinates","summary":"Ellipsoidal coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system ( λ , μ , ν ) {\\displaystyle (\\lambda ,\\mu ,\\nu )} that generalizes the two-dimensional elliptic coordinate system.  Unlike most three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate systems that feature quadratic coordinate surfaces, the ellipsoidal coordinate system is based on confocal quadrics.","image":"5f59dbb541f8ddddbc4afb943f4ea6cf03a6afc2.svg","url":"Ellipsoidal_coordinates"}
