{"title":"Kolmogorov extension theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Kolmogorov extension theorem (also known as Kolmogorov existence theorem, the Kolmogorov consistency theorem or the Daniell-Kolmogorov theorem) is a theorem that guarantees that a suitably \"consistent\" collection of finite-dimensional distributions will define a stochastic process. It is credited to the English mathematician Percy John Daniell and the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.[1]","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Kolmogorov_extension_theorem"}
