{"title":"Pollard's rho algorithm","summary":"Pollard's rho algorithm is an algorithm for integer factorization. It was invented by John Pollard in 1975.[1] It uses only a small amount of space, and its expected running time is proportional to the square root of the smallest prime factor of the composite number being factorized.","image":"edd7540bf012670052b38c45bf043b5c8e6cd159.svg","url":"Pollard's_rho_algorithm"}
