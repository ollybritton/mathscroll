{"title":"Homological conjectures in commutative algebra","summary":"In mathematics, homological conjectures have been a focus of research activity in commutative algebra since the early 1960s. They concern a number of interrelated (sometimes surprisingly so) conjectures relating various homological properties of a commutative ring to its internal ring structure, particularly its Krull dimension and depth.","image":"98ad34e8dd47b6e45b8106a4812efbccff53ea70.svg","url":"Homological_conjectures_in_commutative_algebra"}
