{"title":"Triple helix","summary":"In the fields of geometry and biochemistry, a triple helix (plural triple helices) is a set of three congruent geometrical helices with the same axis, differing by a translation along the axis. This means that each of the helices keeps the same distance from the central axis. As with a single helix, a triple helix may be characterized by its pitch, diameter, and handedness. Examples of triple helices include triplex DNA,[1] triplex RNA,[2] the collagen helix,[3] and collagen-like proteins.","image":"Collagen_(triple_helix_protein).jpg.webp","url":"Triple_helix"}
