{"title":"Complexification","summary":"In mathematics, the complexification of a vector space V over the field of real numbers (a \"real vector space\") yields a vector space VC over the complex number field, obtained by formally extending the scaling of vectors by real numbers to include their scaling (\"multiplication\") by complex numbers. Any basis for V (a space over the real numbers) may also serve as a basis for VC over the complex numbers.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Complexification"}
