{"title":"Unambiguous Turing machine","summary":"In theoretical computer science, a Turing machine is a theoretical machine that is used in thought experiments to examine the abilities and limitations of computers. An unambiguous Turing machine is a special kind of non-deterministic Turing machine, which, in some sense, is similar to a deterministic Turing machine.","image":"e0659b3aab0be913ad3833068946d9495fd497b0.svg","url":"Unambiguous_Turing_machine"}
