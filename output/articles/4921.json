{"title":"Equinumerosity","summary":"In mathematics, two sets or classes A and B are equinumerous if there exists a one-to-one correspondence (or bijection) between them, that is, if there exists a function from A to B such that for every element y of B, there is exactly one element x of A with f(x) = y.[1] Equinumerous sets are said to have the same cardinality (number of elements).[2] The study of cardinality is often called equinumerosity (equalness-of-number). The terms equipollence (equalness-of-strength) and equipotence (equalness-of-power) are sometimes used instead.","image":"f73b1d3aed1367d41a221dfa66e21dcf3c893f64.svg","url":"Equinumerosity"}
