{"title":"Flat module","summary":"In algebra, a flat module over a ring R is an R-module M such that taking the tensor product over R with M preserves exact sequences. A module is faithfully flat if taking the tensor product with a sequence produces an exact sequence if and only if the original sequence is exact.","image":"2cba88ae5297cbfd075724d2f05e1956bb7ea840.svg","url":"Flat_module"}
