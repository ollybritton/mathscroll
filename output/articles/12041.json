{"title":"Permutohedron","summary":"In mathematics, the permutohedron of order n is an (n − 1)-dimensional polytope embedded in an n-dimensional space. Its vertex coordinates (labels) are the permutations of the first n natural numbers. The edges identify the shortest possible paths (sets of transpositions) that connect two vertices (permutations). Two permutations connected by an edge differ in only two places (one transposition), and the numbers on these places are neighbors (differ in value by 1).","image":"Symmetric_group_4%3B_permutohedron_3D%3B_transpositions_(1-based).png.webp","url":"Permutohedron"}
