{"title":"Newman's lemma","summary":"In mathematics, in the theory of rewriting systems, Newman's lemma, also commonly called the diamond lemma, states that a terminating (or strongly normalizing) abstract rewriting system (ARS), that is, one in which there are no infinite reduction sequences, is confluent if it is locally confluent. In fact a terminating ARS is confluent precisely when it is locally confluent.[1]","image":"Lemme_newman_demonstration.svg.png.webp","url":"Newman's_lemma"}
