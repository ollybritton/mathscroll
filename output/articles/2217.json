{"title":"Carathéodory conjecture","summary":"In differential geometry, the Carathéodory conjecture is a mathematical conjecture attributed to Constantin Carathéodory by Hans Ludwig Hamburger in a session of the Berlin Mathematical Society in 1924.[1] Carathéodory did publish a paper on a related subject,[2] but never committed the conjecture into writing. In,[3] John Edensor Littlewood mentions the conjecture and Hamburger's contribution[4] as an example of a mathematical claim that is easy to state but difficult to prove. Dirk Struik describes in [5] the formal analogy of the conjecture with the Four Vertex Theorem for plane curves. Modern references to the conjecture are the problem list of Shing-Tung Yau,[6] the books of Marcel Berger,[7][8]  as well as the books.[9][10][11][12]","image":"eaedb55ce7584bd0f2e12b5c9ee22f048a3c1ed6.svg","url":"Carathéodory_conjecture"}
