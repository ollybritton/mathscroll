{"title":"Additive combinatorics","summary":"Additive combinatorics is an area of combinatorics in mathematics. One major area of study in additive combinatorics are inverse problems: given the size of the sumset A + B is small, what can we say about the structures of A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} ? In the case of the integers, the classical Freiman's theorem provides a partial answer to this question in terms of multi-dimensional arithmetic progressions.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Additive_combinatorics"}
