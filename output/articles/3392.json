{"title":"Convex optimization","summary":"Convex optimization is a subfield of mathematical optimization that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets (or, equivalently, maximizing concave functions over convex sets).  Many classes of convex optimization problems admit polynomial-time algorithms,[1] whereas mathematical optimization is in general NP-hard.[2][3][4]","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Convex_optimization"}
