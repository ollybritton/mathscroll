{"title":"Continuous q-Laguerre polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the continuous q-Laguerre polynomials  are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme. Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties.","image":"c96e5a4880770a6e6fb318d1965b8f14a70da6f7.svg","url":"Continuous_q-Laguerre_polynomials"}
