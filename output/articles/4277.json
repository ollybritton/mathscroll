{"title":"Disjoint union","summary":"In mathematics, a disjoint union (or discriminated union) of a family of sets ( A i : i ∈ I ) {\\displaystyle (A_{i}:i\\in I)} is a set A , {\\displaystyle A,} often denoted by ⨆ i ∈ I A i , {\\textstyle \\bigsqcup _{i\\in I}A_{i},} with an injection of each A i {\\displaystyle A_{i}} into A , {\\displaystyle A,} such that the images of these injections form a partition of A {\\displaystyle A} (that is, each element of A {\\displaystyle A} belongs to exactly one of these images). A disjoint union of a family of pairwise disjoint sets is their union.","image":"acc304dbda701fb57315e5dfa334a0e0d3e63299.svg","url":"Disjoint_union"}
