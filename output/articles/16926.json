{"title":"Wild number","summary":"Originally, wild numbers are the numbers supposed to belong to a fictional sequence of numbers  imagined to exist in the mathematical world of the mathematical fiction The Wild Numbers authored by Philibert Schogt, a Dutch philosopher and mathematician.[1] Even though Schogt has given a definition of the wild number sequence in his novel, it is couched in a deliberately imprecise language that the definition turns out to be no definition at all. However, the author claims that the first few members of the sequence are 11, 67, 2, 4769, 67. Later, inspired by this wild and erratic behaviour of the fictional wild numbers, American mathematician J. C. Lagarias used the terminology to describe a precisely defined sequence of integers which shows somewhat similar wild and erratic behaviour. Lagaria's wild numbers are connected with the Collatz conjecture and the concept of the 3x + 1 semigroup.[2][3]  The original fictional sequence of wild numbers has found a place in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.[4]","image":"84977a462a96bb639a5ee0696edfac3791dafe71.svg","url":"Wild_number"}
