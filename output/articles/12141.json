{"title":"Picard–Lindelöf theorem","summary":"In mathematics, specifically the study of differential equations, the Picard–Lindelöf theorem gives a set of conditions under which an initial value problem has a unique solution. It is also known as Picard's existence theorem, the Cauchy–Lipschitz theorem, or the existence and uniqueness theorem.","image":"8365f9ba1c5a6b7a8f673e5924bc6a0519a3679d.svg","url":"Picard–Lindelöf_theorem"}
