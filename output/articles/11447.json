{"title":"Opposite ring","summary":"In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, the opposite of a ring is another ring with the same elements and addition operation, but with the multiplication performed in the reverse order. More explicitly, the opposite of a ring (R, +, ⋅) is the ring (R, +, ∗) whose multiplication ∗ is defined by a ∗ b = b ⋅ a for all a, b in R.[1][2] The opposite ring can be used to define multimodules, a generalization of bimodules. They also help clarify the relationship between left and right modules (see § Properties).","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Opposite_ring"}
