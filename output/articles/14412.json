{"title":"Simplicial complex recognition problem","summary":"The simplicial complex recognition problem is a computational problem in algebraic topology. Given a simplicial complex, the problem is to decide whether it is homeomorphic to another fixed simplicial complex. The problem is undecidable for complexes of dimension 5 or more.[1][2]: 9–11","image":"01e57c690f890937838c10ba57853ff21bf30ec8.svg","url":"Simplicial_complex_recognition_problem"}
