{"title":"Parseval's identity","summary":"In mathematical analysis, Parseval's identity, named after Marc-Antoine Parseval, is a fundamental result on the summability of the Fourier series of a function.  Geometrically, it is a generalized Pythagorean theorem for inner-product spaces (which can have an uncountable infinity of basis vectors).","image":"9f574d00b5a2ed6c6d634a4c924fff684f6ab199.svg","url":"Parseval's_identity"}
