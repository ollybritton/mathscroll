{"title":"Fermat point","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, the Fermat point of a triangle, also called the Torricelli point or Fermatâ€“Torricelli point, is a point such that the sum of the three distances from each of the three vertices of the triangle to the point is the smallest possible[1] or, equivalently, the geometric median of the three vertices. It is so named because this problem was first raised by Fermat in a private letter to Evangelista Torricelli, who solved it.","image":"Fermat_Point.svg.png.webp","url":"Fermat_point"}
