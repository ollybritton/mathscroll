{"title":"Limiting amplitude principle","summary":"In mathematics, the limiting amplitude principle is a concept from operator theory and scattering theory used for choosing a particular solution to the Helmholtz equation. The choice is made by considering a particular time-dependent problem of the forced oscillations due to the action of a periodic force. The principle was introduced by Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov and Alexander Andreevich Samarskii.[1] It is closely related to the limiting absorption principle (1905) and the Sommerfeld radiation condition (1912). The terminology -- both the limiting absorption principle and the limiting amplitude principle -- was introduced by Aleksei Sveshnikov.[2]","image":"e6d310e77fab587784633b907f68e9cb24856490.svg","url":"Limiting_amplitude_principle"}
