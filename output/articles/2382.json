{"title":"Causal loop diagram","summary":"A causal loop diagram (CLD) is a causal diagram that aids in visualizing how different variables in a system are causally interrelated. The diagram consists of a set of words and arrows. Causal loop diagrams are accompanied by a narrative which describes the causally closed situation the CLD describes. Closed loops, or causal feedback loops, in the diagram are very important features of CLDs.","image":"CLD_positive_ANI.gif","url":"Causal_loop_diagram"}
