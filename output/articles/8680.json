{"title":"Kervaire manifold","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in differential topology, a Kervaire manifold K 4 n + 2 {\\displaystyle K^{4n+2}} is a piecewise-linear manifold of dimension 4 n + 2 {\\displaystyle 4n+2} constructed by Michel KervaireÂ (1960) by plumbing together the tangent bundles of two ( 2 n + 1 ) {\\displaystyle (2n+1)} -spheres, and then gluing a ball to the result. In 10 dimensions this gives a piecewise-linear manifold with no smooth structure.","image":"55d42e53a9e2184a9aa4d0ce1d37a9e0fe00afb4.svg","url":"Kervaire_manifold"}
