{"title":"Weierstrass point","summary":"In mathematics, a Weierstrass point P {\\displaystyle P} on a nonsingular algebraic curve C {\\displaystyle C} defined over the complex numbers is a point such that there are more functions on C {\\displaystyle C} , with their poles restricted to P {\\displaystyle P} only, than would be predicted by the Riemannâ€“Roch theorem.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Weierstrass_point"}
