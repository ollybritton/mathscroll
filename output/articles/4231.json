{"title":"Disc integration","summary":"Disc integration, also known in integral calculus as the disc method, is a method for calculating the volume of a solid of revolution of a solid-state material when integrating along an axis \"parallel\" to the axis of revolution. This method models the resulting three-dimensional shape as a stack of an infinite number of discs of varying radius and infinitesimal thickness. It is also possible to use the same principles with rings instead of discs (the \"washer method\") to obtain hollow solids of revolutions. This is in contrast to shell integration, which integrates along an axis perpendicular to the axis of revolution.","image":"Disc_integration.svg.png.webp","url":"Disc_integration"}
