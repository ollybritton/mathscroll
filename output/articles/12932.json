{"title":"Quasimorphism","summary":"In mathematics, given a group G {\\displaystyle G} , a quasimorphism (or quasi-morphism) is a function f : G → R {\\displaystyle f:G\\to \\mathbb {R} } which is additive up to bounded error, i.e. there exists a constant D ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle D\\geq 0} such that | f ( g h ) − f ( g ) − f ( h ) | ≤ D {\\displaystyle |f(gh)-f(g)-f(h)|\\leq D} for all g , h ∈ G {\\displaystyle g,h\\in G} . The least positive value of D {\\displaystyle D} for which this inequality is satisfied is called the defect of f {\\displaystyle f} , written as D ( f ) {\\displaystyle D(f)} . For a group G {\\displaystyle G} , quasimorphisms form a subspace of the function space R G {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{G}} .","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Quasimorphism"}
