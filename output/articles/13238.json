{"title":"Recursion","summary":"Recursion occurs when the definition of a concept or process depends on a simpler version of itself.[1] Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no infinite loop or infinite chain of references (\"crock recursion\") can occur.","image":"Droste_Cacao_Alcalinise_blikje%2C_foto4.JPG.webp","url":"Recursion"}
