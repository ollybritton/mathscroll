{"title":"Torsion tensor","summary":"In differential geometry, the notion of torsion is a manner of characterizing a twist or screw of a moving frame around a curve.  The torsion of a curve, as it appears in the Frenet–Serret formulas, for instance, quantifies the twist of a curve about its tangent vector as the curve evolves (or rather the rotation of the Frenet–Serret frame about the tangent vector). In the geometry of surfaces, the  geodesic torsion describes how a surface twists about a curve on the surface. The companion notion of  curvature measures how moving frames \"roll\" along a curve \"without twisting\".","image":"Torsion_along_a_geodesic.svg.png.webp","url":"Torsion_tensor"}
