{"title":"Quotient stack","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a quotient stack is a stack that parametrizes equivariant objects. Geometrically, it generalizes a quotient of a scheme or a variety by a group: a quotient variety, say, would be a coarse approximation of a quotient stack.","image":"6c10708eac95ed8fcce0dd132f18c6d844536ebf.svg","url":"Quotient_stack"}
