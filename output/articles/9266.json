{"title":"Lie algebroid","summary":"In mathematics, a Lie algebroid is a vector bundle A → M {\\displaystyle A\\rightarrow M} together with a Lie bracket on its space of sections Γ ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\Gamma (A)} and a vector bundle morphism ρ : A → T M {\\displaystyle \\rho :A\\rightarrow TM} , satisfying a Leibniz rule. A Lie algebroid can thus be thought of as a \"many-object generalisation\" of a Lie algebra.","image":"01b0effa0892bfad961d5890bc5067a13c324269.svg","url":"Lie_algebroid"}
