{"title":"Piecewise","summary":"In mathematics, a piecewise-defined function (also called a piecewise function, a hybrid function, or definition by cases) is a function defined by multiple sub-functions, where each sub-function applies to a different interval in the domain.[1][2][3] Piecewise definition is actually a way of expressing the function, rather than a characteristic of the function itself.","image":"Piecewise_linear_function_gnuplot.svg.png.webp","url":"Piecewise"}
