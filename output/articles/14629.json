{"title":"Sobolev inequality","summary":"In mathematics, there is in mathematical analysis a class of Sobolev inequalities, relating norms including those of Sobolev spaces. These are used to prove the Sobolev embedding theorem, giving inclusions between certain Sobolev spaces, and the Rellichâ€“Kondrachov theorem showing that under slightly stronger conditions some Sobolev spaces are compactly embedded in others. They are named after Sergei Lvovich Sobolev.","image":"Sobolev_embedding_theorem.svg.png.webp","url":"Sobolev_inequality"}
