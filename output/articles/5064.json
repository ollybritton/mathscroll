{"title":"Euler's sum of powers conjecture","summary":"Euler's conjecture is a disproved conjecture in mathematics related to Fermat's Last Theorem.  It was proposed by Leonhard Euler in 1769. It states that for all integers n and k greater than 1, if the sum of n many kth powers of positive integers is itself a kth power, then n is greater than or equal to k:","image":"ee031320f441e183ad7bb67e87ddb20a0e13f5d4.svg","url":"Euler's_sum_of_powers_conjecture"}
