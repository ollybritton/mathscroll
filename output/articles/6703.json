{"title":"Gyroelongated triangular cupola","summary":"In geometry, the gyroelongated triangular cupola is one of the Johnson solids  (J22). It can be constructed by attaching a hexagonal antiprism to the base of a triangular cupola (J3).  This is called \"gyroelongation\", which means that an antiprism is joined to the base of a solid, or between the bases of more than one solid.","image":"Gyroelongated_triangular_cupola.png.webp","url":"Gyroelongated_triangular_cupola"}
