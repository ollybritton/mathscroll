{"title":"Bilinear form","summary":"In mathematics, a bilinear form is a bilinear map V × V → K on a vector space V (the elements of which are called vectors) over a field K (the elements of which are called scalars). In other words, a bilinear form is a function B : V × V → K that is linear in each argument separately:","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Bilinear_form"}
