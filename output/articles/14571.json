{"title":"Smash product","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, the smash product of two pointed spaces (i.e. topological spaces with distinguished basepoints) (X, x0) and (Y, y0) is the quotient of the product space X × Y under the identifications (x, y0) ∼ (x0, y) for all x in X and y in Y.  The smash product is itself a pointed space, with basepoint being the equivalence class of  (x0, y0). The smash product is usually denoted X ∧ Y or X ⨳ Y. The smash product depends on the choice of basepoints (unless both X and Y are homogeneous).","image":"7288c1134e4428b063defc6653e788e5700e049c.svg","url":"Smash_product"}
