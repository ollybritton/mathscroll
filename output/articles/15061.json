{"title":"Stiefel–Whitney class","summary":"In mathematics, in particular in algebraic topology and differential geometry, the Stiefel–Whitney classes are a set of topological invariants of a real vector bundle that describe the obstructions to constructing everywhere independent sets of sections of the vector bundle. Stiefel–Whitney classes are indexed from 0 to n, where n is the rank of the vector bundle. If the Stiefel–Whitney class of index i is nonzero, then there cannot exist ( n − i + 1 ) {\\displaystyle (n-i+1)} everywhere linearly independent sections of the vector bundle. A nonzero nth Stiefel–Whitney class indicates that every section of the bundle must vanish at some point.  A nonzero first Stiefel–Whitney class indicates that the vector bundle is not orientable.  For example, the first Stiefel–Whitney class of the Möbius strip, as a line bundle over the circle, is not zero, whereas the first Stiefel–Whitney class of the trivial line bundle over the circle, S 1 × R {\\displaystyle S^{1}\\times \\mathbb {R} } , is zero.","image":"b2426ea3e14ddf54b0f528bb480b8b5b775c1a9b.svg","url":"Stiefel–Whitney_class"}
