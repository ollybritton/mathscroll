{"title":"Square wave","summary":"A square wave is  a non-sinusoidal periodic waveform in which the amplitude alternates at a steady frequency between fixed minimum and maximum values, with the same duration at minimum and maximum. In an ideal square wave, the transitions between minimum and maximum are instantaneous.","image":"Waveforms.svg.png.webp","url":"Square_wave"}
