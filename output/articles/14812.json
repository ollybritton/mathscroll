{"title":"Spinor","summary":"In geometry and physics, spinors /spɪnər/ are elements of a complex vector space that can be associated with Euclidean space.[lower-alpha 2] Like geometric vectors and more general tensors, spinors transform linearly when the Euclidean space is subjected to a  slight (infinitesimal) rotation.[lower-alpha 3] Unlike vectors and tensors,  a spinor transforms to its negative when the space is continuously rotated through a complete turn from 0° to 360° (see picture). This property characterizes spinors: spinors can be viewed as the \"square roots\" of vectors (although this is inaccurate and may be misleading; they are better viewed as \"square roots\" of sections of vector bundles – in the case of the exterior algebra bundle of the cotangent bundle, they thus become \"square roots\" of differential forms).","image":"Spinor_on_the_circle.png.webp","url":"Spinor"}
