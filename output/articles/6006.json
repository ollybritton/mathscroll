{"title":"Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula","summary":"The Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula is an adaptive method for numerical integration. It is a variant of Gaussian quadrature, in which the evaluation points are chosen so that an accurate approximation can be computed by re-using the information produced by the computation of a less accurate approximation. It is an example of what is called a nested quadrature rule: for the same set of function evaluation points, it has two quadrature rules, one higher order and one lower order (the latter called an embedded rule). The difference between these two approximations is used to estimate the calculational error of the integration.","image":"249ee3fdbced31dfc328ff357f67bb134ca66b8d.svg","url":"Gauss–Kronrod_quadrature_formula"}
