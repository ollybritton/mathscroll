{"title":"Lossless compression","summary":"Lossless compression is a class of data compression that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data with no loss of information. Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical redundancy.[1]  By contrast, lossy compression permits reconstruction only of an approximation of the original data, though usually with greatly improved compression rates (and therefore reduced media sizes).","image":"7f6b53682fddbe3028ffd75bd75771b86c6c7bd9.svg","url":"Lossless_compression"}
