{"title":"Isoparametric manifold","summary":"In Riemannian geometry, an isoparametric manifold is a type of (immersed) submanifold of Euclidean space whose normal bundle is flat and whose principal curvatures are constant along any parallel normal vector field.  The set of isoparametric manifolds is stable under the mean curvature flow.","image":"7389df45a2703aa32b640899e947cb56ae659c90.svg","url":"Isoparametric_manifold"}
