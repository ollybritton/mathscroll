{"title":"Priestley space","summary":"In mathematics, a Priestley space is an ordered topological space with special properties. Priestley spaces are named after Hilary Priestley who introduced and investigated them.[1] Priestley spaces play a fundamental role in the study of distributive lattices. In particular, there is a duality (\"Priestley duality\"[2]) between the category of Priestley spaces and the category of bounded distributive lattices.[3][4]","image":"ea530efb25f2074f598d51767b79b208054254f7.svg","url":"Priestley_space"}
