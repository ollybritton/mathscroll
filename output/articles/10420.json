{"title":"Michaelis–Menten–Monod kinetics","summary":"For Michaelis–Menten–Monod (MMM) kinetics it is intended the coupling of an enzyme-driven chemical reaction of the Michaelis–Menten type[1] with the Monod growth of an organisms that performs the chemical reaction.[2] The enzyme-driven reaction can be conceptualized as the binding of an enzyme E with the substrate S to form an intermediate complex C, which releases the reaction product P and the unchanged enzyme E. During the metabolic consumption of S, biomass B is produced, which synthesizes the enzyme, thus feeding back to the chemical reaction. The two processes can be expressed as","image":"2915dc6f80503d5f11d973be797e409c0995bde5.svg","url":"Michaelis–Menten–Monod_kinetics"}
