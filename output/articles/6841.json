{"title":"Hamiltonian mechanics","summary":"Hamiltonian mechanics emerged in 1833 as a reformulation of Lagrangian mechanics. Introduced by Sir William Rowan Hamilton,[1] Hamiltonian mechanics replaces (generalized) velocities q Ë™ i {\\displaystyle {\\dot {q}}^{i}} used in Lagrangian mechanics with (generalized) momenta. Both theories provide interpretations of classical mechanics and describe the same physical phenomena.","image":"a27052baf4d640bd44a642d1f450ea3819a2b4ff.svg","url":"Hamiltonian_mechanics"}
