{"title":"Laurent series","summary":"In mathematics, the Laurent series of a complex function f ( z ) {\\displaystyle f(z)} is a representation of that function as a power series which includes terms of negative degree. It may be used to express complex functions in cases where a Taylor series expansion cannot be applied. The Laurent series was named after and first published by Pierre Alphonse Laurent in 1843.  Karl Weierstrass may have discovered it first in a paper written in 1841, but it was not published until after his death.[1]","image":"d8dd568d570b390c337c0a911f0a1c5c214e8240.svg","url":"Laurent_series"}
