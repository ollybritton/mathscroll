{"title":"Hurewicz space","summary":"In mathematics, a Hurewicz space is a topological space that satisfies a certain basic selection principle that generalizes σ-compactness. A Hurewicz space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers U 1 , U 2 , … {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {U}}_{1},{\\mathcal {U}}_{2},\\ldots } of the space there are finite sets F 1 ⊂ U 1 , F 2 ⊂ U 2 , … {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}_{1}\\subset {\\mathcal {U}}_{1},{\\mathcal {F}}_{2}\\subset {\\mathcal {U}}_{2},\\ldots } such that every point of the space belongs to all but finitely many sets ⋃ F 1 , ⋃ F 2 , … {\\displaystyle \\bigcup {\\mathcal {F}}_{1},\\bigcup {\\mathcal {F}}_{2},\\ldots } .","image":"65ddf597330a38fd737d609d0549d4e8de1ade13.svg","url":"Hurewicz_space"}
