{"title":"Continuous stochastic process","summary":"In probability theory, a continuous stochastic process is a type of stochastic process that may be said to be \"continuous\" as a function of its \"time\" or index parameter. Continuity is a nice property for (the sample paths of) a process to have, since it implies that they are well-behaved in some sense, and, therefore, much easier to analyze. It is implicit here that the index of the stochastic process is a continuous variable. Some authors[1] define a \"continuous (stochastic) process\" as only requiring that the index variable be continuous, without continuity of sample paths: in some terminology, this would be a continuous-time stochastic process, in parallel to a \"discrete-time process\". Given the possible confusion, caution is needed.[1]","image":"a54b9d53fad072903d677ff0a858b58f4a7b00e4.svg","url":"Continuous_stochastic_process"}
