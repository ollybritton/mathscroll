{"title":"Hyperinteger","summary":"In nonstandard analysis, a hyperinteger n is a hyperreal number that is equal to its own integer part.  A hyperinteger may be either finite or infinite.  A finite hyperinteger is an ordinary integer.  An example of an infinite hyperinteger is given by the class of the sequence (1, 2, 3, ...) in the ultrapower construction of the hyperreals.","image":"738c94c88678dd08a289f90a47a609ce44eedf14.svg","url":"Hyperinteger"}
