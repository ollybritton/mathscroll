{"title":"Finite morphism","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a finite morphism between two affine varieties X , Y {\\displaystyle X,Y} is a dense regular map which induces isomorphic inclusion k [ Y ] ↪ k [ X ] {\\displaystyle k\\left[Y\\right]\\hookrightarrow k\\left[X\\right]} between their coordinate rings, such that k [ X ] {\\displaystyle k\\left[X\\right]} is integral over k [ Y ] {\\displaystyle k\\left[Y\\right]} .[1] This definition can be extended to the quasi-projective varieties, such that a regular map f : X → Y {\\displaystyle f\\colon X\\to Y} between quasiprojective varieties is finite if any point like y ∈ Y {\\displaystyle y\\in Y} has an affine neighbourhood V such that U = f − 1 ( V ) {\\displaystyle U=f^{-1}(V)} is affine and f : U → V {\\displaystyle f\\colon U\\to V} is a finite map (in view of the previous definition, because it is between affine varieties).[2]","image":"b8705438171d938b7f59cd1bfa5b7d99b6afa5cd.svg","url":"Finite_morphism"}
