{"title":"Merton's portfolio problem","summary":"Merton's portfolio problem is a well known problem in continuous-time finance and in particular intertemporal portfolio choice.  An investor must choose how much to consume and must allocate their wealth between stocks and a risk-free asset so as to maximize expected utility.  The problem was formulated and solved by Robert C. Merton in 1969 both for finite lifetimes and for the infinite case.[1][2] Research has continued to extend and generalize the model to include factors like transaction costs and bankruptcy.","image":"ec33d67ca629375cabc24ffd92636a86104bd5ee.svg","url":"Merton's_portfolio_problem"}
