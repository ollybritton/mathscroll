{"title":"Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane","summary":"In hyperbolic geometry, a uniform hyperbolic tiling (or regular, quasiregular or semiregular hyperbolic tiling) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane which has regular polygons as faces and is vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices, isogonal, i.e. there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other). It follows that all vertices are congruent, and the tiling has a high degree of rotational and translational symmetry.","image":"Uniform_tiling_532-t0.png.webp","url":"Uniform_tilings_in_hyperbolic_plane"}
