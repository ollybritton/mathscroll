{"title":"Distance-transitive graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a distance-transitive graph is a graph such that, given any two vertices v and w at any distance i, and any other two vertices x and y at the same distance, there is an automorphism of the graph that carries v to x and w toÂ y. Distance-transitive graphs were first defined in 1971 by Norman L. Biggs and D. H. Smith.","image":"BiggsSmith.svg.png.webp","url":"Distance-transitive_graph"}
