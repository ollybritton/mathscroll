{"title":"Conditional probability distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, given two jointly distributed random variables X {\\displaystyle X} and Y {\\displaystyle Y} , the conditional probability distribution of Y {\\displaystyle Y} given X {\\displaystyle X} is the probability distribution of Y {\\displaystyle Y} when X {\\displaystyle X} is known to be a particular value; in some cases the conditional probabilities may be expressed as functions containing the unspecified value x {\\displaystyle x} of X {\\displaystyle X} as a parameter. When both X {\\displaystyle X} and Y {\\displaystyle Y} are categorical variables, a conditional probability table is typically used to represent the conditional probability. The conditional distribution contrasts with the marginal distribution of a random variable, which is its distribution without reference to the value of the other variable.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Conditional_probability_distribution"}
