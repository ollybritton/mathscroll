{"title":"Necklace (combinatorics)","summary":"In combinatorics, a k-ary necklace of length n is an equivalence class of n-character strings over an alphabet of size k, taking all rotations as equivalent. It represents a structure with n circularly connected beads which have k available colors.","image":"Bracelets33.svg.png.webp","url":"Necklace_(combinatorics)"}
