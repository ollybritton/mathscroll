{"title":"Lagrange's identity (boundary value problem)","summary":"In the study of ordinary differential equations and their associated boundary value problems, Lagrange's identity, named after Joseph Louis Lagrange, gives the boundary terms arising from integration by parts of a self-adjoint linear differential operator.  Lagrange's identity is fundamental in Sturmâ€“Liouville theory.  In more than one independent variable, Lagrange's identity is generalized by Green's second identity.","image":"fd3f05a51e4bc3c83b1eda9a164f416e631e88c8.svg","url":"Lagrange's_identity_(boundary_value_problem)"}
