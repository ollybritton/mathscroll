{"title":"Amicable numbers","summary":"Amicable numbers are two different natural numbers related in such a way that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. That is, s(a)=b and s(b)=a, where s(n)=Ïƒ(n)-n is equal to the sum of positive divisors of n except n itself (see also divisor function).","image":"Amicable_numbers_rods_220_and_284.png.webp","url":"Amicable_numbers"}
