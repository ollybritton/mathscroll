{"title":"Conformal geometric algebra","summary":"Conformal geometric algebra (CGA) is the geometric algebra constructed over the resultant space of a map from points in an n-dimensional base space Rp,q to null vectors in Rp+1,q+1.  This allows operations on the base space, including reflections, rotations and translations to be represented using versors of the geometric algebra; and it is found that points, lines, planes, circles and spheres gain particularly natural and computationally amenable representations.","image":"46fb766be02e123a8418f7bd3356494c5d45eb4d.svg","url":"Conformal_geometric_algebra"}
