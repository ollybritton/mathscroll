{"title":"Measurable acting group","summary":"In mathematics, a measurable acting group is a special group that acts on some space in a way that is compatible with structures of measure theory. Measurable acting groups are found in the intersection of measure theory and group theory, two sub-disciplines of mathematics. Measurable acting groups are the basis for the study of invariant measures in abstract settings, most famously the Haar measure, and the study of stationary random measures.","image":"0b9516cb1a68ec24b753f02dd4580717efa40682.svg","url":"Measurable_acting_group"}
