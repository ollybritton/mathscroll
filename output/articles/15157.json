{"title":"Strophoid","summary":"In geometry, a strophoid is a curve generated from a given curve C and points A (the fixed point) and O (the pole) as follows: Let L be a variable line passing through O and intersecting C at K. Now let P1 and P2 be the two points on L whose distance from K is the same as the distance from A to K (i.e. KP1 = KP2 = AK). The locus of such points P1 and P2 is then the strophoid of C with respect to the pole O and fixed point A. Note that AP1 and AP2 are at right angles in this construction.","image":"Allgemeine_strophoide5.svg.png.webp","url":"Strophoid"}
