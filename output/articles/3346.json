{"title":"Contraction (operator theory)","summary":"In operator theory, a bounded operator T: X → Y between normed vector spaces X and Y is said to be a contraction if its operator norm ||T || ≤ 1. This notion is a special case of the concept of a contraction mapping, but every bounded operator becomes a contraction after suitable scaling. The analysis of contractions provides insight into the structure of operators, or a family of operators. The theory of contractions on Hilbert space is largely due to Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy and Ciprian Foias.","image":"19ef4c7b923a5125ac91aa491838a95ee15b804f.svg","url":"Contraction_(operator_theory)"}
