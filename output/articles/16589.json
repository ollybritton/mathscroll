{"title":"Vickrey auction","summary":"A Vickrey auction or sealed-bid second-price auction (SBSPA) is a type of sealed-bid auction. Bidders submit written bids without knowing the bid of the other people in the auction. The highest bidder wins but the price paid is the second-highest bid. This type of auction is strategically similar to an English auction and gives bidders an incentive to bid their true value. The auction was first described academically by Columbia University professor William Vickrey in 1961[1] though it had been used by stamp collectors since 1893.[2] In 1797 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe sold a manuscript using a sealed-bid, second-price auction.[3]","image":"Microcosm_of_London_Plate_006_-_Auction_Room%2C_Christie's_(colour).jpg.webp","url":"Vickrey_auction"}
