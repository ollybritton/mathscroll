{"title":"Sieve of Pritchard","summary":"In mathematics, the sieve of Pritchard is an algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified bound. Like the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, it has a simple conceptual basis in number theory.[1] It is especially suited to quick hand computation for small bounds.","image":"Sieve_of_Pritchard_animation.gif","url":"Sieve_of_Pritchard"}
