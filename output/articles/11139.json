{"title":"Non-Hausdorff manifold","summary":"In geometry and topology, it is a usual axiom of a manifold to be a Hausdorff space. In general topology, this axiom is relaxed, and one studies non-Hausdorff manifolds: spaces locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space, but not necessarily Hausdorff.","image":"c91b46e6554b0b95a4d65c0cc8c77aeaff4705ad.svg","url":"Non-Hausdorff_manifold"}
