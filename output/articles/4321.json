{"title":"Divergence","summary":"In vector calculus, divergence is a vector operator that operates on a vector field, producing a scalar field giving the quantity of the vector field's source at each point. More technically, the divergence represents the volume density of the outward flux of a vector field from an infinitesimal volume around a given point.","image":"Divergence_(captions).svg.png.webp","url":"Divergence"}
