{"title":"Prime k-tuple","summary":"In number theory, a prime k-tuple is a finite collection of values representing a repeatable pattern of differences between prime numbers.  For a k-tuple (a, b, …), the positions where the k-tuple matches a pattern in the prime numbers are given by the set of integers n such that all of the values (n + a, n + b, …) are prime. Typically the first value in the k-tuple is 0 and the rest are distinct positive even numbers.[1]","image":"7db552c2fda2f049746f2b1a3f0ac91264035c53.svg","url":"Prime_k-tuple"}
