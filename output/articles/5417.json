{"title":"Filter (large eddy simulation)","summary":"Filtering in the context of large eddy simulation (LES) is a mathematical operation intended to remove a range of small scales from the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations.  Because the principal difficulty in simulating turbulent flows comes from the wide range of length and time scales, this operation makes turbulent flow simulation cheaper by reducing the range of scales that must be resolved.  The LES filter operation is low-pass, meaning it filters out the scales associated with high frequencies.","image":"DNS_Velocity_Field.png.webp","url":"Filter_(large_eddy_simulation)"}
