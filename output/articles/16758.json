{"title":"Wavelet for multidimensional signals analysis","summary":"Wavelets are often used to analyse piece-wise smooth signals.[1] Wavelet coefficients can efficiently represent a signal which has led to data compression algorithms using wavelets.[2] Wavelet analysis is extended for multidimensional signal processing as well. This article introduces a few methods for wavelet synthesis and analysis for multidimensional signals. There also occur challenges such as directivity in multidimensional case.","image":"Wiki_figures_mod.001.png.webp","url":"Wavelet_for_multidimensional_signals_analysis"}
