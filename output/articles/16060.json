{"title":"Tridiagonal matrix","summary":"In linear algebra, a tridiagonal matrix is a band matrix that has nonzero elements only on the main diagonal, the subdiagonal/lower diagonal (the first diagonal below this), and the supradiagonal/upper diagonal (the first diagonal above the main diagonal). For example, the following matrix is tridiagonal:","image":"353a4862130008599653ed68ed0e2ae49cc2c455.svg","url":"Tridiagonal_matrix"}
