{"title":"Random dynamical system","summary":"In the mathematical field of dynamical systems, a random dynamical system is a dynamical system in which the equations of motion have an element of randomness to them. Random dynamical systems are characterized by a state space S, a set of maps Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } from S into itself that can be thought of as the set of all possible equations of motion, and a probability distribution Q on the set Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } that represents the random choice of map. Motion in a random dynamical system can be informally thought of as a state X ∈ S {\\displaystyle X\\in S} evolving according to a succession of maps randomly chosen according to the distribution Q.[1]","image":"4cfde86a3f7ec967af9955d0988592f0693d2b19.svg","url":"Random_dynamical_system"}
