{"title":"Injective tensor product","summary":"In mathematics, the injective tensor product of two topological vector spaces (TVSs) was introduced by Alexander Grothendieck and was used by him to define nuclear spaces.  An injective tensor product is in general not necessarily complete, so its completion is called the completed injective tensor products. Injective tensor products have applications outside of nuclear spaces. In particular, as described below, up to TVS-isomorphism, many TVSs that are defined for real or complex valued functions, for instance, the Schwartz space or the space of continuously differentiable functions, can be immediately extended to functions valued in a Hausdorff locally convex TVS Y {\\displaystyle Y} without any need to extend definitions (such as \"differentiable at a point\") from real/complex-valued functions to Y {\\displaystyle Y} -valued functions.","image":"961d67d6b454b4df2301ac571808a3538b3a6d3f.svg","url":"Injective_tensor_product"}
