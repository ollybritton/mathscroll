{"title":"Approximations of π","summary":"Approximations for the mathematical constant pi (π) in the history of mathematics reached an accuracy within 0.04% of the true value before the beginning of the Common Era. In Chinese mathematics, this was improved to approximations correct to what corresponds to about seven decimal digits by the 5th century.","image":"Record_pi_approximations.svg.png.webp","url":"Approximations_of_π"}
