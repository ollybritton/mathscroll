{"title":"Locally compact field","summary":"In algebra, a locally compact field is a topological field whose topology forms a locally compact Hausdorff space.[1] These kinds of fields were originally introduced in p-adic analysis since the fields Q p {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} _{p}} are locally compact topological spaces constructed from the norm | â‹… | p {\\displaystyle |\\cdot |_{p}} on Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } . The topology (and metric space structure) is essential because it allows one to construct analogues of algebraic number fields in the p-adic context.","image":"35f44bc6894c682710705f3ea74f33042e0acc3e.svg","url":"Locally_compact_field"}
