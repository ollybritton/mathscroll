{"title":"Extensions of symmetric operators","summary":"In functional analysis, one is interested in extensions of symmetric operators acting on a Hilbert space. Of particular importance is the existence, and sometimes explicit constructions, of self-adjoint extensions. This problem arises, for example, when one needs to specify domains of self-adjointness for formal expressions of observables in quantum mechanics. Other applications of solutions to this problem can be seen in various moment problems.","image":"3b148dd9277ab2b18762deba9d034b58832bb025.svg","url":"Extensions_of_symmetric_operators"}
