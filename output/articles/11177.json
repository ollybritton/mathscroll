{"title":"Nonelementary integral","summary":"In mathematics, a nonelementary antiderivative of a given elementary function is an antiderivative (or indefinite integral) that is, itself, not an elementary function (i.e. a function constructed from a finite number of quotients of constant, algebraic, exponential, trigonometric, and logarithmic functions using field operations).[1]  A theorem by Liouville in 1835 provided the first proof that nonelementary antiderivatives exist.[2] This theorem also provides a basis for the Risch algorithm for determining (with difficulty) which elementary functions have elementary antiderivatives.","image":"cb448ecd55c3a4e2274c86b345b01c55b644a2cc.svg","url":"Nonelementary_integral"}
