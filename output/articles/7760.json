{"title":"Infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure","summary":"In mathematics, there is a folklore claim that there is no analogue of Lebesgue measure on an infinite-dimensional Banach space. The theorem this refers to states that there is no translationally invariant measure on a separable Banach space - because if any ball has nonzero non-infinite volume, a slightly smaller ball has zero volume, and countable many such smaller balls cover the space. The folklore statement, however, is entirely false. The countable product of Lebesgue measure is translationally invariant and gives the intuitive notion of volume as the infinite product of lengths, only the domain on which this product measure is defined must necessarily be non-separable, and the measure itself is not sigma finite.","image":"b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a.svg","url":"Infinite-dimensional_Lebesgue_measure"}
