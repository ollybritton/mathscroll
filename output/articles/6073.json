{"title":"Generalized flag variety","summary":"In mathematics, a generalized flag variety (or simply flag variety) is a homogeneous space whose points are flags in a finite-dimensional vector space V over a field F. When F is the real or complex numbers, a generalized flag variety is a smooth or complex manifold, called a real or complex flag manifold. Flag varieties are naturally projective varieties.","image":"b61cfe3efa97cdfae17e85be311fbe9398aa20b4.svg","url":"Generalized_flag_variety"}
