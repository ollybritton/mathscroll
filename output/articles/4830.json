{"title":"Endrass surface","summary":"In algebraic geometry, an Endrass surface is a nodal surface of degree 8 with 168 real nodes, found by Stephan EndrassÂ (1997).[1] As of 2007, it remained the record-holder for the most number of real nodes for its degree;[2] however, the best proven upper bound, 174, does not match the lower bound given by this surface.[2][3]","image":"Endrass_surface.png.webp","url":"Endrass_surface"}
