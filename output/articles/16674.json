{"title":"Von Bertalanffy function","summary":"The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF), or von Bertalanffy curve, is a type of growth curve for a time series and is named after Ludwig von Bertalanffy. It is a special case of the generalised logistic function. The growth curve is used to model mean length from age in animals.[1] The function is commonly applied in ecology to model fish growth[2] and in paleontology to model sclerochronological parameters of shell growth.[3]","image":"Bulletin_-_Southern_California_Academy_of_Sciences_(2011)_(20495253222).jpg.webp","url":"Von_Bertalanffy_function"}
