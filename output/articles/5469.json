{"title":"First-countable space","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, a first-countable space is a topological space satisfying the \"first axiom of countability\". Specifically, a space X {\\displaystyle X} is said to be first-countable if each point has a countable neighbourhood basis (local base). That is, for each point x {\\displaystyle x} in X {\\displaystyle X} there exists a sequence N 1 , N 2 , â€¦ {\\displaystyle N_{1},N_{2},\\ldots } of neighbourhoods of x {\\displaystyle x} such that for any neighbourhood N {\\displaystyle N} of x {\\displaystyle x} there exists an integer i {\\displaystyle i} with N i {\\displaystyle N_{i}} contained in N . {\\displaystyle N.} Since every neighborhood of any point contains an open neighborhood of that point, the neighbourhood basis can be chosen without loss of generality to consist of open neighborhoods.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"First-countable_space"}
