{"title":"DTIME","summary":"In computational complexity theory, DTIME (or TIME) is the computational resource of computation time for a deterministic Turing machine.  It represents the amount of time (or number of computation steps) that a \"normal\" physical computer would take to solve a certain computational problem using a certain algorithm.  It is one of the most well-studied complexity resources, because it corresponds so closely to an important real-world resource (the amount of time it takes a computer to solve a problem).","image":"756b4d8648334719f65bf5e6269c7a2b3a502f13.svg","url":"DTIME"}
