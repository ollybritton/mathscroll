{"title":"Octal","summary":"The octal numeral system, or oct for short, is the base-8 number system, and uses the digits 0 to 7. This is to say that 10octal represents eight and 100octal represents sixty-four. However, English, like most languages, uses a base-10 number system, hence a true octal system might use different vocabulary.","image":"a79337e370dac156042f618e518bb41e369d55c1.svg","url":"Octal"}
