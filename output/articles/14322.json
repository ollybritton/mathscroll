{"title":"Siamese method","summary":"The Siamese method, or De la Loubère method, is a simple method to construct any size of n-odd magic squares (i.e. number squares in which the sums of all rows, columns and diagonals are identical). The method was brought to France in 1688 by the French mathematician and diplomat Simon de la Loubère,[1] as he was returning from his 1687 embassy to the kingdom  of Siam.[2][3][4] The Siamese method makes the creation of magic squares straightforward.","image":"SiameseMethod.gif","url":"Siamese_method"}
