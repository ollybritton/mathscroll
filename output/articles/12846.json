{"title":"Quantifier (logic)","summary":"In logic, a quantifier is an operator that specifies how many individuals in the domain of discourse satisfy an open formula. For instance, the universal quantifier ∀ {\\displaystyle \\forall } in the first order formula ∀ x P ( x ) {\\displaystyle \\forall xP(x)} expresses that everything in the domain satisfies the property denoted by P {\\displaystyle P} . On the other hand, the existential quantifier ∃ {\\displaystyle \\exists } in the formula ∃ x P ( x ) {\\displaystyle \\exists xP(x)} expresses that there exists something in the domain which satisfies that property. A formula where a quantifier takes widest scope is called a quantified formula. A quantified formula must contain a bound variable and a subformula specifying a property of the referent of that variable.","image":"bfc1a1a9c4c0f8d5df989c98aa2773ed657c5937.svg","url":"Quantifier_(logic)"}
