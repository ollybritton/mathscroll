{"title":"Turán's theorem","summary":"In graph theory, Turán's theorem bounds the number of edges that can be included in an undirected graph that does not have a complete subgraph of a given size. It is one of the central results of extremal graph theory, an area studying the largest or smallest graphs with given properties, and is a special case of the forbidden subgraph problem on the maximum number of edges in a graph that does not have a given subgraph.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Turán's_theorem"}
