{"title":"Conditional probability","summary":"In probability theory, conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring, given that another event (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) has already occurred.[1] This particular method relies on event B occurring with some sort of relationship with another event A. In this event, the event B can be analyzed by a conditional probability with respect to A. If the event of interest is A and the event B is known or assumed to have occurred, \"the conditional probability of A given B\", or \"the probability of A under the condition B\", is usually written as P(A|B)[2] or occasionally PB(A). This can also be understood as the fraction of probability B that intersects with A: P ( A ∣ B ) = P ( A ∩ B ) P ( B ) {\\displaystyle P(A\\mid B)={\\frac {P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}}} .[3]","image":"d1804505c0de877b843b29d645f394a9615e726b.svg","url":"Conditional_probability"}
