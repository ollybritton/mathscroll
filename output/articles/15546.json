{"title":"Teichmüller character","summary":"In number theory, the Teichmüller character ω (at a prime p) is a character of (Z/qZ)×, where q = p {\\displaystyle q=p} if p {\\displaystyle p} is odd and q = 4 {\\displaystyle q=4} if p = 2 {\\displaystyle p=2} , taking values in the roots of unity of the p-adic integers. It was introduced by Oswald Teichmüller. Identifying the roots of unity in the p-adic integers with the corresponding ones in the complex numbers, ω can be considered as a usual Dirichlet character of conductor q. More generally, given a complete discrete valuation ring O whose residue field k is perfect of characteristic p, there is a unique multiplicative section ω : k → O of the natural surjection O → k. The image of an element under this map is called its Teichmüller representative. The restriction of ω to k× is called the Teichmüller character.","image":"6556d4bc20dd360a033e78e8881de33e42c6e305.svg","url":"Teichmüller_character"}
