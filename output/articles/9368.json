{"title":"Linear least squares","summary":"Linear least squares (LLS) is the least squares approximation of linear functions to data. It is a set of formulations for solving statistical problems involved in linear regression, including variants for ordinary (unweighted), weighted, and generalized (correlated) residuals. Numerical methods for linear least squares include inverting the matrix of the normal equations and orthogonal decomposition methods.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Linear_least_squares"}
