{"title":"Latitude","summary":"In geography, latitude is a coordinate that specifies the north–south position of a point on the surface of the Earth or another celestial body. Latitude is given as an angle that ranges from –90° at the south pole to 90° at the north pole, with 0° at the Equator. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east–west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude and longitude are used together as a coordinate pair to specify a location on the surface of the Earth.","image":"Division_of_the_Earth_into_Gauss-Krueger_zones_-_Globe.svg.png.webp","url":"Latitude"}
