{"title":"Fusion frame","summary":"In mathematics, a fusion frame of a vector space is a natural extension of a frame. It is an additive construct of several, potentially \"overlapping\" frames. The motivation for this concept comes from the event that a signal can not be acquired by a single sensor alone (a constraint found by limitations of hardware or data throughput), rather the partial components of the signal must be collected via a network of sensors, and the partial signal representations are then fused into the complete signal.","image":"19ef4c7b923a5125ac91aa491838a95ee15b804f.svg","url":"Fusion_frame"}
