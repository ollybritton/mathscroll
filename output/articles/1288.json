{"title":"Ball-and-disk integrator","summary":"The ball-and-disk integrator is a key component of many advanced mechanical computers. Through simple mechanical means, it performs continual integration of the value of an input. Typical uses were the measurement of area or volume of material in industrial settings, range-keeping systems on ships, and tachometric bombsights. The addition of the torque amplifier by Vannevar Bush led to the differential analysers of the 1930s and 1940s.","image":"Harmonic_analyser_disc_and_sphere.jpg.webp","url":"Ball-and-disk_integrator"}
