{"title":"Proofs of trigonometric identities","summary":"There are several equivalent ways for defining trigonometric functions, and the proof of the trigonometric identities between them depend on the chosen definition. The oldest and somehow the most elementary definition is based on the geometry of right triangles. The proofs given in this article use this definition, and thus apply to non-negative angles not greater than a right angle. For greater and negative angles, see Trigonometric functions.","image":"8281efc1fdd2cf7ace9d6eef48da58082462dcd9.svg","url":"Proofs_of_trigonometric_identities"}
