{"title":"Characterizations of the exponential function","summary":"In mathematics, the exponential function can be characterized in many ways. The following characterizations (definitions) are most common. This article discusses why each characterization makes sense, and why the characterizations are independent of and equivalent to each other. As a special case of these considerations, it will be demonstrated that the three most common definitions given for the mathematical constant e are equivalent to each other.","image":"84d8d600bf1cd5a5033f67ec7f4eb84661d639bd.svg","url":"Characterizations_of_the_exponential_function"}
