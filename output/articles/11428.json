{"title":"Operad","summary":"In mathematics, an operad is a structure that consists of abstract operations, each one having a fixed finite number of inputs (arguments) and one output, as well as a specification of how to compose these operations. Given an operad O {\\displaystyle O} , one defines an algebra over O {\\displaystyle O} to be a set together with concrete operations on this set which behave just like the abstract operations of O {\\displaystyle O} . For instance, there is a Lie operad L {\\displaystyle L} such that the algebras over L {\\displaystyle L} are precisely the Lie algebras; in a sense L {\\displaystyle L} abstractly encodes the operations that are common to all Lie algebras.  An operad is to its algebras as a group is to its group representations.","image":"9d70e1d0d87e2ef1092ea1ffe2923d9933ff18fc.svg","url":"Operad"}
