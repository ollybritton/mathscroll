{"title":"Pentahexagonal pyritoheptacontatetrahedron","summary":"In geometry, a pentahexagonal pyritoheptacontatetrahedron is a near-miss Johnson solid with pyritohedral symmetry. This near-miss was discovered by Mason Green in 2006. It has 6 hexagonal faces, 12 pentagonal faces, and 56 triangles in 3 symmetry positions. Mason calls it a hexagonally expanded snubbed dodecahedron.[1]","image":"Pyritohedral_near-miss_johnson.png.webp","url":"Pentahexagonal_pyritoheptacontatetrahedron"}
