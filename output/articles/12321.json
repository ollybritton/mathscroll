{"title":"Polyhedral graph","summary":"In geometric graph theory, a branch of mathematics, a polyhedral graph is the undirected graph formed from the vertices and edges of a convex polyhedron. Alternatively, in purely graph-theoretic terms, the polyhedral graphs are the 3-vertex-connected, planar graphs.","image":"Dodecahedron_schlegel.svg.png.webp","url":"Polyhedral_graph"}
