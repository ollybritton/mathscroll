He shared the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics with William A. Fowler for \"...theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars\". His mathematical treatment of stellar evolution yielded many of the current theoretical models of the later evolutionary stages of massive stars and black holes.[5][6] Many concepts, institutions, and inventions, including the Chandrasekhar limit and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, are named after him.[7]","image":"Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar.gif","url":"Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar"}
