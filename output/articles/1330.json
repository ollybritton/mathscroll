{"title":"Barratt–Priddy theorem","summary":"In homotopy theory, a branch of mathematics, the Barratt–Priddy theorem (also referred to as Barratt–Priddy–Quillen theorem) expresses a connection between the homology of the symmetric groups and mapping spaces of spheres. The theorem (named after Michael Barratt, Stewart Priddy, and Daniel Quillen) is also often stated as a relation between the sphere spectrum and the classifying spaces of the symmetric groups via Quillen's plus construction.","image":"9a7d38598de85e31c40e6c28ca699dc1ba8bfe2d.svg","url":"Barratt–Priddy_theorem"}
