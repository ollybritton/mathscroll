{"title":"EP matrix","summary":"In mathematics, an EP matrix (or range-Hermitian matrix[1] or RPN matrix[2]) is a square matrix A whose range is equal to the range of its conjugate transpose A*. Another equivalent characterization of EP matrices is that the range of A is orthogonal to the nullspace of A. Thus, EP matrices are also known as RPN (Range Perpendicular to Nullspace) matrices.","image":"620948ebcd2536b29a9a46a19db956f30f219889.svg","url":"EP_matrix"}
