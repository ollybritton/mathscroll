{"title":"Kaniadakis statistics","summary":"Kaniadakis statistics (also known as κ-statistics) is a generalization of Boltzmann–Gibbs statistical mechanics,[1] based on a relativistic[2][3][4] generalization of the classical  Boltzmann–Gibbs–Shannon entropy (commonly referred to as Kaniadakis entropy or κ-entropy). Introduced by the Greek Italian physicist Giorgio Kaniadakis in 2001,[5] κ-statistical mechanics preserve the main features of ordinary statistical mechanics and have attracted the interest of many researchers in recent years. The κ-distribution is currently considered one of the most viable candidates for explaining complex physical,[6][7] natural or artificial systems involving power-law tailed statistical distributions. Kaniadakis statistics have been adopted successfully in the description of a variety of systems in the fields of cosmology, astrophysics,[8][9] condensed matter, quantum physics,[10][11] seismology,[12][13] genomics,[14][15] economics,[16][17] epidemiology,[18] and many others.","image":"Kappa_exponential_function_plot.png.webp","url":"Kaniadakis_statistics"}
