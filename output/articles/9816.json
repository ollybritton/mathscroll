{"title":"M5-brane","summary":"In theoretical physics, an M5-brane is a brane which carries magnetic charge, and the dual under electric-magnetic duality is the M2-brane. M5-brane is analogous to the NS5-brane in string theory. In addition, it is a soliton solution to M-theory.","image":"Calabi_yau_formatted.svg.png.webp","url":"M5-brane"}
