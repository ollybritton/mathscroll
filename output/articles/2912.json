{"title":"Communication complexity","summary":"In theoretical computer science, communication complexity studies the amount of communication required to solve a problem when the input to the problem is distributed among two or more parties. The study of communication complexity was first introduced by Andrew Yao in 1979, while studying the problem of computation distributed among several machines.[1] The problem is usually stated as follows: two parties (traditionally called Alice and Bob) each receive a (potentially different) n {\\displaystyle n} -bit string x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} . The goal is for Alice to compute the value of a certain function, f ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle f(x,y)} , that depends on both x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} , with the least amount of communication between them.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Communication_complexity"}
