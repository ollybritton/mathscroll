{"title":"Ring of integers","summary":"In mathematics, the ring of integers of an algebraic number field K {\\displaystyle K} is the ring of all algebraic integers contained in K {\\displaystyle K} .[1] An algebraic integer is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients: x n + c n − 1 x n − 1 + ⋯ + c 0 {\\displaystyle x^{n}+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots +c_{0}} .[2] This ring is often denoted by O K {\\displaystyle O_{K}} or O K {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}_{K}} . Since any integer belongs to K {\\displaystyle K} and is an integral element of K {\\displaystyle K} , the ring Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} } is always a subring of O K {\\displaystyle O_{K}} .","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Ring_of_integers"}
