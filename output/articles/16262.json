{"title":"Two-body Dirac equations","summary":"In quantum field theory, and in the significant subfields of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the two-body Dirac equations (TBDE) of constraint dynamics provide a three-dimensional yet manifestly covariant reformulation of the Bethe–Salpeter equation[1] for two spin-1/2 particles. Such a reformulation is necessary since without it, as shown by Nakanishi,[2] the Bethe–Salpeter equation possesses negative-norm solutions arising from the presence of an essentially relativistic degree of freedom, the relative time. These \"ghost\" states have spoiled the naive interpretation of the Bethe–Salpeter equation as a quantum mechanical wave equation. The two-body Dirac equations of constraint dynamics rectify this flaw. The forms of these equations can not only be derived from quantum field theory [3][4] they can also be derived purely in the context of Dirac's constraint dynamics [5][6] and relativistic mechanics and quantum mechanics.[7][8][9][10] Their structures, unlike the more familiar two-body Dirac equation of Breit,[11][12][13] which is a single equation, are that of two simultaneous quantum relativistic wave equations. A single two-body Dirac equation similar to the Breit equation can be derived from the TBDE.[14]  Unlike the Breit equation, it is manifestly covariant and free from the types of singularities that prevent a strictly nonperturbative treatment of the Breit equation.[15]","image":"Feynmann_Diagram_Gluon_Radiation.svg.png.webp","url":"Two-body_Dirac_equations"}
