{"title":"H square","summary":"In mathematics and control theory, H2, or H-square is a Hardy space with square norm. It is a subspace of L2 space, and is thus a Hilbert space.  In particular, it is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.","image":"5a64e9414d7c558cfc0e40c92f244468be4a8a75.svg","url":"H_square"}
