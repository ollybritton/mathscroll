{"title":"Hurdle model","summary":"A hurdle model is a class of statistical models where a random variable is modelled using two parts, the first which is the probability of attaining value 0, and the second part models the probability of the non-zero values. The use of hurdle models are often motivated by an excess of zero's in the data, that is not sufficiently accounted for in more standard statistical models.","image":"e0c137fd2172511ae9b385f5b9d56e382c0c1630.svg","url":"Hurdle_model"}
