{"title":"Enumerations of specific permutation classes","summary":"In the study of permutation patterns, there has been considerable interest in enumerating specific permutation classes, especially those with relatively few basis elements. This area of study has turned up unexpected instances of Wilf equivalence, where two seemingly-unrelated permutation classes have the same numbers of permutations of each length.","image":"e1af42d90f380d2623d2e7152eeea3e4f5349973.svg","url":"Enumerations_of_specific_permutation_classes"}
