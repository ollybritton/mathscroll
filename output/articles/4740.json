{"title":"Ellipsoid method","summary":"In mathematical optimization, the ellipsoid method is an iterative method for minimizing convex functions. When specialized to solving feasible linear optimization problems with rational data, the ellipsoid method is an  algorithm which finds an optimal solution in a number of steps that is polynomial in the input size.","image":"Ellipsoid_2.png.webp","url":"Ellipsoid_method"}
