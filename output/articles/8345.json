{"title":"John Hazzidakis","summary":"Ioannis \"John\" N. Hazzidakis (Ιωάννης Χατζιδάκις, or Hatzidakis or Chatzidakis, April 13, 1844 – 1921) was a Greek mathematician, physicist, author, and professor.  He is one of the most important mathematicians of the modern Greek scientific era.    His professor was world renowned Greek mathematician Vassilios Lakon.  He also studied with famous German mathematicians Ernst Kummer, Leopold Kronecker, Karl Weierstrass.  He systematically worked in the field of research and education.  He wrote textbooks in the field of algebra, geometry, and calculus.  Hazzidakis essentially adopted some elements of Lacon's Geometry.  He introduced the Hazzidakis transform in differential geometry.  [1][2][3][4] The Hazzidakis formula for the Hazzidakis transform can be applied in proving Hilbert's theorem on negative curvature, stating that hyperbolic geometry does not have a model in 3-dimensional Euclidean space.[5][6]","image":"Das_Fotoalbum_für_Weierstraß_038_(Johannes_Hazzidakis).jpg.webp","url":"John_Hazzidakis"}
