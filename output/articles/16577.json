{"title":"Vertex configuration","summary":"In geometry, a vertex configuration[1][2][3][4]  is a shorthand notation for representing the vertex figure of a polyhedron or tiling as the sequence of faces around a vertex. For uniform polyhedra there is only one vertex type and therefore the vertex configuration fully defines the polyhedron. (Chiral polyhedra exist in mirror-image pairs with the same vertex configuration.)","image":"Icosidodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Vertex_configuration"}
