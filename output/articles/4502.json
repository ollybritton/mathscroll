{"title":"Dual wavelet","summary":"In mathematics, a dual wavelet is the dual to a wavelet. In general, the wavelet series generated by a square-integrable function will have a dual series, in the sense of the Riesz representation theorem. However, the dual series is not itself in general representable by a square-integrable function.","image":"a9d253eb89bf049ef6fb04c903e14ad1629f5a56.svg","url":"Dual_wavelet"}
