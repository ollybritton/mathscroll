{"title":"Dulmage–Mendelsohn decomposition","summary":"In graph theory, the Dulmage–Mendelsohn decomposition is a partition of the vertices of a bipartite graph into subsets, with the property that two adjacent vertices belong to the same subset if and only if they are paired with each other in a perfect matching of the graph. It is named after A. L. Dulmage and Nathan Mendelsohn, who published it in 1958.[1]  A generalization to any graph is the Edmonds–Gallai decomposition, using the Blossom algorithm.","image":"Even-odd-decomposition.svg.png.webp","url":"Dulmage–Mendelsohn_decomposition"}
