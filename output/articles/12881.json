{"title":"Quarter 5-cubic honeycomb","summary":"In five-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the quarter 5-cubic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). It has half the vertices of the 5-demicubic honeycomb, and a quarter of the vertices of a 5-cube honeycomb.[1] Its facets are 5-demicubes and runcinated 5-demicubes.","image":"CDel_nodes_10ru.png.webp","url":"Quarter_5-cubic_honeycomb"}
