{"title":"Cellular approximation theorem","summary":"In algebraic topology, the cellular approximation theorem states that a map between CW-complexes can always be taken to be of a specific type. Concretely, if X and Y are CW-complexes, and f : X → Y is a continuous map, then f is said to be cellular, if f takes the n-skeleton of X to the n-skeleton of Y for all n, i.e. if f ( X n ) ⊆ Y n {\\displaystyle f(X^{n})\\subseteq Y^{n}} for all n. The content of the cellular approximation theorem is then that any continuous map f : X → Y between CW-complexes X and Y is homotopic to a cellular map, and if f is already cellular on a subcomplex A of X, then we can furthermore choose the homotopy to be stationary on A. From an algebraic topological viewpoint, any map between CW-complexes can thus be taken to be cellular.","image":"b3d6c6ad19dcde6a32ba4283503507ca11e63cc7.svg","url":"Cellular_approximation_theorem"}
