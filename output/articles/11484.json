{"title":"Order-4 square tiling honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the order-4 square tiling honeycomb is one of 11 paracompact regular honeycombs. It is paracompact because it has infinite cells and vertex figures, with all vertices as ideal points at infinity. Given by Schl√§fli symbol {4,4,4}, it has four square tilings around each edge, and infinite square tilings around each vertex in a square tiling vertex figure.[1]","image":"H3_444_FC_boundary.png.webp","url":"Order-4_square_tiling_honeycomb"}
