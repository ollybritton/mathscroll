{"title":"Sheaf cohomology","summary":"In mathematics, sheaf cohomology is the application of homological algebra to analyze the global sections of a sheaf on a topological space. Broadly speaking, sheaf cohomology describes the obstructions to solving a geometric problem globally when it can be solved locally. The central work for the study of sheaf cohomology is Grothendieck's 1957 TÃ´hoku paper.","image":"183430a88117f1e77462cf34d4f84b2a353e81e1.svg","url":"Sheaf_cohomology"}
