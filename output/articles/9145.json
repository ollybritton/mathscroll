{"title":"Left-right planarity test","summary":"In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, the left-right planarity test or de Fraysseix–Rosenstiehl planarity criterion[1] is a characterization of planar graphs based on the properties of the depth-first search trees, published by de Fraysseix and  Rosenstiehl (1982, 1985)[2][3] and used by them with Patrice Ossona de Mendez to develop a linear time planarity testing algorithm.[4][5] In a 2003 experimental comparison of six planarity testing algorithms, this was one of the fastest algorithms tested.[6]","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg","url":"Left-right_planarity_test"}
