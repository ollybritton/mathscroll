{"title":"Spherical sector","summary":"In geometry, a spherical sector,[1] also known as a spherical cone,[2] is a portion of a sphere or of a ball defined by a conical boundary with apex at the center of the sphere. It can be described as the union of a spherical cap and the cone formed by the center of the sphere and the base of the cap. It is the three-dimensional analogue of the sector of a circle.","image":"Kugel-sektor.png.webp","url":"Spherical_sector"}
