{"title":"Kadison transitivity theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Kadison transitivity theorem is a result in the theory of C*-algebras that, in effect, asserts the equivalence of the notions of topological irreducibility and algebraic irreducibility of representations of C*-algebras. It implies that, for irreducible representations of C*-algebras, the only non-zero linear invariant subspace is the whole space.","image":"205d4b91000d9dcf1a5bbabdfa6a8395fa60b676.svg","url":"Kadison_transitivity_theorem"}
