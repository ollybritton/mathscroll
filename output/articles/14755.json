{"title":"Spectrum (functional analysis)","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in functional analysis, the spectrum of a bounded linear operator (or, more generally, an unbounded linear operator) is a generalisation of the set of eigenvalues of a matrix.  Specifically, a complex number λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } is said to be in the spectrum of a bounded linear operator T {\\displaystyle T} if T − λ I {\\displaystyle T-\\lambda I}","image":"b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a.svg","url":"Spectrum_(functional_analysis)"}
