{"title":"Material conditional","summary":"The material conditional (also known as material implication) is an operation commonly used in logic. When the conditional symbol → {\\displaystyle \\rightarrow } is interpreted as material implication, a formula P → Q {\\displaystyle P\\rightarrow Q} is true unless P {\\displaystyle P} is true and Q {\\displaystyle Q} is false. Material implication can also be characterized inferentially by modus ponens, modus tollens, conditional proof, and classical reductio ad absurdum.","image":"53e574cc3aa5b4bf5f3f5906caf121a378eef08b.svg","url":"Material_conditional"}
