{"title":"Chow variety","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in the field of algebraic geometry, a Chow variety is an algebraic variety whose points correspond to effective algebraic cycles of fixed dimension and degree on a given projective space. More precisely, the Chow variety[1] Gr ⁡ ( k , d , n ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Gr} (k,d,n)} is the fine moduli variety parametrizing all effective algebraic cycles of dimension k − 1 {\\displaystyle k-1} and degree d {\\displaystyle d} in P n − 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} ^{n-1}} .","image":"f1dc75912329db7d91aa86412cca791c380bc744.svg","url":"Chow_variety"}
