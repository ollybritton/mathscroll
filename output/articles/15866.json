{"title":"Topological vector lattice","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in functional analysis and order theory, a topological vector lattice is a Hausdorff topological vector space (TVS) X {\\displaystyle X} that has a partial order â‰¤ {\\displaystyle \\,\\leq \\,} making it into vector lattice that is possesses a neighborhood base at the origin consisting of solid sets.[1] Ordered vector lattices have important applications in spectral theory.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Topological_vector_lattice"}
