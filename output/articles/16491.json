{"title":"Valuation (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a valuation is a finitely additive function on a collection of admissible subsets of a fixed set X {\\displaystyle X} with values in an abelian semigroup. For example, the Lebesgue measure is a valuation on finite unions of convex bodies (that is, non-empty compact convex sets) of Euclidean space R n . {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}.} Other examples of valuations  on finite unions of convex bodies are the surface area, the mean width, and the Euler characteristic.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Valuation_(geometry)"}
