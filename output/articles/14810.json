{"title":"Spin representation","summary":"In mathematics, the spin representations are particular projective representations of the orthogonal or special orthogonal groups in arbitrary dimension and signature (i.e., including indefinite orthogonal groups). More precisely, they are two equivalent representations of the spin groups, which are double covers of the special orthogonal groups. They are usually studied over the real or complex numbers, but they can be defined over other fields.","image":"f64d0daa3e6ab8489d34cd391caff23c14a51e6f.svg","url":"Spin_representation"}
