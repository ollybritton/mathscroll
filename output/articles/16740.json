{"title":"Waring's problem","summary":"In number theory, Waring's problem asks whether each natural number k has an associated positive integer s such that every natural number is the sum of at most s natural numbers raised to the power k. For example, every natural number is the sum of at most 4 squares, 9 cubes, or 19 fourth powers. Waring's problem was proposed in 1770 by Edward Waring, after whom it is named. Its affirmative answer, known as the Hilbertâ€“Waring theorem, was provided by Hilbert in 1909.[1] Waring's problem has its own Mathematics Subject Classification, 11P05, \"Waring's problem and variants\".","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Waring's_problem"}
