{"title":"Quasi-finite field","summary":"In mathematics, a quasi-finite field[1] is a generalisation of a finite field. Standard local class field theory usually deals with complete valued fields whose residue field is finite (i.e. non-archimedean local fields), but the theory applies equally well when the residue field is only assumed quasi-finite.[2]","image":"78a25ece50131e8812827fe6f138bf3f65431326.svg","url":"Quasi-finite_field"}
