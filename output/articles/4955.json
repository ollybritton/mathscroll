{"title":"Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem limits the number of sets in a family of sets for which every two sets have at least one element in common. Paul Erdős, Chao Ko, and Richard Rado proved the theorem in 1938, but did not publish it until 1961. It is part of the field of combinatorics, and one of the central results of extremal set theory.[1]","image":"Intersecting_set_families_2-of-4.svg.png.webp","url":"Erdős–Ko–Rado_theorem"}
