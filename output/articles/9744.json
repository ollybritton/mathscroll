{"title":"Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, the Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality, more commonly known as the LYM inequality, is an inequality on the sizes of sets in a Sperner family, proved by Bollobás (1965), Lubell (1966), Meshalkin (1963), and  Yamamoto (1954). It is named for the initials of three of its discoverers. To include the initials of all four discoverers, it is sometimes referred to as the YBLM inequality.","image":"5cc79bc56d4343a84eb84dfdbb0444773e5d6afa.svg","url":"Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin_inequality"}
