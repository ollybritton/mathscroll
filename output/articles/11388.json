{"title":"Omega-categorical theory","summary":"In mathematical logic, an omega-categorical theory is a theory that has exactly one countably infinite model up to isomorphism.  Omega-categoricity is the special case κ = ℵ 0 {\\displaystyle \\aleph _{0}} = ω of κ-categoricity, and omega-categorical theories are also referred to as ω-categorical.  The notion is most important for countable first-order theories.","image":"721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1.svg","url":"Omega-categorical_theory"}
