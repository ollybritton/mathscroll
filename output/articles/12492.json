{"title":"Prime omega function","summary":"In number theory, the prime omega functions ω ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\omega (n)} and Ω ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\Omega (n)} count the number of prime factors of a natural number n . {\\displaystyle n.} Thereby ω ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\omega (n)} (little omega) counts each distinct prime factor, whereas the related function Ω ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\Omega (n)} (big omega) counts the total number of prime factors of n , {\\displaystyle n,} honoring their multiplicity (see arithmetic function). That is, if we have a prime factorization of n {\\displaystyle n} of the form n = p 1 α 1 p 2 α 2 ⋯ p k α k {\\displaystyle n=p_{1}^{\\alpha _{1}}p_{2}^{\\alpha _{2}}\\cdots p_{k}^{\\alpha _{k}}} for distinct primes p i {\\displaystyle p_{i}} ( 1 ≤ i ≤ k {\\displaystyle 1\\leq i\\leq k} ), then the respective prime omega functions are given by ω ( n ) = k {\\displaystyle \\omega (n)=k} and Ω ( n ) = α 1 + α 2 + ⋯ + α k {\\displaystyle \\Omega (n)=\\alpha _{1}+\\alpha _{2}+\\cdots +\\alpha _{k}} . These prime factor counting functions have many important number theoretic relations.","image":"f9e1e190faf1ba7931e4e98594df6097d297bed1.svg","url":"Prime_omega_function"}
