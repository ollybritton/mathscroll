{"title":"Active and passive transformation","summary":"In analytic geometry, spatial transformations in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} are distinguished into active or alibi transformations, and passive or alias transformations. An active transformation[1] is a transformation which actually changes the physical position (alibi, elsewhere) of a point, or rigid body, which can be defined in the absence of a coordinate system; whereas a passive transformation[2] is merely a change in the coordinate system in which the object is described (alias, other name) (change of coordinate map, or change of basis). By transformation, mathematicians usually refer to active transformations, while physicists and engineers could mean either. Both types of transformation can be represented by a combination of a translation and a linear transformation.","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg","url":"Active_and_passive_transformation"}
