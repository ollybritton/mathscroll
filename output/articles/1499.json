{"title":"Bernstein's problem","summary":"In differential geometry, Bernstein's problem is as follows: if the graph of a function on Rn−1 is a minimal surface in Rn, does this imply that the function is linear? This is true in dimensions n at most 8, but false in dimensions n at least 9.  The problem is named for Sergei Natanovich Bernstein who solved the case n = 3 in 1914.","image":"ef69dded6078f5a05dcd1465a6e9dac61e8deb77.svg","url":"Bernstein's_problem"}
