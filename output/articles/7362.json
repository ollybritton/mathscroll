{"title":"Homological algebra","summary":"Homological algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies homology in a general algebraic setting. It is a relatively young discipline, whose origins can be traced to investigations in combinatorial topology (a precursor to algebraic topology) and abstract algebra (theory of modules and syzygies) at the end of the 19th century, chiefly by Henri Poincar√© and David Hilbert.","image":"Snake_lemma_origin.svg.png.webp","url":"Homological_algebra"}
