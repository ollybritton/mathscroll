{"title":"Distance geometry","summary":"Distance geometry is the  branch of mathematics concerned with characterizing and studying sets of points based only on given values of the distances between pairs of points.[1][2][3] More abstractly, it is the study of semimetric spaces and the isometric transformations between them. In this view, it can be considered as a subject within general topology.[4]","image":"Hyperbolic_Navigation.svg.png.webp","url":"Distance_geometry"}
