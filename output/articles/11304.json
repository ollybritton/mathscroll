{"title":"Numerov's method","summary":"Numerov's method (also called  Cowell's method) is a numerical method to solve ordinary differential equations of second order in which the first-order term does not appear. It is a fourth-order linear multistep method. The method is implicit, but can be made explicit if the differential equation is linear.","image":"3053f4d493a4bf8546c77f550f1e1264debc437e.svg","url":"Numerov's_method"}
