{"title":"False positive rate","summary":"In statistics, when performing multiple comparisons, a false positive ratio (also known as fall-out or false alarm ratio) is the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis for a particular test. The false positive rate is calculated as the ratio between the number of negative events wrongly categorized as positive (false positives) and the total number of actual negative events (regardless of classification).","image":"c5119dc2a74e72317ac2274c5b0d4d562597d8af.svg","url":"False_positive_rate"}
