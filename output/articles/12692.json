{"title":"Pr端fer rank","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the area of algebra known as group theory, the Pr端fer rank of a pro-p group measures the size of a group in terms of the ranks of its elementary abelian sections.[1] The rank is well behaved and helps to define analytic pro-p-groups.  The term is named after Heinz Pr端fer.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Pr端fer_rank"}
