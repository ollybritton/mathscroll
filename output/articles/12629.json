{"title":"Projectivization","summary":"In mathematics, projectivization is a procedure which associates with a non-zero vector space V a projective space P ( V ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathbb {P} }(V)} , whose elements are one-dimensional subspaces of V. More generally, any subset S of V closed under scalar multiplication defines a subset of P ( V ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathbb {P} }(V)} formed by the lines contained in S and is called the projectivization of S.","image":"2a12237df6816d4cd3f39fa922731f5044baef85.svg","url":"Projectivization"}
