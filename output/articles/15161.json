{"title":"Structural cut-off","summary":"The structural cut-off is a concept in network science which imposes a degree cut-off in the degree distribution of a finite size network due to structural limitations (such as the simple graph property).  Networks with vertices with degree higher than the structural cut-off will display structural disassortativity.","image":"Internet_map_1024.jpg.webp","url":"Structural_cut-off"}
