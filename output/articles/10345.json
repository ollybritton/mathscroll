{"title":"Metalanguage","summary":"In logic and linguistics, a metalanguage is a language used to describe another language, often called the object language.[1] Expressions in a metalanguage are often distinguished from those in the object language by the use of italics, quotation marks, or writing on a separate line. The structure of sentences and phrases in a metalanguage can be described by a metasyntax.[2] For example, to say that the word \"noun\" can be used as a noun in a sentence, one could write \"noun\" is a <noun>.","image":"db742b8c210fc611329a4c2dcc3af4b4e1a110cb.svg","url":"Metalanguage"}
