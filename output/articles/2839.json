{"title":"Cohen–Hewitt factorization theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Cohen–Hewitt factorization theorem states that if V {\\displaystyle V} is a left module over a Banach algebra B {\\displaystyle B} with a left approximate unit ( u i ) i ∈ I {\\displaystyle (u_{i})_{i\\in I}} , then an element v {\\displaystyle v} of V {\\displaystyle V} can be factorized as a product v = b w {\\displaystyle v=bw} (for some b ∈ B {\\displaystyle b\\in B} and w ∈ V {\\displaystyle w\\in V} ) whenever lim i ∈ I u i v = v {\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\lim _{i\\in I}u_{i}v=v} . The theorem was introduced by Paul Cohen (1959) and Edwin Hewitt (1964).","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Cohen–Hewitt_factorization_theorem"}
