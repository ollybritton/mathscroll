{"title":"Blattner's conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, Blattner's conjecture or Blattner's formula is a description of the discrete series representations of a general semisimple group G in terms of their restricted representations to a maximal compact subgroup K (their so-called K-types). It is named after Robert James Blattner, despite not being formulated as a conjecture by him.","image":"2e8fba8bd879025f39c8fb0be4bd6401f9f4f3cc.svg","url":"Blattner's_conjecture"}
