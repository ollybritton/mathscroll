{"title":"j-invariant","summary":"In mathematics, Felix Klein's j-invariant or j function, regarded as a function of a complex variable τ, is a modular function of weight zero for SL(2, Z) defined on the upper half-plane of complex numbers. It is the unique such function which is holomorphic away from a simple pole at the cusp such that","image":"63937eeb858a561b4f622691438bd488a4f07e18.svg","url":"J-invariant"}
