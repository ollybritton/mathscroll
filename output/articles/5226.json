{"title":"Extremal length","summary":"In the mathematical theory of conformal and quasiconformal mappings, the extremal length of a collection of curves Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } is a measure of the size of Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } that is invariant under conformal mappings. More specifically, suppose that D {\\displaystyle D} is an open set in the complex plane and Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } is a collection of paths in D {\\displaystyle D} and f : D → D ′ {\\displaystyle f:D\\to D'} is a conformal mapping. Then the extremal length of Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } is equal to the extremal length of the image of Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } under f {\\displaystyle f} . One also works with the conformal modulus of Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } , the reciprocal of the extremal length.  The fact that extremal length and conformal modulus are conformal invariants of Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } makes them useful tools in the study of conformal and quasi-conformal mappings. One also works with extremal length in dimensions greater than two and certain other metric spaces, but the following deals primarily with the two dimensional setting.","image":"4cfde86a3f7ec967af9955d0988592f0693d2b19.svg","url":"Extremal_length"}
