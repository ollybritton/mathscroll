{"title":"Power rule","summary":"In calculus, the power rule is used to differentiate functions of the form f ( x ) = x r {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{r}} , whenever r {\\displaystyle r} is a real number. Since differentiation is a linear operation on the space of differentiable functions, polynomials can also be differentiated using this rule. The power rule underlies the Taylor series as it relates a power series with a function's derivatives.","image":"6b12c5ad6dc7d9310aef2097252a8c704e58612f.svg","url":"Power_rule"}
