{"title":"Free module","summary":"In mathematics, a free module is a module that has a basis â€“ that is, a generating set consisting of linearly independent elements. Every vector space is a free module,[1] but, if the ring of the coefficients is not a division ring (not a field in the commutative case), then there exist non-free modules.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Free_module"}
