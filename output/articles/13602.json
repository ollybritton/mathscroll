{"title":"Ringed space","summary":"In mathematics, a ringed space is a family of (commutative) rings parametrized by open subsets of a topological space together with ring homomorphisms that play roles of restrictions. Precisely, it is a topological space equipped with a sheaf of rings called a structure sheaf. It is an abstraction of the concept of the rings of continuous (scalar-valued) functions on open subsets.","image":"46716c1fec068ffe9981107a5a215fa1fc9e7d5f.svg","url":"Ringed_space"}
