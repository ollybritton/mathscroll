{"title":"Closed set","summary":"In geometry, topology, and related branches of mathematics, a closed set is a set whose complement is an open set.[1][2] In a topological space, a closed set can be defined as a set which contains all its limit points. In a complete metric space, a closed set is a set which is closed under the limit operation. This should not be confused with a closed manifold.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Closed_set"}
