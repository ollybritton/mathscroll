{"title":"Kostka number","summary":"In mathematics, the Kostka number K λ μ {\\displaystyle K_{\\lambda \\mu }} (depending on two integer partitions λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } and μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } ) is a non-negative integer that is equal to the number of semistandard Young tableaux of shape λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } and weight μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } .  They were introduced by the mathematician Carl Kostka in his study of symmetric functions (Kostka (1882)).[1]","image":"7edb0fc88f8b52729c1bae08cea098ef40812efd.svg","url":"Kostka_number"}
