{"title":"Weaire–Phelan structure","summary":"In geometry, the Weaire–Phelan structure is a three-dimensional structure representing an idealised foam of equal-sized bubbles, with two different shapes.  In  1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan found that this structure was a better solution of the Kelvin problem of tiling space by equal volume cells of minimum surface area than the previous best-known solution, the Kelvin structure.[1]","image":"12-14-hedral_honeycomb.png.webp","url":"Weaire–Phelan_structure"}
