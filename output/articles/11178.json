{"title":"Nonhypotenuse number","summary":"In mathematics, a nonhypotenuse number is a natural number whose square cannot be written as the sum of two nonzero squares. The name stems from the fact that an edge of length equal to a nonhypotenuse number cannot form the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle with integer sides.","image":"Triangle345.svg.png.webp","url":"Nonhypotenuse_number"}
