{"title":"Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means","summary":"In mathematics, the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, or more briefly the AMâ€“GM inequality, states that the arithmetic mean of a list of non-negative real numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same list; and further, that the two means are equal if and only if every number in the list is the same (in which case they are both that number).","image":"AM_GM_inequality_visual_proof.svg.png.webp","url":"Inequality_of_arithmetic_and_geometric_means"}
