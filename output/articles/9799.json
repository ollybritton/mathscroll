{"title":"Lévy hierarchy","summary":"In set theory and mathematical logic, the Lévy hierarchy, introduced by Azriel Lévy in 1965, is a hierarchy of formulas in the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, which is typically called just the language of set theory. This is analogous to the arithmetical hierarchy, which provides a similar classification for sentences of the language of arithmetic.","image":"91f7527af045cf264afc60e693b1b93255a7a81e.svg","url":"Lévy_hierarchy"}
