{"title":"Metric map","summary":"In the mathematical theory of metric spaces, a metric map is a function between metric spaces that does not increase any distance (such functions are always  continuous). These maps are the morphisms in the category of metric spaces, Met (Isbell 1964). They are also called Lipschitz functions with Lipschitz constant 1, nonexpansive maps, nonexpanding maps, weak contractions, or short maps.","image":"3d802e9e3d86c1c39dd6e4387950e59dc7a41ac8.svg","url":"Metric_map"}
