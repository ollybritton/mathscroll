{"title":"Claude Gaspar Bachet de Méziriac","summary":"Claude Gaspar Bachet Sieur de Méziriac[1] (9 October 1581 – 26 February 1638) was a French mathematician and poet born in Bourg-en-Bresse, at that time belonging to Duchy of Savoy.[2] He wrote Problèmes plaisans et délectables qui se font par les nombres[note 1], Les éléments arithmétiques[note 2], and a Latin translation of the Arithmetica of Diophantus (the very translation where Fermat wrote a margin note about Fermat's Last Theorem). He also discovered means of solving indeterminate equations using continued fractions, a method of constructing magic squares, and a proof of Bézout's identity.","image":"Claude_Gaspard_Bachet_de_Méziriac_-_Versailles_MV_2893.jpg.webp","url":"Claude_Gaspar_Bachet_de_Méziriac"}
