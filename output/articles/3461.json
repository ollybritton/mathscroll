{"title":"Correlation immunity","summary":"In mathematics, the correlation immunity of a Boolean function is a measure of the degree to which its outputs are uncorrelated with some subset of its inputs. Specifically, a Boolean function is said to be correlation-immune of order m if every subset of m or fewer variables in x 1 , x 2 , … , x n {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{n}} is statistically independent of the value of f ( x 1 , x 2 , … , x n ) {\\displaystyle f(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{n})} .","image":"8694289524164f895d6665f163e14c4dc5ec648d.svg","url":"Correlation_immunity"}
