{"title":"Path integrals in polymer science","summary":"A polymer is a macromolecule, composed of many similar or identical repeated subunits. Polymers are common in, but not limited to, organic media. They range from familiar synthetic plastics to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins. Their unique elongated molecular structure produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures. The modern concept of polymers as covalently bonded macromolecular structures was proposed in 1920 by Hermann Staudinger.[1] One sub-field in the study of polymers is polymer physics. As a part of soft matter studies, Polymer physics concerns itself with the study of mechanical properties[2] and focuses on the perspective of condensed matter physics.","image":"QuantumPhaseTransition.svg.png.webp","url":"Path_integrals_in_polymer_science"}
