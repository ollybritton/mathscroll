{"title":"Tree (set theory)","summary":"In set theory, a tree is a partially ordered set (T, <) such that for each t ∈ T, the set {s ∈ T : s < t} is well-ordered by the relation <. Frequently trees are assumed to have only one root (i.e. minimal element), as the typical questions investigated in this field are easily reduced to questions about single-rooted trees.","image":"a8995c9247a5387f03ae044d2f51f9030c377bed.svg","url":"Tree_(set_theory)"}
