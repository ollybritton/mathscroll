{"title":"Welfare maximization","summary":"The welfare maximization problem is an optimization problem studied in economics and computer science. Its goal is to partition a set of items among agents with different utility functions, such that the welfare – defined as the sum of the agents' utilities – is as high as possible. In other words, the goal is to find an item allocation satisfying the utilitarian rule.[1]","image":"f250a7377d8e6be1f73e8c8958b774b66c52d902.svg","url":"Welfare_maximization"}
