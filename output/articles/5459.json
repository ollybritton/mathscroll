{"title":"Finitely generated algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a finitely generated algebra (also called an algebra of finite type) is a commutative associative algebra A over a field K where there exists a finite set of elements a1,...,an of A such that every element of A can be expressed as a polynomial in a1,...,an, with coefficients in K.","image":"22cb7c1bd03dc36742456051ebcdf69a73b2244d.svg","url":"Finitely_generated_algebra"}
