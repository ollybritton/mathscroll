{"title":"Auxiliary function","summary":"In mathematics, auxiliary functions are an important construction in transcendental number theory.  They are functions that appear in most proofs in this area of mathematics and that have specific, desirable properties, such as taking the value zero for many arguments, or having a zero of high order at some point.[1]","image":"169f413aa15244a32c7254d175917fa3f678a8e2.svg","url":"Auxiliary_function"}
