{"title":"Semistable reduction theorem","summary":"In algebraic geometry, semistable reduction theorems state that, given a proper flat morphism X → S {\\displaystyle X\\to S} , there exists a morphism S ′ → S {\\displaystyle S'\\to S} (called base change) such that X × S S ′ → S ′ {\\displaystyle X\\times _{S}S'\\to S'} is semistable (i.e., the singularities are mild in some sense). Precise formulations depend on the specific versions of the theorem. For example, if S {\\displaystyle S} is the unit disk in C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } , then \"semistable\" means that the special fiber is a divisor with normal crossings.[1]","image":"3496d15a6102a8883ca2f5d33afd25d2d7dc9f4d.svg","url":"Semistable_reduction_theorem"}
