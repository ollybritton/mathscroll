{"title":"Gradient pattern analysis","summary":"Gradient pattern analysis (GPA)[1] is a geometric computing method for characterizing geometrical bilateral symmetry breaking of an ensemble of symmetric vectors regularly distributed in a square lattice. Usually, the lattice of vectors represent the first-order gradient of a scalar field, here an M x M square amplitude matrix. An important property of the gradient representation is the following: A given M x M matrix where all amplitudes are different results in an M x M gradient lattice containing N V = M 2 {\\displaystyle N_{V}=M^{2}} asymmetric vectors. As each vector can be characterized by its norm and phase, variations in the M 2 {\\displaystyle M^{2}} amplitudes can modify the respective M 2 {\\displaystyle M^{2}} gradient pattern.","image":"984ea73beef9874df31bd840c4bd3fca981d2cbb.svg","url":"Gradient_pattern_analysis"}
