{"title":"Differentiable function","summary":"In mathematics, a differentiable function of one real variable is a function whose derivative exists at each point in its domain. In other words, the graph of a differentiable function has a non-vertical tangent line at each interior point in its domain. A differentiable function is smooth (the function is locally well approximated as a linear function at each interior point) and does not contain any break, angle, or cusp.","image":"Polynomialdeg3.svg.png.webp","url":"Differentiable_function"}
