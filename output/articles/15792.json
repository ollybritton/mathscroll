{"title":"Time Warp Edit Distance","summary":"Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED) is a measure of similarity (or dissimilarity) for discrete time series matching with time 'elasticity'. In comparison to other distance measures, (e.g. DTW (dynamic time warping) or  LCS (longest common subsequence problem)), TWED is a metric. Its computational time complexity is O ( n 2 ) {\\displaystyle O(n^{2})} , but can be drastically reduced in some specific situations by using a corridor to reduce the search space. Its memory space complexity can be reduced to O ( n ) {\\displaystyle O(n)} . It was first proposed in 2009 by P.-F. Marteau.","image":"6cd9594a16cb898b8f2a2dff9227a385ec183392.svg","url":"Time_Warp_Edit_Distance"}
