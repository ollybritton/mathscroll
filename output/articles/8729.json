{"title":"Kleene's O","summary":"In set theory and computability theory, Kleene's O {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}} is a canonical subset of the natural numbers when regarded as ordinal notations. It contains ordinal notations for every computable ordinal, that is, ordinals below Church–Kleene ordinal, ω 1 CK {\\displaystyle \\omega _{1}^{\\text{CK}}} . Since ω 1 CK {\\displaystyle \\omega _{1}^{\\text{CK}}} is the first ordinal not representable in a computable system of ordinal notations the elements of O {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}} can be regarded as the canonical ordinal notations.","image":"d6ae2ed4058fb748a183d9ada8aea50a00d0c89f.svg","url":"Kleene's_O"}
