{"title":"Continuous-time random walk","summary":"In mathematics, a continuous-time random walk (CTRW) is a generalization of a random walk where the wandering particle waits for a random time between jumps. It is a stochastic jump process with arbitrary distributions of jump lengths and waiting times.[1][2][3] More generally it can be seen to be a special case of a Markov renewal process.","image":"dfeb6663c0a903f587cd6d776c387370fc5c4ab7.svg","url":"Continuous-time_random_walk"}
