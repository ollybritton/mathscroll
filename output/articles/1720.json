{"title":"Bitangents of a quartic","summary":"In the theory of algebraic plane curves, a general quartic plane curve has 28 bitangent lines, lines that are tangent to the curve in two places. These lines exist in the complex projective plane, but it is possible to define quartic curves for which all 28 of these lines have real numbers as their coordinates and therefore belong to the Euclidean plane.","image":"TrottCurveBiTangents7.svg.png.webp","url":"Bitangents_of_a_quartic"}
