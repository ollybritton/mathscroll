{"title":"Lagrange multipliers on Banach spaces","summary":"In the field of calculus of variations in mathematics, the method of Lagrange multipliers on Banach spaces can be used to solve certain infinite-dimensional constrained optimization problems. The method is a generalization of the classical method of Lagrange multipliers as used to find extrema of a function of finitely many variables.","image":"2dfa91e13b355974a51c65defd406875d7be3105.svg","url":"Lagrange_multipliers_on_Banach_spaces"}
