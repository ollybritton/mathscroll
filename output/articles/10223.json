{"title":"Maximum cut","summary":"For a graph, a maximum cut is a cut whose size is at least the size of any other cut. That is, it is a partition of the graph's vertices into two complementary sets S and T, such that the number of edges between S and T is as large as possible. Finding such a cut is known as the max-cut problem.","image":"Max-cut.svg.png.webp","url":"Maximum_cut"}
