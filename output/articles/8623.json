{"title":"Katugampola fractional operators","summary":"In mathematics, Katugampola fractional operators are integral operators that generalize the Riemann–Liouville and the Hadamard fractional operators into a unique form.[1][2][3][4] The Katugampola fractional integral generalizes both the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral and the Hadamard fractional integral into a single form and It is also closely related to the Erdelyi–Kober[5][6][7][8] operator that generalizes the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral. Katugampola fractional derivative[2][3][4] has been defined using the Katugampola fractional integral[3] and as with any other fractional differential operator, it also extends the possibility of taking real number powers or complex number powers of the integral and differential operators.","image":"f2ba58e8c0c28f73415924a35f39860c7d16eb1e.svg","url":"Katugampola_fractional_operators"}
