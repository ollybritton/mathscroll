{"title":"Stable normal bundle","summary":"In surgery theory, a branch of mathematics, the stable normal bundle of a differentiable manifold is an invariant which encodes the stable normal (dually, tangential) data. There are analogs for generalizations of manifold, notably PL-manifolds and topological manifolds. There is also an analogue in homotopy theory for Poincar√© spaces, the Spivak spherical fibration, named after Michael Spivak.[1]","image":"9131024c174205fec3950e75259ee9e7a7f922a7.svg","url":"Stable_normal_bundle"}
