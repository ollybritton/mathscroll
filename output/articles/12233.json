{"title":"Pocket set theory","summary":"Pocket set theory (PST) is an alternative set theory in which there are only two infinite cardinal numbers, â„µ0 (aleph-naught, the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers) and c (the cardinality of the continuum). The theory was first suggested by Rudy Rucker in his Infinity and the Mind.[1] The details set out in this entry are due to the American mathematician Randall M. Holmes.","image":"0432d3c9caff52695b42b6d322805236a1cbea95.svg","url":"Pocket_set_theory"}
