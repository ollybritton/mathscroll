{"title":"Hilbert's fourth problem","summary":"In mathematics, Hilbert's fourth problem in the 1900 list of Hilbert's problems is a foundational question in geometry. In one statement derived from the original, it was to find — up to an isomorphism  — all geometries that have an axiomatic system of the classical geometry (Euclidean, hyperbolic and elliptic), with those axioms of congruence that involve the concept of the angle dropped, and `triangle inequality', regarded as an axiom, added.","image":"Desargues_theorem_alt2.svg.png.webp","url":"Hilbert's_fourth_problem"}
