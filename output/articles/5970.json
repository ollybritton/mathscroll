{"title":"Gauge group (mathematics)","summary":"A gauge group is a group of gauge symmetries of the Yang–Mills gauge theory of principal connections on a principal bundle. Given a principal bundle P → X {\\displaystyle P\\to X} with a structure Lie group G {\\displaystyle G} , a gauge group is defined to be a group of its vertical automorphisms. This group is isomorphic to the group G ( X ) {\\displaystyle G(X)} of global sections of the associated group bundle P ~ → X {\\displaystyle {\\widetilde {P}}\\to X} whose typical fiber is a group G {\\displaystyle G} which acts on itself by the adjoint representation. The unit element of G ( X ) {\\displaystyle G(X)} is a constant unit-valued section g ( x ) = 1 {\\displaystyle g(x)=1} of P ~ → X {\\displaystyle {\\widetilde {P}}\\to X} .","image":"706af59e3c62c6fa253d5f87c0810d24703b99ff.svg","url":"Gauge_group_(mathematics)"}
