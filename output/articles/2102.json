{"title":"C-normal subgroup","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a subgroup H {\\displaystyle H} of a group G {\\displaystyle G} is called c-normal if there is a normal subgroup T {\\displaystyle T} of G {\\displaystyle G} such that H T = G {\\displaystyle HT=G} and the intersection of H {\\displaystyle H} and T {\\displaystyle T} lies inside the normal core of H {\\displaystyle H} .","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"C-normal_subgroup"}
