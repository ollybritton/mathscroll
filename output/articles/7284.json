{"title":"Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, named after Friedrich Hirzebruch, Bernhard Riemann, and Gustav Roch, is Hirzebruch's 1954 result generalizing the classical Riemann–Roch theorem on Riemann surfaces to all complex algebraic varieties of higher dimensions. The result paved the way for the Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem proved about three years later.","image":"c2e2e00faac7e894b39ab6a69c42eb08c5064173.svg","url":"Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch_theorem"}
