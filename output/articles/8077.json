{"title":"Isoperimetric inequality","summary":"In mathematics, the isoperimetric inequality is a geometric inequality involving the perimeter of a set and its volume. In n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} the inequality lower bounds the surface area or perimeter per ⁡ ( S ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {per} (S)} of a set S ⊂ R n {\\displaystyle S\\subset \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} by its volume vol ⁡ ( S ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {vol} (S)} ,","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Isoperimetric_inequality"}
