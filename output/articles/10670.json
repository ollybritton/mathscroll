{"title":"Monotone convergence theorem","summary":"In the mathematical field of real analysis, the monotone convergence theorem is any of a number of related theorems proving the convergence of monotonic sequences (sequences that are non-decreasing or non-increasing) that are also bounded. Informally, the theorems state that if a sequence is increasing and bounded above by a supremum, then the sequence will converge to the supremum; in the same way, if a sequence is decreasing and is bounded below by an infimum, it will converge to the infimum.","image":"70f0c27000fbc03d920b5b678949a0043ad269bd.svg","url":"Monotone_convergence_theorem"}
