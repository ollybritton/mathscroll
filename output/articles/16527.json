{"title":"Veblen function","summary":"In mathematics, the Veblen functions are a hierarchy of normal functions (continuous strictly increasing functions from ordinals to ordinals), introduced by Oswald Veblen in Veblen (1908). If φ0 is any normal function, then for any non-zero ordinal α, φα is the function enumerating the common fixed points of φβ for β<α. These functions are all normal.","image":"1a9ff77845471100a86bd65e0483e5593646ddb8.svg","url":"Veblen_function"}
