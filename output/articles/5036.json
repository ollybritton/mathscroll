{"title":"Euclidean plane isometry","summary":"In geometry, a Euclidean plane isometry is an isometry of the Euclidean plane, or more informally, a way of transforming the plane that preserves geometrical properties such as length. There are four types: translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections (see below under Classification § Notes).","image":"044777a86a0538a8fa59bab43f6222805500f1fe.svg","url":"Euclidean_plane_isometry"}
