{"title":"Dolbeault cohomology","summary":"In mathematics, in particular in algebraic geometry and differential geometry, Dolbeault cohomology (named after Pierre Dolbeault) is an analog of de Rham cohomology for complex manifolds.  Let M be a complex manifold.  Then the Dolbeault cohomology groups H p , q ( M , C ) {\\displaystyle H^{p,q}(M,\\mathbb {C} )} depend on a pair of integers p and q and are realized as a subquotient of the space of complex differential forms of degree (p,q).","image":"9c6007d2519da1621548cf38c40a300273b28841.svg","url":"Dolbeault_cohomology"}
