{"title":"Differential graded module","summary":"In algebra, a differential graded module, or dg-module, is a Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} } -graded module together with a differential; i.e., a square-zero graded endomorphism of the module of degree 1 or âˆ’1, depending on the convention. In other words, it is a chain complex having a structure of a module, while a differential graded algebra is a chain complex with a structure of an algebra.","image":"449494a083e0a1fda2b61c62b2f09b6bee4633dc.svg","url":"Differential_graded_module"}
