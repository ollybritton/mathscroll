{"title":"Quantum cohomology","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in symplectic topology and algebraic geometry, a quantum cohomology ring is an extension of the ordinary cohomology ring of a closed symplectic manifold. It comes in two versions, called small and big; in general, the latter is more complicated and contains more information than the former. In each, the choice of coefficient ring (typically a Novikov ring, described below) significantly affects its structure, as well.","image":"152e2f8984331df7f1937a96bafa1efd8d1d027a.svg","url":"Quantum_cohomology"}
