{"title":"Consistent and inconsistent equations","summary":"In mathematics and particularly in algebra, a system of equations (either linear or nonlinear) is called consistent if there is at least one set of values for the unknowns that satisfies each equation in the systemâ€”that is, when substituted into each of the equations, they make each equation hold true as an identity. In contrast, a linear or non linear equation system is called inconsistent if there is no set of values for the unknowns that satisfies all of the equations.[1][2]","image":"809728d299c73d0c044f1a03396f8aa3c1139890.svg","url":"Consistent_and_inconsistent_equations"}
