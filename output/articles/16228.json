{"title":"Turing reduction","summary":"In computability theory, a Turing reduction from a decision problem A {\\displaystyle A} to a decision problem B {\\displaystyle B} is an oracle machine which decides problem A {\\displaystyle A} given an oracle for B {\\displaystyle B} (Rogers 1967, Soare 1987). It can be understood as an algorithm that could be used to solve A {\\displaystyle A} if it had available to it a subroutine for solving B. The concept can be analogously applied to function problems.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Turing_reduction"}
