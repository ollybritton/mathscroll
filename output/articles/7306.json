{"title":"History of the Theory of Numbers","summary":"History of the Theory of Numbers is a three-volume work by Leonard Eugene Dickson  summarizing work in number theory up to about 1920. The style is unusual in that Dickson mostly just lists results by various authors, with little further discussion. The central topic of quadratic reciprocity and higher reciprocity laws is barely mentioned; this was apparently going to be the topic of a fourth volume that was never written (Fenster 1999).","image":"History_of_the_Theory_of_Numbers_-_titlepage.jpg.webp","url":"History_of_the_Theory_of_Numbers"}
