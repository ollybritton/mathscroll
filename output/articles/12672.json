{"title":"Proportionality (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, two sequences of numbers, often experimental data, are proportional or directly proportional if their corresponding elements have a constant ratio, which is called the coefficient of proportionality or proportionality constant. Two sequences are inversely proportional if corresponding elements have a constant product, also called the coefficient of proportionality.","image":"Proportional_variables.svg.png.webp","url":"Proportionality_(mathematics)"}
