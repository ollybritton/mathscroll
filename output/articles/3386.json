{"title":"Convex drawing","summary":"In graph drawing, a convex drawing of a planar graph is a drawing that represents the vertices of the graph as points in the Euclidean plane and the edges as straight line segments, in such a way that all of the faces of the drawing (including the outer face) have a convex boundary. The boundary of a face may pass straight through one of the vertices of the graph without turning; a strictly convex drawing asks in addition that the face boundary turns at each vertex. That is, in a strictly convex drawing, each vertex of the graph is also a vertex of each convex polygon describing the shape of each incident face.","image":"Convex_and_strictly_convex_grid_drawings.svg.png.webp","url":"Convex_drawing"}
