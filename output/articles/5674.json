{"title":"Frank–Wolfe algorithm","summary":"The Frank–Wolfe algorithm is an iterative first-order optimization algorithm for constrained convex optimization. Also known as the conditional gradient method,[1] reduced gradient algorithm and the convex combination algorithm, the method was originally proposed by Marguerite Frank and Philip Wolfe in 1956.[2] In each iteration, the Frank–Wolfe algorithm considers a linear approximation of the objective function, and moves towards a minimizer of this linear function (taken over the same domain).","image":"3277962e1959c3241fb1b70c7f0ac6dcefebd966.svg","url":"Frank–Wolfe_algorithm"}
