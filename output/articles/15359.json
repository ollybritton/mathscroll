{"title":"Symmetric Boolean function","summary":"In mathematics, a symmetric Boolean function is a Boolean function whose value does not depend on the order of its input bits, i.e., it depends only on the number of ones (or zeros) in the input.[1] For this reason they are also known as Boolean counting functions.[2]","image":"954242e4f79bbd39338477ff9092dbf06acbd39e.svg","url":"Symmetric_Boolean_function"}
