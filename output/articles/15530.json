{"title":"Tau-leaping","summary":"In probability theory, tau-leaping, or Ï„-leaping, is an approximate method for the simulation of a stochastic system.[1] It is based on the Gillespie algorithm, performing all reactions for an interval of length tau before updating the propensity functions.[2] By updating the rates less often this sometimes allows for more efficient simulation and thus the consideration of larger systems.","image":"903549bf0646ac0053196faedfd77df867b615a6.svg","url":"Tau-leaping"}
