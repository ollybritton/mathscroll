{"title":"Rhombohedron","summary":"In geometry, a rhombohedron (also called a rhombic hexahedron[1] or, inaccurately, a rhomboid) is a three-dimensional figure with six faces which are rhombi. It is a special case of a parallelepiped where all edges are the same length. It can be used to define the rhombohedral lattice system, a honeycomb with rhombohedral cells. A cube is a special case of a rhombohedron with all sides square.","image":"Rhombohedron.svg.png.webp","url":"Rhombohedron"}
