{"title":"Multicategory","summary":"In mathematics (especially category theory), a multicategory is a generalization of the concept of category that allows morphisms of multiple arity. If morphisms in a category are viewed as analogous to functions, then morphisms in a multicategory are analogous to functions of several variables. Multicategories are also sometimes called operads, or colored operads.","image":"bd34d14c0c7949a8377b25f0b3ddc49aad21aa17.svg","url":"Multicategory"}
