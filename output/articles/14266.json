{"title":"Sharp QT-8D","summary":"The Sharp QT-8D Micro Compet, a small electronic desktop calculator, was the first mass-produced calculator to have its logic circuitry entirely implemented with LSI (large-scale integration) integrated circuits (ICs) based on MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology.[1][note 1] When it was introduced in late 1969,[3] it was one of the smallest electronic calculators ever produced commercially. Previous electronic calculators had been about the size of a typewriter and had logic circuits built from numerous discrete transistors and diodes or small- to medium-scale ICs.[1] The QT-8D's logic circuits were packed into just four LSI ICs.[3]","image":"Sharp_QT-8D_Micro_Compet_front_view.jpg.webp","url":"Sharp_QT-8D"}
