{"title":"Real analytic Eisenstein series","summary":"In mathematics, the simplest real analytic Eisenstein series is a special function of two variables. It is used in the representation theory of SL(2,R) and in analytic number theory. It is closely related to the Epstein zeta function.","image":"71d36ce18ec045049cb648da470c02f081907557.svg","url":"Real_analytic_Eisenstein_series"}
