{"title":"Pseudospectrum","summary":"In mathematics, the pseudospectrum of an operator is a set containing the spectrum of the operator and the numbers that are \"almost\" eigenvalues. Knowledge of the pseudospectrum can be particularly useful for understanding non-normal operators and their eigenfunctions.","image":"aa5c5e3e6e19c3feadce7e8d5f04809c28224290.svg","url":"Pseudospectrum"}
