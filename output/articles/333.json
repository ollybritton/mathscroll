{"title":"Activity selection problem","summary":"The activity selection problem  is a combinatorial optimization problem concerning the selection of non-conflicting activities to perform within a given time frame, given a set of activities each marked by a start time (si) and finish time (fi). The problem is to select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person or machine, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time. The activity selection problem is also known as the Interval scheduling maximization problem (ISMP), which is a special type of the more general Interval Scheduling problem.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Activity_selection_problem"}
