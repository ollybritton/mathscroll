{"title":"Compound matrix","summary":"In linear algebra, a branch of mathematics, a (multiplicative) compound matrix is a matrix whose entries are all minors, of a given size, of another matrix.[1][2][3][4] Compound matrices are closely related to exterior algebras,[5] and their computation appears in a wide array of problems, such as in the analysis of nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and generalizations of positive systems, cooperative systems and contracting systems.[4][6]","image":"2d06bef711062dd9ff59efde1d65fc0a083bc754.svg","url":"Compound_matrix"}
