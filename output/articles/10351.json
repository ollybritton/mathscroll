{"title":"Metaplectic structure","summary":"In differential geometry, a metaplectic structure is the symplectic analog of spin structure on orientable Riemannian manifolds. A metaplectic structure on a symplectic manifold allows one to define the symplectic spinor bundle, which is the Hilbert space bundle associated to the metaplectic structure via the metaplectic representation, giving rise to the notion of a symplectic spinor field in differential geometry.","image":"d343da33a65bc6b0682b8da9ba31e5af966ce9eb.svg","url":"Metaplectic_structure"}
