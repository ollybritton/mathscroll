{"title":"Semi-continuity","summary":"In mathematical analysis, semicontinuity (or semi-continuity) is a property of extended real-valued functions that is weaker than continuity. An extended real-valued function f {\\displaystyle f} is upper (respectively, lower) semicontinuous at a point x 0 {\\displaystyle x_{0}} if, roughly speaking, the function values for arguments near x 0 {\\displaystyle x_{0}} are not much higher (respectively, lower) than f ( x 0 ) . {\\displaystyle f\\left(x_{0}\\right).}","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Semi-continuity"}
