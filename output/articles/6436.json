{"title":"Gram matrix","summary":"In linear algebra, the Gram matrix (or Gramian matrix, Gramian) of a set of vectors v 1 , … , v n {\\displaystyle v_{1},\\dots ,v_{n}} in an inner product space is the Hermitian matrix of inner products, whose entries are given by the inner product G i j = ⟨ v i , v j ⟩ {\\displaystyle G_{ij}=\\left\\langle v_{i},v_{j}\\right\\rangle } .[1] If the vectors v 1 , … , v n {\\displaystyle v_{1},\\dots ,v_{n}} are the columns of matrix X {\\displaystyle X} then the Gram matrix is X ∗ X {\\displaystyle X^{*}X} in the general case that the vector coordinates are complex numbers, which simplifies to X ⊤ X {\\displaystyle X^{\\top }X} for the case that the vector coordinates are real numbers.","image":"3e6ddc943290a5e10aa10a064fb4d6a745f0fde7.svg","url":"Gram_matrix"}
