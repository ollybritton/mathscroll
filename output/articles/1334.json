{"title":"Barrier function","summary":"In constrained optimization, a field of mathematics,  a barrier function is a continuous function whose value on a point increases to infinity as the point approaches the boundary of the feasible region of an optimization problem.[1][2] Such functions are used to replace inequality constraints by a penalizing term in the objective function that is easier to handle.","image":"35e5b9ecbea578e3d3a768d015177fe80f6da87e.svg","url":"Barrier_function"}
