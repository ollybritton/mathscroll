{"title":"Binomial sum variance inequality","summary":"The binomial sum variance inequality states that the variance of the sum of binomially distributed random variables will always be less than or equal to the variance of a binomial variable with the same n and p parameters. In probability theory and statistics, the sum of independent binomial random variables is itself a binomial random variable if all the component variables share the same success probability. If success probabilities differ, the probability distribution of the sum is not binomial.[1] The lack of uniformity in success probabilities across independent trials leads to a smaller variance.[2][3][4][5][6] and is a special case of a more general theorem involving the expected value of convex functions.[7] In some statistical applications, the standard binomial variance estimator can be used even if the component probabilities differ, though with a variance estimate that has an upward bias.","image":"09729e8b5da4b122b91991527ccff313a7f3ae7e.svg","url":"Binomial_sum_variance_inequality"}
