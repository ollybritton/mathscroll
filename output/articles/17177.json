{"title":"Ziegler spectrum","summary":"In mathematics, the (right) Ziegler spectrum of a ring R is a topological space whose points are (isomorphism classes of) indecomposable pure-injective right R-modules. Its closed subsets correspond to theories of modules closed under arbitrary products and direct summands. Ziegler spectra are named after Martin Ziegler, who first defined and studied them in 1984.[1]","image":"488fc150b45ef224b05cbc6568fd5c039c2f7a14.svg","url":"Ziegler_spectrum"}
