{"title":"Alternating sign matrix","summary":"In mathematics, an alternating sign matrix is a square matrix of 0s, 1s, and âˆ’1s such that the sum of each row and column is 1 and the nonzero entries in each row and column alternate in sign. These matrices generalize permutation matrices and arise naturally when using Dodgson condensation to compute a determinant. They are also closely related to the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions from statistical mechanics. They were first defined by William Mills, David Robbins, and Howard Rumsey in the former context.","image":"056af795ca73c37ca500b9c68b9aa24685426e0e.svg","url":"Alternating_sign_matrix"}
