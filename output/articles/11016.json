{"title":"Network simplex algorithm","summary":"In mathematical optimization, the network simplex algorithm is a graph theoretic specialization of the simplex algorithm. The algorithm is usually formulated in terms of a minimum-cost flow problem. The network simplex method works very well in practice, typically 200 to 300 times faster than the simplex method applied to general linear program of same dimensions.","image":"645e86efa48245ea0e6b05f0218f5305e86171b3.svg","url":"Network_simplex_algorithm"}
