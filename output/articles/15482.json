{"title":"Tammes problem","summary":"In geometry, the Tammes problem is a problem in packing a given number of circles on the surface of a sphere such that the minimum distance between circles is maximized.  It is named after the Dutch botanist Pieter Merkus Lambertus Tammes (the nephew of pioneering botanist Jantina Tammes) who posed the problem in his 1930 doctoral dissertation on the distribution of pores on pollen grains.[1] Mathematicians independent of Tammes began studying circle packing on the sphere in the early 1940s; it was not until twenty years later that the problem became associated with his name.","image":"Coral_Sphere_Flynn_Reef.jpg.webp","url":"Tammes_problem"}
