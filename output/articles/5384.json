{"title":"Fibered knot","summary":"In knot theory, a branch of mathematics, a knot or link K {\\displaystyle K} in the 3-dimensional sphere S 3 {\\displaystyle S^{3}} is called fibered or fibred (sometimes Neuwirth knot in older texts, after Lee Neuwirth) if there is a 1-parameter family F t {\\displaystyle F_{t}} of Seifert surfaces for K {\\displaystyle K} , where the parameter t {\\displaystyle t} runs through the points of the unit circle S 1 {\\displaystyle S^{1}} , such that if s {\\displaystyle s} is not equal to t {\\displaystyle t} then the intersection of F s {\\displaystyle F_{s}} and F t {\\displaystyle F_{t}} is exactly K {\\displaystyle K} .","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Fibered_knot"}
