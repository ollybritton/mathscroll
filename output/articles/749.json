{"title":"Analytic semigroup","summary":"In mathematics, an analytic semigroup is particular kind of strongly continuous semigroup.  Analytic semigroups are used in the solution of partial differential equations; compared to strongly continuous semigroups, analytic semigroups provide better regularity of solutions to initial value problems, better results concerning perturbations of the infinitesimal generator, and a relationship between the type of the semigroup and the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator.","image":"498d7349da2e0bc2e3204bc1ee6899af39660a5c.svg","url":"Analytic_semigroup"}
