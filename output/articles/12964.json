{"title":"Quaternions and spatial rotation","summary":"Unit quaternions, known as versors, provide a convenient mathematical notation for representing spatial orientations and rotations of elements in three dimensional space. Specifically, they encode information about an axis-angle rotation about an arbitrary axis. Rotation and orientation quaternions have applications in computer graphics,[1] computer vision, robotics,[2] navigation, molecular dynamics, flight dynamics,[3] orbital mechanics of satellites,[4] and crystallographic texture analysis.[5]","image":"6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af.svg","url":"Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation"}
