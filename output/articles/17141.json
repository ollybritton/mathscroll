{"title":"Zermelo's navigation problem","summary":"In mathematical optimization, Zermelo's navigation problem, proposed in 1931 by Ernst Zermelo, is a classic optimal control problem that deals with a boat navigating on a body of water, originating from a point A {\\displaystyle A} to a destination point B {\\displaystyle B} . The boat is capable of a certain maximum speed, and the goal is to derive the best possible control to reach B {\\displaystyle B} in the least possible time.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Zermelo's_navigation_problem"}
