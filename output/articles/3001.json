{"title":"Complex Wishart distribution","summary":"In statistics, the complex Wishart distribution is a complex version of the Wishart distribution.  It is the distribution of n {\\displaystyle n} times the sample Hermitian covariance matrix of n {\\displaystyle n} zero-mean independent Gaussian random variables.  It has support for p Ã— p {\\displaystyle p\\times p} Hermitian positive definite matrices.[1]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Complex_Wishart_distribution"}
