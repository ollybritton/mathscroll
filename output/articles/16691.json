{"title":"Von Neumann universal constructor","summary":"John von Neumann's universal constructor is a self-replicating machine in a cellular automaton (CA) environment. It was designed in the 1940s, without the use of a computer. The fundamental details of the machine were published in von Neumann's book Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata, completed in 1966 by Arthur W. Burks after von Neumann's death.[2] While typically not as well known as von Neumann's other work, it is regarded as foundational for automata theory, complex systems, and artificial life.[3][4] Indeed, Nobel Laureate Sydney Brenner considered Von Neumann's work on self-reproducing automata (together with Turing's work on computing machines) central to biological theory as well, allowing us to \"discipline our thoughts about machines, both natural and artificial.\"[5]","image":"Nobili_Pesavento_2reps.png.webp","url":"Von_Neumann_universal_constructor"}
