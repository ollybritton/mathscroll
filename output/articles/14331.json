{"title":"Siegel modular variety","summary":"In mathematics, a Siegel modular variety or Siegel moduli space is an algebraic variety that parametrizes certain types of abelian varieties of a fixed dimension. More precisely, Siegel modular varieties are the moduli spaces of principally polarized abelian varieties of a fixed dimension. They are named after Carl Ludwig Siegel, the 20th-century German number theorist who introduced the varieties in 1943.[2][3]","image":"CalabiYau5.jpg.webp","url":"Siegel_modular_variety"}
