{"title":"Hermitian Yang–Mills connection","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular gauge theory and complex geometry, a Hermitian Yang–Mills connection (or Hermite-Einstein connection) is a Chern connection associated to an inner product on a holomorphic vector bundle over a Kähler manifold that satisfies an analogue of Einstein's equations: namely, the contraction of the curvature 2-form of the connection with the Kähler form is required to be a constant times the identity transformation. Hermitian Yang–Mills connections are special examples of Yang–Mills connections, and are often called instantons.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Hermitian_Yang–Mills_connection"}
