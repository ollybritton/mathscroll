{"title":"Mrs. Miniver's problem","summary":"Mrs. Miniver's problem is a geometry problem about the area of circles. It asks how to place two circles A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} of given radii in such a way that the lens formed by intersecting their two interiors has equal area to the symmetric difference of A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} (the area contained in one but not both circles).[1] It was named for an analogy between geometry and social dynamics enunciated by fictional character Mrs. Miniver, who \"saw every relationship as a pair of intersecting circles\". Its solution involves a transcendental equation.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Mrs._Miniver's_problem"}
