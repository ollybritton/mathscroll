{"title":"Contact type","summary":"In mathematics, more precisely in symplectic geometry, a hypersurface Σ {\\displaystyle \\Sigma } of a symplectic manifold ( M , ω ) {\\displaystyle (M,\\omega )} is said to be of contact type if there is 1-form α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } such that j ∗ ( ω ) = d α {\\displaystyle j^{*}(\\omega )=d\\alpha } and ( Σ , α ) {\\displaystyle (\\Sigma ,\\alpha )} is a contact manifold, where j : Σ → M {\\displaystyle j:\\Sigma \\to M} is the natural inclusion.[1] The terminology was first coined by Alan Weinstein.","image":"9e1f558f53cda207614abdf90162266c70bc5c1e.svg","url":"Contact_type"}
