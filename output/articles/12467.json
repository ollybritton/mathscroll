{"title":"Presheaf (category theory)","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a presheaf on a category C {\\displaystyle C} is a functor F : C o p â†’ S e t {\\displaystyle F\\colon C^{\\mathrm {op} }\\to \\mathbf {Set} } . If C {\\displaystyle C} is the poset of open sets in a topological space, interpreted as a category, then one recovers the usual notion of presheaf on a topological space.","image":"4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029.svg","url":"Presheaf_(category_theory)"}
