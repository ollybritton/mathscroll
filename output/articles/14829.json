{"title":"Split Lie algebra","summary":"In the mathematical field of Lie theory, a split Lie algebra is a pair ( g , h ) {\\displaystyle ({\\mathfrak {g}},{\\mathfrak {h}})} where g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} is a Lie algebra and h < g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {h}}<{\\mathfrak {g}}} is a splitting Cartan subalgebra, where \"splitting\" means that for all x ∈ h {\\displaystyle x\\in {\\mathfrak {h}}} , ad g ⁡ x {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {ad} _{\\mathfrak {g}}x} is triangularizable. If a Lie algebra admits a splitting, it is called a splittable Lie algebra.[1] Note that for reductive Lie algebras, the Cartan subalgebra is required to contain the center.","image":"6120c7e5c1316df191e249f97a73377b9379ea99.svg","url":"Split_Lie_algebra"}
