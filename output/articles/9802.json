{"title":"Lévy–Prokhorov metric","summary":"In mathematics, the Lévy–Prokhorov metric (sometimes known just as the Prokhorov metric) is a metric (i.e., a definition of distance) on the collection of probability measures on a given metric space. It is named after the French mathematician Paul Lévy and the Soviet mathematician Yuri Vasilyevich Prokhorov; Prokhorov introduced it in 1956 as a generalization of the earlier Lévy metric.","image":"d78e6f2ddf5baee227ee2a9f164726ba0c23c263.svg","url":"Lévy–Prokhorov_metric"}
