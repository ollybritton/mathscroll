{"title":"Graph coloring","summary":"In graph theory, graph coloring is a special case of graph labeling; it is an assignment of labels traditionally called \"colors\" to elements of a graph subject to certain constraints. In its simplest form, it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are of the same color; this is called a vertex coloring. Similarly, an edge coloring assigns a color to each edge so that no two adjacent edges are of the same color, and a face coloring of a planar graph assigns a color to each face or region so that no two faces that share a boundary have the same color.","image":"Petersen_graph_3-coloring.svg.png.webp","url":"Graph_coloring"}
