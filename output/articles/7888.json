{"title":"Integration along fibers","summary":"In differential geometry, the integration along fibers of a k-form yields a ( k âˆ’ m ) {\\displaystyle (k-m)} -form where m is the dimension of the fiber, via \"integration\". It is also called the fiber integration.","image":"18ab8684603feeeaa0709c4b3cae76a7338e91b7.svg","url":"Integration_along_fibers"}
