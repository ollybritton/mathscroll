{"title":"Project Euler","summary":"Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.[1][2] The project attracts graduates and students interested in mathematics and computer programming.  Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.[3] It includes over 830 problems as of 23 March 2023,[4] with a new one added approximately every week.[5] Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.[6] As of 23 March 2023, Project Euler has close to 1,040,000 users who have solved at least one problem, in over 100 different programming languages, from about 220 locations around the world.[6]","image":"Leonhard_Euler.jpg.webp","url":"Project_Euler"}
