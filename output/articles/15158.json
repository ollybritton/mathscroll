{"title":"Structurable algebra","summary":"In abstract algebra, a structurable algebra is a certain kind of unital involutive non-associative algebra over a field. For example, all Jordan algebras are structurable algebras (with the trivial involution), as is any alternative algebra with involution, or any central simple algebra with involution. An involution here means a linear anti-homomorphism whose square is the identity.[1]","image":"768bb2cd6a469ca6789c92ab7e9c448fd2321ab2.svg","url":"Structurable_algebra"}
