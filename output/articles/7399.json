{"title":"Hook length formula","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, the hook length formula is a formula for the number of standard Young tableaux whose shape is a given Young diagram. It has applications in diverse areas such as representation theory, probability, and algorithm analysis; for example, the problem of longest increasing subsequences. A related formula gives the number of semi-standard Young tableaux, which is a specialization of a Schur polynomial.","image":"73bc6d8ed471ae2b09bb25bd63b89f04dd6de1c6.svg","url":"Hook_length_formula"}
