{"title":"Double coset","summary":"In group theory, a field of mathematics, a double coset is a collection of group elements which are equivalent under the symmetries coming from two subgroups.[1][2]  More precisely, let G be a group, and let H and K be subgroups.  Let H act on G by left multiplication and let K act on G by right multiplication.  For each x in G, the (H, K)-double coset of x is the set","image":"33e8db93a4785947cf61105e66234ab3f20c663f.svg","url":"Double_coset"}
