{"title":"Truncated order-4 octagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the truncated order-4 octagonal tiling is a uniform tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It has Schl√§fli symbol of t0,1{8,4}.  A secondary construction t0,1,2{8,8} is called a truncated octaoctagonal tiling with two colors of hexakaidecagons.","image":"H2_tiling_248-3.png.webp","url":"Truncated_order-4_octagonal_tiling"}
