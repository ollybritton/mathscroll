{"title":"Cayley graph","summary":"In mathematics, a Cayley graph, also known as a Cayley color graph, Cayley diagram, group diagram, or color group[1] is a graph that encodes the abstract structure of a group. Its definition is suggested by Cayley's theorem (named after Arthur Cayley), and uses a specified set of generators for the group. It is a central tool in combinatorial and geometric group theory. The structure and symmetry of Cayley graphs makes them particularly good candidates for constructing families of expander graphs.","image":"Cayley_graph_of_F2.svg.png.webp","url":"Cayley_graph"}
