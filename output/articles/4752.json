{"title":"Elliptic cylindrical coordinates","summary":"Elliptic cylindrical coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from projecting the two-dimensional elliptic coordinate system in the perpendicular z {\\displaystyle z} -direction.  Hence, the coordinate surfaces are prisms of confocal ellipses and hyperbolae.  The two foci F 1 {\\displaystyle F_{1}} and F 2 {\\displaystyle F_{2}} are generally taken to be fixed at âˆ’ a {\\displaystyle -a} and + a {\\displaystyle +a} , respectively, on the x {\\displaystyle x} -axis of the Cartesian coordinate system.","image":"bf368e72c009decd9b6686ee84a375632e11de98.svg","url":"Elliptic_cylindrical_coordinates"}
