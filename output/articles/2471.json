{"title":"Chang's conjecture","summary":"In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, Chang's conjecture, attributed to Chen Chung Chang by Vaught (1963, p. 309), states that every model of type (ω2,ω1) for a countable language has an elementary submodel of type (ω1, ω). A model is of type (α,β) if it is of cardinality α and a unary relation is represented by a subset of cardinality β. The usual notation is ( ω 2 , ω 1 ) ↠ ( ω 1 , ω ) {\\displaystyle (\\omega _{2},\\omega _{1})\\twoheadrightarrow (\\omega _{1},\\omega )} .","image":"bfa1dff818fd65612717b6fb07b5af7d7b597593.svg","url":"Chang's_conjecture"}
