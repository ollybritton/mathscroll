{"title":"n-flake","summary":"An n-flake, polyflake, or Sierpinski n-gon,[1]: 1  is a fractal constructed starting from an n-gon. This n-gon is replaced by a flake of smaller n-gons, such that the scaled polygons are placed at the vertices, and sometimes in the center. This process is repeated recursively to result in the fractal. Typically, there is also the restriction that the n-gons must touch yet not overlap.","image":"a955b2676cdc5a1177d638bdd96b5d0de0780cdf.svg","url":"N-flake"}
