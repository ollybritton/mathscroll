{"title":"Schaefer's dichotomy theorem","summary":"In computational complexity theory, a branch of computer science, Schaefer's dichotomy theorem states necessary and sufficient conditions under which a finite set S of relations over the Boolean domain yields polynomial-time or NP-complete problems when the relations of S are used to constrain some of the propositional variables.[1] It is called a dichotomy theorem because the complexity of the problem defined by S is either in P or NP-complete as opposed to one of the classes of intermediate complexity that is known to exist (assuming P â‰  NP) by Ladner's theorem.","image":"768d9ba5b131a0366805a100331f8ec390f428ae.svg","url":"Schaefer's_dichotomy_theorem"}
