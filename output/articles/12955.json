{"title":"Quaternion-Kähler symmetric space","summary":"In differential geometry, a quaternion-Kähler symmetric space or Wolf space is a quaternion-Kähler manifold which, as a Riemannian manifold, is a Riemannian symmetric space. Any quaternion-Kähler symmetric space with positive Ricci curvature is compact and simply connected, and is a Riemannian product of quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces associated to compact simple Lie groups.","image":"2e987168e9e56e53d6d08ee938740f9daa6b0f3c.svg","url":"Quaternion-Kähler_symmetric_space"}
