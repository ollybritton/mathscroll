{"title":"Two-step M-estimator","summary":"Two-step M-estimators deals with M-estimation problems that require preliminary estimation to obtain the parameter of interest. Two-step M-estimation is different from usual M-estimation problem because asymptotic distribution of the second-step estimator generally depends on the first-step estimator.  Accounting for this change in asymptotic distribution is important for valid inference.","image":"9a3cdb1999b1c0ff5ba0f657770759f1c7361cec.svg","url":"Two-step_M-estimator"}
