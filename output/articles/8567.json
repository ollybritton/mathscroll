{"title":"Kaleidocycle","summary":"A kaleidocycle or flextangle is a flexible polyhedron connecting six tetrahedra (or disphenoids) on opposite edges into a cycle. If the faces of the disphenoids are equilateral triangles, it can be constructed from a stretched triangular tiling net with four triangles in one direction and an even number in the other direction.","image":"Kaleidocycle6-limiting-case-blue-double-edges.gif","url":"Kaleidocycle"}
