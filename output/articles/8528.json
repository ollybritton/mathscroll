{"title":"k-medoids","summary":"The k-medoids problem is a clustering problem similar to k-means. The name was coined by Leonard Kaufman and Peter J. Rousseeuw with their PAM algorithm.[1] Both the k-means and k-medoids algorithms are partitional (breaking the dataset up into groups) and attempt to minimize the distance between points labeled to be in a cluster and a point designated as the center of that cluster. In contrast to the k-means algorithm, k-medoids chooses actual data points as centers (medoids or exemplars), and thereby allows for greater interpretability of the cluster centers than in k-means, where the center of a cluster is not necessarily one of the input data points (it is the average between the points in the cluster). Furthermore, k-medoids can be used with arbitrary dissimilarity measures, whereas k-means generally requires Euclidean distance for efficient solutions. Because k-medoids minimizes a sum of pairwise dissimilarities instead of a sum of squared Euclidean distances, it is more robust to noise and outliers than k-means.","image":"K-Medoids_Clustering.gif","url":"K-medoids"}
