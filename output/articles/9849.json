{"title":"Magic graph","summary":"A magic graph is a graph whose edges are labelled by  the first q positive integers, where q is the number of edges, so that the sum over the edges incident with any vertex is the same, independent of the choice of vertex; or it is a graph that has such a labelling.  The name \"magic\" sometimes means that the integers are any positive integers; then the graph and the labelling using the first q positive integers are called supermagic.","image":"4x4_magic_square_hierarchy.svg.png.webp","url":"Magic_graph"}
