{"title":"Saturated set","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in the subfields of set theory and topology, a set C {\\displaystyle C} is said to be saturated with respect to a function f : X → Y {\\displaystyle f:X\\to Y} if C {\\displaystyle C} is a subset of f {\\displaystyle f} 's domain X {\\displaystyle X} and if whenever f {\\displaystyle f} sends two points c ∈ C {\\displaystyle c\\in C} and x ∈ X {\\displaystyle x\\in X} to the same value then x {\\displaystyle x} belongs to C {\\displaystyle C} (that is, if f ( x ) = f ( c ) {\\displaystyle f(x)=f(c)} then x ∈ C {\\displaystyle x\\in C} ). Said more succinctly, the set C {\\displaystyle C} is called saturated if C = f − 1 ( f ( C ) ) . {\\displaystyle C=f^{-1}(f(C)).}","image":"4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029.svg","url":"Saturated_set"}
