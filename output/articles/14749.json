{"title":"Spectral signal-to-noise ratio","summary":"In scientific imaging, the two-dimensional spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) is a signal-to-noise ratio measure which measures the normalised cross-correlation coefficient between several two-dimensional images over corresponding rings in Fourier space as a function of spatial frequency (Unser, Trus & Steven 1987). It is a multi-particle extension of the Fourier ring correlation (FRC), which is related to the Fourier shell correlation. The SSNR is a popular method for finding the resolution of a class average in cryo-electron microscopy.","image":"9ec21934b9c6f3557867689729917bb8945c1f0c.svg","url":"Spectral_signal-to-noise_ratio"}
