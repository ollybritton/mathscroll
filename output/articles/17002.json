{"title":"Witt algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the complex  Witt algebra, named after Ernst Witt, is the Lie algebra of meromorphic vector fields defined on the Riemann sphere that are holomorphic except at two fixed points.  It is also the complexification of the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields on a circle, and the Lie algebra of derivations of the ring C[z,zâˆ’1].","image":"3e880289321ff9dbff41e843922fc9d5b3adf00f.svg","url":"Witt_algebra"}
