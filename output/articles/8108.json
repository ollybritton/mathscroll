{"title":"Iterative deepening depth-first search","summary":"In computer science, iterative deepening search or more specifically iterative deepening depth-first search[2] (IDS or IDDFS) is a state space/graph search strategy in which a depth-limited version of depth-first search is run repeatedly with increasing depth limits until the goal is found.  IDDFS is optimal like breadth-first search, but uses much less memory; at each iteration, it visits the nodes in the search tree in the same order as depth-first search, but the cumulative order in which nodes are first visited is effectively breadth-first.[1]","image":"c99d691c81f015266d1626ef381d2a1a49466fbb.svg","url":"Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search"}
