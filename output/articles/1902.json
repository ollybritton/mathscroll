{"title":"Bouquet graph","summary":"In mathematics, a bouquet graph B m {\\displaystyle B_{m}} , for an integer parameter m {\\displaystyle m} , is an undirected graph with one vertex and m {\\displaystyle m} edges, all of which are self-loops. It is the graph-theoretic analogue of the topological bouquet, a space of m {\\displaystyle m} circles joined at a point. When the context of graph theory is clear, it can be called more simply a bouquet.[1]","image":"a456541580ea1bf26b1e331ff3c2d7a71425c069.svg","url":"Bouquet_graph"}
