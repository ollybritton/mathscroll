{"title":"Slater integrals","summary":"In mathematics and mathematical physics, Slater integrals are certain integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. They occur naturally when applying an orthonormal basis of functions on the unit sphere that transform in a particular way under rotations in three dimensions. Such integrals are particularly useful when computing properties of atoms which have natural spherical symmetry. These integrals are defined below along with some of their mathematical properties.","image":"86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455.svg","url":"Slater_integrals"}
