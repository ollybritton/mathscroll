{"title":"Taylor's theorem","summary":"In calculus, Taylor's theorem gives an approximation of a k {\\textstyle k} -times differentiable function around a given point by a polynomial of degree k {\\textstyle k} , called the k {\\textstyle k} -th-order Taylor polynomial. For a smooth function, the Taylor polynomial is the truncation at the order k {\\textstyle k} of the Taylor series of the function. The first-order Taylor polynomial is the linear approximation of the function, and the second-order Taylor polynomial is often referred to as the quadratic approximation.[1] There are several versions of Taylor's theorem, some giving explicit estimates of the approximation error of the function by its Taylor polynomial.","image":"0d5595fc0c47452f8fc2aa6e29c3611f047714b0.svg","url":"Taylor's_theorem"}
