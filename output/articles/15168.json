{"title":"Structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of abstract algebra, the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain is a generalization of the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups and roughly states that finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain (PID) can be uniquely decomposed in much the same way that integers have a prime factorization.  The result provides a simple framework to understand various canonical form results for square matrices over fields.","image":"919dec14f2986ff357d6512ee0cf106b69fc04f1.svg","url":"Structure_theorem_for_finitely_generated_modules_over_a_principal_ideal_domain"}
