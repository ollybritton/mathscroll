{"title":"Rencontres numbers","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, the rencontres numbers are a triangular array of integers that enumerate permutations of the set { 1, ..., n } with specified numbers of fixed points: in other words, partial derangements.  (Rencontre is French for encounter.  By some accounts, the problem is named after a solitaire game.)  For n ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the rencontres number Dn, k is the number of permutations of { 1, ..., n } that have exactly k fixed points.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Rencontres_numbers"}
