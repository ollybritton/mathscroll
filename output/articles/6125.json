{"title":"Geodesics on an ellipsoid","summary":"The study of geodesics on an ellipsoid arose in connection with geodesy specifically with the solution of triangulation networks.  The figure of the Earth is well approximated by an oblate ellipsoid, a slightly flattened sphere.  A geodesic is the shortest path between two points on a curved surface, analogous to a straight line on a plane surface.  The solution of a triangulation network on an ellipsoid is therefore a set of exercises in spheroidal trigonometry (Euler 1755).","image":"Azimutalprojektion-schief_kl-cropped.png.webp","url":"Geodesics_on_an_ellipsoid"}
