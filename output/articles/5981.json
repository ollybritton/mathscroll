{"title":"Gauss map","summary":"In differential geometry, the Gauss map (named after Carl F. Gauss) maps a surface in Euclidean space R3 to the unit sphere S2. Namely, given a surface X lying in R3, the Gauss map is a continuous map N: X â†’ S2 such that  N(p) is a unit vector orthogonal to X at p, namely a normal vector to X at p.","image":"Gauss_map.svg.png.webp","url":"Gauss_map"}
