{"title":"Dominator (graph theory)","summary":"In computer science, a node d of a control-flow graph dominates a node n if every path from the entry node to n must go through d. Notationally, this is written as d dom n (or sometimes d â‰« n). By definition, every node dominates itself.","image":"Dominator_control_flow_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Dominator_(graph_theory)"}
