{"title":"Stieltjes matrix","summary":"In mathematics, particularly matrix theory, a Stieltjes matrix, named after Thomas Joannes Stieltjes, is a real  symmetric positive definite matrix with nonpositive off-diagonal entries.  A Stieltjes matrix is necessarily an M-matrix.  Every n×n Stieltjes matrix is invertible to a nonsingular symmetric nonnegative matrix, though the converse of this statement is not true in general for n > 2.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Stieltjes_matrix"}
