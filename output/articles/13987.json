{"title":"Schur orthogonality relations","summary":"In mathematics, the Schur orthogonality relations, which were proven by Issai Schur through Schur's lemma, express a central fact about representations of finite groups. They admit a generalization to the case of compact groups in general, and in particular compact Lie groups, such as the rotation group SO(3).","image":"c9bc502b72d04fb0fdb55c2cbf3eba4a10b27b43.svg","url":"Schur_orthogonality_relations"}
