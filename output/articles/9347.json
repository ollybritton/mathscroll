{"title":"Linear approximation","summary":"In mathematics, a linear approximation is an approximation of a general function using a linear function (more precisely, an affine function). They are widely used in the method of finite differences to produce first order methods for solving or approximating solutions to equations.","image":"TangentGraphic2.svg.png.webp","url":"Linear_approximation"}
