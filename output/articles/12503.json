{"title":"Primitive polynomial (field theory)","summary":"In finite field theory, a branch of mathematics, a primitive polynomial is the minimal polynomial of a primitive element of the finite field GF(pm). This means that a polynomial F(X) of degree m with coefficients in GF(p) = Z/pZ is a primitive polynomial if it is monic and has a root α in GF(pm) such that { 0 , 1 , α , α 2 , α 3 , … α p m − 1 } {\\displaystyle \\{0,1,\\alpha ,\\alpha ^{2},\\alpha ^{3},\\ldots \\alpha ^{p^{m}-1}\\}} is the entire field GF(pm). This implies that α is a primitive (pm − 1)-root of unity in GF(pm).","image":"ce91fd4763406a99273c554d98969a896bfb2c79.svg","url":"Primitive_polynomial_(field_theory)"}
