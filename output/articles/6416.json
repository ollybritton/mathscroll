{"title":"Gradient","summary":"In vector calculus, the gradient of a scalar-valued differentiable function f {\\displaystyle f} of several variables is the vector field (or vector-valued function) âˆ‡ f {\\displaystyle \\nabla f} whose value at a point p {\\displaystyle p} is the \"direction and rate of fastest increase\". If the gradient of a function is non-zero at a point p {\\displaystyle p} , the direction of the gradient is the direction in which the function increases most quickly from p {\\displaystyle p} , and the magnitude of the gradient is the rate of increase in that direction, the greatest absolute directional derivative.[1] Further, a point where the gradient is the zero vector is known as a stationary point. The gradient thus plays a fundamental role in optimization theory, where it is used to maximize a function by gradient ascent. In coordinate-free terms, the gradient of a function f ( r ) {\\displaystyle f(\\mathbf {r} )} may be defined by:","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Gradient"}
