{"title":"Schur–Weyl duality","summary":"Schur–Weyl duality is a mathematical theorem in representation theory that relates irreducible finite-dimensional representations of the general linear and symmetric groups. It is named after two pioneers of representation theory of Lie groups, Issai Schur, who discovered the phenomenon, and Hermann Weyl, who popularized it in his books on quantum mechanics and classical groups as a way of classifying representations of unitary and general linear groups.","image":"ff53198a70dcbb8860b9d6ffe383008613be091e.svg","url":"Schur–Weyl_duality"}
