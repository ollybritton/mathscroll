{"title":"Trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron or rhombo-trapezoidal dodecahedron is a convex dodecahedron with 6 rhombic and 6 trapezoidal faces. It has D3h symmetry. A concave form can be constructed with an identical net, seen as excavating trigonal trapezohedra from the top and bottom. It is also called the trapezoidal dodecahedron.[1]","image":"Trapezo-rhombic_dodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Trapezo-rhombic_dodecahedron"}
