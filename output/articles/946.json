{"title":"Archimedean solid","summary":"In geometry, an Archimedean solid is one of the 13 solids first enumerated by Archimedes.  They are the convex uniform polyhedra composed of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices, excluding the five Platonic solids (which are composed of only one type of polygon), excluding the prisms and antiprisms, and excluding the pseudorhombicuboctahedron.[1] They are a subset of the Johnson solids, whose regular polygonal faces do not need to meet in identical vertices.","image":"Polyhedron_truncated_4a_max.png.webp","url":"Archimedean_solid"}
