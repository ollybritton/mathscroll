{"title":"Dowling geometry","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, a Dowling geometry, named after Thomas A. Dowling, is a matroid associated with a group. There is a Dowling geometry of each rank for each group. If the rank is at least 3, the Dowling geometry uniquely determines the group. Dowling geometries have a role in matroid theory as universal objects (Kahn and Kung, 1982); in that respect they are analogous to projective geometries, but based on groups instead of fields.","image":"adcd912b73b5a1a423da61ee6d4f4c214993185f.svg","url":"Dowling_geometry"}
