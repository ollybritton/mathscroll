{"title":"Determinantal variety","summary":"In algebraic geometry, determinantal varieties are spaces of matrices with a given upper bound on their ranks. Their significance comes from the fact that many examples in algebraic geometry are of this form, such as the Segre embedding of a product of two projective spaces.","image":"41e98c8c7687ebe091b74cbdf98666f3f669d57b.svg","url":"Determinantal_variety"}
