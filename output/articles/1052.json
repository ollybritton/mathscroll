{"title":"Artin–Tits group","summary":"In the mathematical area of group theory, Artin groups, also known as Artin–Tits groups or generalized braid groups, are a family of infinite discrete groups defined by simple presentations. They are closely related with Coxeter groups. Examples are free groups, free abelian groups, braid groups, and right-angled Artin–Tits groups, among others.","image":"e9b1c8c8ab11906be07cd4a5f2b95de8def5281c.svg","url":"Artin–Tits_group"}
