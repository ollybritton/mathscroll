{"title":"De Bruijn graph","summary":"In graph theory, an n-dimensional De Bruijn graph of m symbols is a directed graph representing overlaps between sequences of symbols. It has mn vertices, consisting of all possible length-n sequences of the given symbols; the same symbol may appear multiple times in a sequence. For a set of m symbols S = {s1, â€¦, sm}, the set of vertices is:","image":"cb36badf475c5a6fe726d4faf30d86af7307cb77.svg","url":"De_Bruijn_graph"}
