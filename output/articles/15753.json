{"title":"Thrackle","summary":"A thrackle is an embedding of a graph in the plane, such that each edge is a Jordan arc and every pair of edges meet exactly once.  Edges may either meet at a common endpoint, or, if they have no endpoints in common, at a point in their interiors.  In the latter case, the crossing must be transverse.[1]","image":"Reinhardt_15-gons.svg.png.webp","url":"Thrackle"}
