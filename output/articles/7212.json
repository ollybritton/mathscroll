{"title":"Higuchi dimension","summary":"In fractal geometry, the Higuchi dimension (or Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD)) is an approximate value for the box-counting dimension of the graph of a real-valued function or time series. This value is obtained via an algorithmic approximation so one also talks about the Higuchi method. It has many applications in science and engineering and has been applied to subjects like characterizing primary waves in seismograms,[1] clinical neurophysiology[2] and analyzing changes in the electroencephalogram in Alzheimerâ€™s disease.[3]","image":"e13c042a0081e286dfd94f4185fff34ada7dbecb.svg","url":"Higuchi_dimension"}
