{"title":"McKay graph","summary":"In mathematics, the McKay graph of a finite-dimensional representation V of a finite group G is a weighted quiver encoding the structure of the representation theory of G. Each node represents an irreducible representation of G. If χ i, χ j are irreducible representations of G, then there is an arrow from χ i to χ j if and only if χ j is a constituent of the tensor product V ⊗ χ i . {\\displaystyle V\\otimes \\chi _{i}.} Then the weight nij of the arrow is the number of times this constituent appears in V ⊗ χ i . {\\displaystyle V\\otimes \\chi _{i}.} For finite subgroups H of GL ( 2 , C ) , {\\displaystyle {\\text{GL}}(2,\\mathbb {C} ),} the McKay graph of H is the McKay graph of the canonical representation of H.","image":"06fa5a89da9a576ca210a8ebc9e0bdb3e76a8612.svg","url":"McKay_graph"}
