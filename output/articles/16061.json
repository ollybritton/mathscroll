{"title":"Tridiminished icosahedron","summary":"In geometry, the tridiminished icosahedron is one of the Johnson solids (J63). The name refers to one way of constructing it, by removing three pentagonal pyramids (J2) from a regular icosahedron, which replaces three sets of five triangular faces from the icosahedron with three mutually adjacent pentagonal faces.","image":"Tridiminished_icosahedron.png.webp","url":"Tridiminished_icosahedron"}
