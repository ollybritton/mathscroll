{"title":"Decision tree model","summary":"In computational complexity the decision tree model is the model of computation in which an algorithm is considered to be basically a decision tree, i.e., a sequence of queries or tests that are done adaptively, so the outcome of previous tests can influence the tests performed next.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Decision_tree_model"}
