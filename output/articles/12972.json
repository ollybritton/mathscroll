{"title":"Quillen metric","summary":"In mathematics, and especially differential geometry, the Quillen metric is a metric on the determinant line bundle of a family of operators. It was introduced by Daniel Quillen[1] for certain elliptic operators over a Riemann surface, and generalized to higher-dimensional manifolds by Jean-Michel Bismut and Dan Freed.[2]","image":"875ab92f7e53970140b3663bc81e5fdcd9528a63.svg","url":"Quillen_metric"}
