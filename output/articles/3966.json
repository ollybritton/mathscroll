{"title":"Density on a manifold","summary":"In mathematics, and specifically differential geometry, a density is a spatially varying quantity on a differentiable manifold that can be integrated in an intrinsic manner. Abstractly, a density is a section of a certain line bundle, called the density bundle. An element of the density bundle at x is a function  that assigns a volume for the parallelotope spanned by the n given tangent vectors at x.","image":"c939a64d970d80a38b04d80b6971a27c5cfd0490.svg","url":"Density_on_a_manifold"}
