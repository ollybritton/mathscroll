{"title":"Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the Conway–Maxwell–Poisson (CMP or COM–Poisson) distribution is a discrete probability distribution named after Richard W. Conway, William L. Maxwell, and Siméon Denis Poisson that generalizes the Poisson distribution by adding a parameter to model overdispersion and underdispersion. It is a member of the exponential family,[1] has the Poisson distribution and geometric distribution as special cases and the Bernoulli distribution as a limiting case.[2]","image":"CMP_PMF.png.webp","url":"Conway–Maxwell–Poisson_distribution"}
