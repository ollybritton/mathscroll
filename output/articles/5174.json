{"title":"Exponential formula","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, the exponential formula (called the polymer expansion in physics) states that the exponential generating function for structures on finite sets is the exponential of the exponential generating function for connected structures. The exponential formula is a power-series version of a special case of Fa√† di Bruno's formula.","image":"4f49af81c269f1256c7ed665f95a1868fbace97f.svg","url":"Exponential_formula"}
