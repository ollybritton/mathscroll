{"title":"Model category","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in homotopy theory, a model category is a category with distinguished classes of morphisms ('arrows') called 'weak equivalences', 'fibrations' and 'cofibrations' satisfying certain axioms relating them. These abstract from the category of topological spaces or of chain complexes (derived category theory). The concept was introduced by Daniel G. QuillenÂ (1967).","image":"e26787affffd22458b880995530dfd4fa175e694.svg","url":"Model_category"}
