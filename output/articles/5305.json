{"title":"Fatou–Lebesgue theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Fatou–Lebesgue theorem establishes a chain of inequalities relating the integrals (in the sense of Lebesgue) of the limit inferior and the limit superior of a sequence of functions to the limit inferior and the limit superior of integrals of these functions.  The theorem is named after Pierre Fatou and Henri Léon Lebesgue.","image":"c03c57e98e9f2228da2cd9a4b79a7def949cc241.svg","url":"Fatou–Lebesgue_theorem"}
