{"title":"Addition principle","summary":"In combinatorics, the addition principle[1][2] or rule of sum[3][4] is a basic counting principle.  Stated simply, it is the intuitive idea that if we have A number of ways of doing something and B number of ways of doing another thing and we can not do both at the same time, then there are A + B {\\displaystyle A+B} ways to choose one of the actions.[3][1] In mathematical terms, the addition principle states that, for disjoint sets A and B, we have | A âˆª B | = | A | + | B | {\\displaystyle |A\\cup B|=|A|+|B|} .[2]","image":"4279cdbd3cb8ec4c3423065d9a7d83a82cfc89e3.svg","url":"Addition_principle"}
