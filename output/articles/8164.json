{"title":"Jacobi symbol","summary":"The Jacobi symbol is a generalization of the Legendre symbol. Introduced by Jacobi in 1837,[1] it is of theoretical interest in modular arithmetic and other branches of number theory, but its main use is in computational number theory, especially primality testing and integer factorization; these in turn are important in cryptography.","image":"c1e48012fdbbf29bbfee8086963aca393764e1b7.svg","url":"Jacobi_symbol"}
