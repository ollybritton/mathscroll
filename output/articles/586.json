{"title":"Algebraic cycle","summary":"In mathematics, an algebraic cycle on an algebraic variety V is a formal linear combination of subvarieties of V.  These are the part of the algebraic topology of V that is directly accessible by algebraic methods.  Understanding the algebraic cycles on a variety can give profound insights into the structure of the variety.","image":"a6980f2788edf633da4a717ef4273fa7dc2346be.svg","url":"Algebraic_cycle"}
