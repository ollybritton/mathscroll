{"title":"Ribbon knot","summary":"In the mathematical area of knot theory, a ribbon knot is a knot that bounds a self-intersecting disk with only ribbon singularities.  Intuitively, this kind of singularity can be formed by cutting a slit in the disk and passing another part of the disk through the slit. More precisely, this type of singularity is a closed arc consisting of intersection points of the disk with itself, such that the preimage of this arc consists of two arcs in the disc, one completely in the interior of the disk and the other having its two endpoints on the disk boundary.","image":"Ribbon_knot_8_20.jpg.webp","url":"Ribbon_knot"}
