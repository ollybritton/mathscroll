{"title":"Stufe (algebra)","summary":"In field theory, a branch of mathematics, the Stufe (/ʃtuːfə/; German: level) s(F) of a field F is the least number of squares that sum to −1. If −1 cannot be written as a sum of squares, s(F) = ∞ {\\displaystyle \\infty } . In this case, F is a formally real field.  Albrecht Pfister proved that the Stufe, if finite, is always a power of 2, and that conversely every power of 2 occurs.[1]","image":"c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21.svg","url":"Stufe_(algebra)"}
