{"title":"Barnes G-function","summary":"In mathematics, the Barnes G-function G(z) is a function that is an extension of superfactorials to the complex numbers. It is related to the gamma function, the K-function and the Glaisherâ€“Kinkelin constant, and was named after mathematician Ernest William Barnes.[1] It can be written in terms of the double gamma function.","image":"Plot_of_the_Barnes_G_aka_double_gamma_function_G(z)_in_the_complex_plane_from_-2-2i_to_2%2B2i_with_colors_created_with_Mathematica_13.1_function_ComplexPlot3D.svg.png.webp","url":"Barnes_G-function"}
