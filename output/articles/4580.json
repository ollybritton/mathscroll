{"title":"Eakin–Nagata theorem","summary":"In abstract algebra, the Eakin–Nagata theorem states: given commutative rings A ⊂ B {\\displaystyle A\\subset B} such that B {\\displaystyle B} is finitely generated as a module over A {\\displaystyle A} , if B {\\displaystyle B} is a Noetherian ring, then A {\\displaystyle A} is a Noetherian ring.[1] (Note the converse is also true and is easier.)","image":"010e98bb4c817357e3ef7e8fa7fbe2385b2aec6e.svg","url":"Eakin–Nagata_theorem"}
