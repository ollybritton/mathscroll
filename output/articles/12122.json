{"title":"Phase space","summary":"In dynamical systems theory and control theory, a phase space or state space is a space in which all possible \"states\" of a dynamical system or a control system are represented, with each possible state corresponding to one unique point in the phase space. For mechanical systems, the phase space usually consists of all possible values of position and momentum variables. It is the direct product of direct space and reciprocal space. The concept of phase space was developed in the late 19th century by Ludwig Boltzmann, Henri Poincar√©, and Josiah Willard Gibbs.[1]","image":"Comet_plot_1.gif","url":"Phase_space"}
