{"title":"Entropy coding","summary":"In information theory, an entropy coding (or entropy encoding) is any lossless data compression method that attempts to approach the lower bound declared by Shannon's source coding theorem, which states that any lossless data compression method must have expected code length greater or equal to the entropy of the source.[1]","image":"0f94727ba75e7f47c300c86f901598e22dfedd60.svg","url":"Entropy_coding"}
