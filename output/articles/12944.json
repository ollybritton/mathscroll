{"title":"Quasisymmetric function","summary":"In algebra and in particular in algebraic combinatorics, a quasisymmetric function is any element in the ring of quasisymmetric functions which is in turn a subring of the formal power series ring with a countable number of variables.  This ring generalizes  the ring of symmetric functions.  This ring can be realized as a specific limit of the rings of quasisymmetric polynomials in n variables, as n goes to infinity. This ring serves as universal structure in which relations between quasisymmetric polynomials can be expressed in a way independent of the number n of variables (but its elements are neither polynomials nor functions).","image":"8b29181e699dc6bbeca3789cd020ef5f4b296182.svg","url":"Quasisymmetric_function"}
