{"title":"Molien's formula","summary":"In mathematics, Molien's formula computes the generating function attached to a linear representation of a group G on a finite-dimensional vector space, that counts the homogeneous polynomials of a given total degree that are invariants for G. It is named for Theodor Molien.","image":"aa9f6f0164131c9278ec846cc942c0748ee699ec.svg","url":"Molien's_formula"}
