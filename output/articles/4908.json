{"title":"Equicontinuity","summary":"In mathematical analysis, a family of functions is equicontinuous if all the functions are continuous and they have equal variation over a given neighbourhood, in a precise sense described herein. In particular, the concept applies to countable families, and thus sequences of functions.","image":"393d99704dbe8cc35419558c3a6800ec9c3dbb4a.svg","url":"Equicontinuity"}
