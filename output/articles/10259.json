{"title":"Mean squared prediction error","summary":"In statistics the mean squared prediction error (MSPE), also known as mean squared error of the predictions, of a smoothing, curve fitting, or regression procedure is the expected value of the squared prediction errors (PE), the square difference between the fitted values implied by the predictive function g ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {g}}} and the values of the (unobservable) true value g. It is an inverse measure of the explanatory power of g ^ , {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {g}},} and can be used in the process of cross-validation of an estimated model. Knowledge of g would be required in order to calculate the MSPE exactly; in practice, MSPE is estimated.[1]","image":"f03ff4b434f75ad5db89ea97ae9f4336927e6d9f.svg","url":"Mean_squared_prediction_error"}
