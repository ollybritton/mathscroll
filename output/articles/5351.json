{"title":"Fermat's Last Theorem (book)","summary":"Fermat's Last Theorem is a popular science book (1997) by Simon Singh. It tells the story of the search for a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637, and explores how many mathematicians such as Ã‰variste Galois had tried and failed to provide a proof for the theorem.[1][2][3][4] Despite the efforts of many mathematicians, the proof would remain incomplete until 1995, with the publication of Andrew Wiles' proof of the Theorem. The book is the first mathematics book to become a Number One seller in the United Kingdom,[5] whilst Singh's documentary The Proof, on which the book was based, won a BAFTA in 1997.[6]","image":"Fermats-last-theorem-bookcover.jpg.webp","url":"Fermat's_Last_Theorem_(book)"}
