{"title":"Kendall tau distance","summary":"The Kendall tau rank distance is a metric (distance function) that counts the number of pairwise disagreements between two ranking lists. The larger the distance, the more dissimilar the two lists are. Kendall tau distance is also called bubble-sort distance since it is equivalent to the number of swaps that the bubble sort algorithm would take to place one list in the same order as the other list. The Kendall tau distance was created by Maurice Kendall.","image":"ef3e70085bbfec0d2ed0f898618bbb48db4ab7b1.svg","url":"Kendall_tau_distance"}
