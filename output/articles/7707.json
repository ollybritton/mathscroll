{"title":"Indefinite and fictitious numbers","summary":"Many languages have words expressing indefinite and fictitious numbersâ€”inexact terms of indefinite size, used for comic effect, for exaggeration, as placeholder names, or when precision is unnecessary or undesirable. One technical term for such words is \"non-numerical vague quantifier\".[1] Such words designed to indicate large quantities can be called \"indefinite hyperbolic numerals\".[2]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Indefinite_and_fictitious_numbers"}
