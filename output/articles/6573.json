{"title":"Greenberg–Hastings cellular automaton","summary":"The Greenberg–Hastings Cellular Automaton (abbrev. GH model) is a three state two dimensional cellular automaton (abbrev CA) named after James M. Greenberg and Stuart Hastings,[1] designed to model excitable media,[2]   One advantage of a CA model is ease of computation. The model can be understood quite well using simple \"hand\" calculations, not involving a computer.[2] Another advantage is that, at least in this case, one can prove a theorem characterizing those initial conditions which lead to repetitive behavior.[3]","image":"9db5b50c7da64c415db32937c1f213d74767d43d.svg","url":"Greenberg–Hastings_cellular_automaton"}
