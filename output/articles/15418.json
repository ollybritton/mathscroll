{"title":"System L","summary":"System L is a natural deductive logic developed by E.J. Lemmon.[1] Derived from Suppes' method,[2] it represents natural deduction proofs as sequences of justified steps. Both methods are derived from Gentzen's 1934/1935 natural deduction system,[3] in which proofs were presented in tree-diagram form rather than in the tabular form of Suppes and Lemmon. Although the tree-diagram layout has advantages for philosophical and educational purposes, the tabular layout is much more convenient for practical applications.","image":"5fbd8fb77c41431f6ae4b3e7d71d2a76855aead8.svg","url":"System_L"}
