{"title":"Euler's continued fraction formula","summary":"In the analytic theory of continued fractions, Euler's continued fraction formula is an identity connecting a certain very general infinite series with an infinite continued fraction. First published in 1748, it was at first regarded as a simple identity connecting a finite sum with a finite continued fraction in such a way that the extension to the infinite case was immediately apparent.[1] Today it is more fully appreciated as a useful tool in analytic attacks on the general convergence problem for infinite continued fractions with complex elements.","image":"2a3330abc088ab1f6283e0bbc2e6b0924c82fe0e.svg","url":"Euler's_continued_fraction_formula"}
