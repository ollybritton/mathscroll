{"title":"Convergence space","summary":"In mathematics, a convergence space, also called a generalized convergence, is a set together with a relation called a convergence that satisfies certain properties relating elements of X with the family of filters on X.  Convergence spaces generalize the notions of convergence that are found in point-set topology, including metric convergence and uniform convergence.  Every topological space gives rise to a canonical convergence but there are convergences, known as non-topological convergences, that do not arise from any topological space.[1] Examples of convergences that are in general non-topological include convergence in measure and almost everywhere convergence. Many topological properties have generalizations to convergence spaces.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Convergence_space"}
