{"title":"Fermat's theorem (stationary points)","summary":"In mathematics, Fermat's theorem (also known as interior extremum theorem) is a method to find local maxima and minima of differentiable functions on open sets by showing that every local extremum of the function is a stationary point (the function's derivative is zero at that point).  Fermat's theorem is a theorem in real analysis, named after Pierre de Fermat.","image":"07d97d49d29cc57cce35ed58129778c7bb0d8501.svg","url":"Fermat's_theorem_(stationary_points)"}
