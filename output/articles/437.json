{"title":"Affine monoid","summary":"In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, an affine monoid is a commutative monoid that is finitely generated, and is isomorphic to a submonoid of a free abelian group Z d , d â‰¥ 0 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} ^{d},d\\geq 0} .[1]  Affine monoids are closely connected to convex polyhedra, and their associated algebras are of much use in the algebraic study of these geometric objects.","image":"82a9484e06078b9685138c92795e9b64593e7783.svg","url":"Affine_monoid"}
