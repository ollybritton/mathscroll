{"title":"Galois ring","summary":"In mathematics, Galois rings are a type of finite commutative rings which generalize both the finite fields and the rings of integers modulo a prime power. A Galois ring is constructed from the ring Z / p n Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} /p^{n}\\mathbb {Z} } similar to how a finite field F p r {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{p^{r}}} is constructed from F p {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{p}} . It is a Galois extension of Z / p n Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} /p^{n}\\mathbb {Z} } , when the concept of a Galois extension is generalized beyond the context of fields.","image":"3f568eec3d80f812c3d02a19a445f088e888c180.svg","url":"Galois_ring"}
