{"title":"Connected relation","summary":"In mathematics, a relation on a set is called connected or complete or total if it relates (or \"compares\") all distinct pairs of elements of the set in one direction or the other while it is called strongly connected if it relates all pairs of elements.  As described in the terminology section below, the terminology for these properties is not uniform. This notion of \"total\" should not be confused with that of a total relation in the sense that for all x ∈ X {\\displaystyle x\\in X} there is a y ∈ X {\\displaystyle y\\in X} so that x R y {\\displaystyle x\\mathrel {R} y} (see serial relation).","image":"3e580967f68f36743e894aa7944f032dda6ea01d.svg","url":"Connected_relation"}
