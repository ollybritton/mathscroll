{"title":"Order-7 tetrahedral honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the order-7 tetrahedral honeycomb is a regular space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) with Schl√§fli symbol {3,3,7}. It has seven tetrahedra {3,3} around each edge. All vertices are ultra-ideal (existing beyond the ideal boundary) with infinitely many tetrahedra existing around each vertex in an order-7 triangular tiling vertex arrangement.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Order-7_tetrahedral_honeycomb"}
