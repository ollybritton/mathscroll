{"title":"Mapping cone (homological algebra)","summary":"In homological algebra, the mapping cone is a construction on a map of chain complexes inspired by the analogous construction in topology.  In the theory of triangulated categories it is a kind of combined kernel and cokernel: if the chain complexes take their terms in an abelian category, so that we can talk about cohomology, then the cone of a map f being acyclic means that the map is a quasi-isomorphism; if we pass to the derived category of complexes, this means that f is an isomorphism there, which recalls the familiar property of maps of groups, modules over a ring, or elements of an arbitrary abelian category that if the kernel and cokernel both vanish, then the map is an isomorphism.  If we are working in a t-category, then in fact the cone furnishes both the kernel and cokernel of maps between objects of its core.","image":"96c3298ea9aa77c226be56a7d8515baaa517b90b.svg","url":"Mapping_cone_(homological_algebra)"}
