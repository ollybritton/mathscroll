{"title":"Spline wavelet","summary":"In the mathematical theory of wavelets, a spline wavelet is a wavelet constructed using a spline function.[1] There are different types of spline wavelets. The interpolatory spline wavelets introduced by C.K. Chui and J.Z. Wang are based on a certain spline interpolation formula.[2] Though these wavelets are orthogonal, they do not have compact supports. There is a certain class of wavelets, unique in some sense, constructed using B-splines and having compact supports.  Even though these wavelets are not orthogonal they have some special properties that  have made them quite popular.[3]  The terminology spline wavelet is sometimes used to refer to the wavelets in this  class of  spline wavelets. These special wavelets are  also called B-spline wavelets and cardinal B-spline wavelets.[4] The Battle-Lemarie wavelets are also wavelets constructed using spline functions.[5]","image":"Animation_showing_images_of_compactly_supported_B_spline_wavelets.gif","url":"Spline_wavelet"}
