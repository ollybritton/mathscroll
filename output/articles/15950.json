{"title":"Transcendental extension","summary":"In mathematics, a transcendental extension L / K {\\displaystyle L/K} is a field extension such that there exists an element in the field L {\\displaystyle L} that is transcendental over the field K {\\displaystyle K} ; that is, an element that is not a root of any univariate polynomial with coefficients in K {\\displaystyle K} . In other words, a transcendental extension is a field extension that is not algebraic. For example, C , R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ,\\mathbb {R} } are both transcendental extensions of Q . {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} .}","image":"d0381945929156997b99bb43e5b7067d18c9a84b.svg","url":"Transcendental_extension"}
