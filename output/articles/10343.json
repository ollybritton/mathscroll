{"title":"Metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (J74). It can be constructed as a rhombicosidodecahedron with two non-opposing pentagonal cupolae rotated through 36 degrees. It is also a canonical polyhedron.","image":"Metabigyrate_rhombicosidodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Metabigyrate_rhombicosidodecahedron"}
