{"title":"Conformal loop ensemble","summary":"A conformal loop ensemble (CLEκ) is a random collection of non-crossing loops in a simply connected, open subset of the plane. These random collections of loops are indexed by a parameter κ, which may be any real number between 8/3 and 8. CLEκ is a loop version of the Schramm-Loewner evolution: SLEκ is designed to model a single discrete random interface, while CLEκ models a full collection of interfaces.","image":"page1-220px-CLE6_Percolation_Interfaces.pdf.jpg.webp","url":"Conformal_loop_ensemble"}
