{"title":"Saito–Kurokawa lift","summary":"In mathematics, the Saito–Kurokawa lift (or lifting) takes elliptic modular forms to Siegel modular forms of degree 2. The existence of this lifting was conjectured in 1977 independently by Hiroshi Saito and Nobushige Kurokawa (1978). Its existence was almost proved by Maass (1979a, 1979b, 1979c), and Andrianov (1979) and Zagier (1981) completed the proof.","image":"69c9d3efb276139f17ac3799d1821b6c49999787.svg","url":"Saito–Kurokawa_lift"}
