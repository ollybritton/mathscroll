{"title":"Real projective plane","summary":"In mathematics, the real projective plane is an example of a compact non-orientable two-dimensional manifold; in other words, a one-sided surface.  It cannot be embedded in standard three-dimensional space without intersecting itself. It has basic applications to geometry, since the common construction of the real projective plane is as the space of lines in R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} passing through the origin.","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg","url":"Real_projective_plane"}
