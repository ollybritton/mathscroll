{"title":"Dedekind–MacNeille completion","summary":"In mathematics, specifically order theory, the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of a partially ordered set is the smallest complete lattice that contains it. It is named after Holbrook Mann MacNeille whose 1937 paper first defined and constructed it, and after Richard Dedekind because its construction generalizes the Dedekind cuts used by Dedekind to construct the real numbers from the rational numbers. It is also called the completion by cuts or normal completion.[1]","image":"Dedekind-Macneille_completion.svg.png.webp","url":"Dedekind–MacNeille_completion"}
