{"title":"General linear methods","summary":"General linear methods (GLMs) are a large class of numerical methods used to obtain numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations. They include multistage Rungeâ€“Kutta methods that use intermediate collocation points, as well as linear multistep methods that save a finite time history of the solution. John C. Butcher originally coined this term for these methods, and has written a series of review papers[1] [2] [3] a book chapter[4] and a textbook[5] on the topic. His collaborator, Zdzislaw Jackiewicz also has an extensive textbook[6] on the topic.  The original class of methods were originally proposed by Butcher (1965), Gear (1965) and Gragg and Stetter (1964).","image":"efd412048e03327a10228cf471e1b3cb964dfc3b.svg","url":"General_linear_methods"}
