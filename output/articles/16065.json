{"title":"Trigenus","summary":"In low-dimensional topology, the trigenus of a closed 3-manifold is an invariant consisting of an ordered triple ( g 1 , g 2 , g 3 ) {\\displaystyle (g_{1},g_{2},g_{3})} .  It is obtained by minimizing the genera of three orientable handle bodies — with no intersection between their interiors— which decompose the manifold as far as the Heegaard genus need only two.","image":"2baefc5da6476ac70b876770d1185053c0f77754.svg","url":"Trigenus"}
