{"title":"Lift (mathematics)","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, given a morphism f: X → Y and a morphism g: Z → Y, a lift or lifting of f to Z is a morphism h: X → Z such that f = g∘h. We say that f factors through h.","image":"Lifting_diagram.png.webp","url":"Lift_(mathematics)"}
