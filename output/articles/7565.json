{"title":"I-bundle","summary":"In mathematics, an I-bundle is a fiber bundle whose fiber is an interval and whose base is a manifold.  Any kind of interval, open, closed, semi-open, semi-closed, open-bounded, compact, even rays, can be the fiber. An I-bundle is said to be twisted if it is not trivial.","image":"MobiusF.PNG.webp","url":"I-bundle"}
