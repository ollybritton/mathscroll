{"title":"Ricci curvature","summary":"In differential geometry, the Ricci curvature tensor, named after Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, is a geometric object which is determined by a choice of Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian metric on a manifold. It can be considered, broadly, as a measure of the degree to which the geometry of a given metric tensor differs locally from that of ordinary Euclidean space or pseudo-Euclidean space.","image":"b487026b0c2aae9757f9fdea4d58704078e98f48.svg","url":"Ricci_curvature"}
