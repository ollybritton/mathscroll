{"title":"Riemann curvature tensor","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, the Riemann curvature tensor or Riemannâ€“Christoffel tensor (after Bernhard Riemann and Elwin Bruno Christoffel) is the most common way used to express the curvature of Riemannian manifolds.  It assigns a tensor to each point of a Riemannian manifold (i.e., it is a tensor field). It is a local invariant of Riemannian metrics which measures the failure of the second covariant derivatives to commute. A Riemannian manifold has zero curvature if and only if it is flat, i.e. locally isometric to the Euclidean space.[1] The curvature tensor can also be defined for any pseudo-Riemannian manifold, or indeed any manifold equipped with an affine connection.","image":"Spacetime_lattice_analogy.svg.png.webp","url":"Riemann_curvature_tensor"}
