{"title":"Direct product of groups","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in group theory, the direct product is an operation that takes two groups G and H and constructs a new group, usually denoted G Ã— H.  This operation is the group-theoretic analogue of the Cartesian product of sets and is one of several important notions of direct product in mathematics.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Direct_product_of_groups"}
