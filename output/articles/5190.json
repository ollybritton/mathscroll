{"title":"Exponentiation","summary":"In mathematics, exponentiation is an operation involving two numbers, the base and the exponent or power. Exponentiation is written as bn, where b is the base and n is the power; this is pronounced as \"b (raised) to the (power of) n\".[1] When n is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, bn is the product of multiplying n bases:[1]","image":"dcb8949e2c2dbe952c87d89e208b8018f107ad79.svg","url":"Exponentiation"}
