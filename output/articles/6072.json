{"title":"Generalized extreme value distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution[3] is a family of continuous probability distributions developed within extreme value theory to combine the Gumbel, Fr√©chet and Weibull families also known as type I, II and III extreme value distributions. By the extreme value theorem the GEV distribution is the only possible limit distribution of properly normalized maxima of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables.[4] Note that a limit distribution needs to exist, which requires regularity conditions on the tail of the distribution.  Despite this, the GEV distribution is often used as an approximation to model the maxima of long (finite) sequences of random variables.","image":"75afb1aca6c44e6d6d0201667db097defb368008.svg","url":"Generalized_extreme_value_distribution"}
