{"title":"Transfer principle","summary":"In model theory, a transfer principle states that all statements of some language that are true for some structure are true for another structure. One of the first examples was the Lefschetz principle, which states that any sentence in the first-order language of fields that is true for the complex numbers is also true for any algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.","image":"f0e10667bad240500f5044257143510127e03d69.svg","url":"Transfer_principle"}
