{"title":"Evolutionary multimodal optimization","summary":"In applied mathematics, multimodal optimization deals with optimization tasks that involve finding all or most of the multiple (at least locally optimal) solutions of a problem, as opposed to a single best solution. Evolutionary multimodal optimization is a branch of evolutionary computation, which is closely related to machine learning. Wong provides a short survey,[1] wherein the chapter of Shir[2] and the book of Preuss[3] cover the topic in more detail.","image":"Max_paraboloid.svg.png.webp","url":"Evolutionary_multimodal_optimization"}
