{"title":"Mantel test","summary":"The Mantel test, named after Nathan Mantel, is a statistical test of the correlation between two matrices. The matrices must be of the same dimension; in most applications, they are matrices of interrelations between the same vectors of objects. The test was first published by Nathan Mantel, a biostatistician at the National Institutes of Health, in 1967.[1] Accounts of it can be found in advanced statistics books (e.g., Sokal & Rohlf 1995[2]).","image":"4d7e4c7b0026c4729031e5aa8110d5bb700d0162.svg","url":"Mantel_test"}
