{"title":"F-coalgebra","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in category theory, an F {\\displaystyle F} -coalgebra is a structure defined according to a functor F {\\displaystyle F} , with specific properties as defined below. For both algebras and coalgebras, a functor is a convenient and general way of organizing a signature.  This has applications in computer science: examples of coalgebras include lazy, infinite data structures, such as streams, and also transition systems.","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"F-coalgebra"}
