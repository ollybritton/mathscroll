{"title":"Ordinal analysis","summary":"In proof theory, ordinal analysis assigns ordinals (often large countable ordinals) to mathematical theories as a measure of their strength. If theories have the same proof-theoretic ordinal they are often equiconsistent, and if one theory has a larger proof-theoretic ordinal than another it can often prove the consistency of the second theory.","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Ordinal_analysis"}
