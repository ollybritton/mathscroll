{"title":"Monogenic field","summary":"In mathematics, a monogenic field is an algebraic number field K for which there exists an element a such that the ring of integers OK is the subring Z[a] of K generated by a. Then OK is a quotient of the polynomial ring Z[X] and the powers of a constitute a power integral basis.","image":"ed1aec67eeef706461fb49db7a08d5f01a5c5616.svg","url":"Monogenic_field"}
