{"title":"Disperser","summary":"A disperser is a one-sided extractor.[1] Where an extractor requires that every event gets the same probability under the uniform distribution and the extracted distribution, only the latter is required for a disperser. So for a disperser, an event A ⊆ { 0 , 1 } m {\\displaystyle A\\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^{m}} we have: P r U m [ A ] > 1 − ϵ {\\displaystyle Pr_{U_{m}}[A]>1-\\epsilon }","image":"5d9d202bb4f2fd61ed36bba4304745345036032e.svg","url":"Disperser"}
