{"title":"Caustic (mathematics)","summary":"In differential geometry, a caustic is the envelope of rays either reflected or refracted by a manifold. It is related to the concept of caustics in geometric optics. The ray's source may be a point (called the radiant) or parallel rays from a point at infinity, in which case a direction vector of the rays must be specified.","image":"Circle_caustic.png.webp","url":"Caustic_(mathematics)"}
