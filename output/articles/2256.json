{"title":"Carmichael's totient function conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, Carmichael's totient function conjecture concerns the multiplicity of values of Euler's totient function φ(n),  which counts the number of integers less than and coprime to n. It states that, for every n there is at least one other integer m ≠ n such that φ(m) = φ(n). Robert Carmichael first stated this conjecture in 1907, but as a theorem rather than as a conjecture. However, his proof was faulty, and in 1922, he retracted his claim and stated the conjecture as an open problem.","image":"759ae5bc851697fa14319c1b9e736593cb2d5426.svg","url":"Carmichael's_totient_function_conjecture"}
