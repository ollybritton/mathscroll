{"title":"Bott periodicity theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Bott periodicity theorem describes a periodicity in the homotopy groups of classical groups, discovered by Raoul BottÂ (1957, 1959), which proved to be of foundational significance for much further research, in particular in K-theory of stable complex vector bundles, as well as the stable homotopy groups of spheres. Bott periodicity can be formulated in numerous ways, with the periodicity in question always appearing as a period-2 phenomenon, with respect to dimension, for the theory associated to the unitary group. See for example topological K-theory.","image":"1b333ad74141a87280c1fbe4ae31d7bc0dcc572a.svg","url":"Bott_periodicity_theorem"}
