{"title":"Matérn covariance function","summary":"In statistics, the Matérn covariance, also called the Matérn kernel,[1]  is a covariance function used in spatial statistics, geostatistics, machine learning, image analysis, and other applications of multivariate statistical analysis on metric spaces. It is named after the Swedish forestry statistician Bertil Matérn.[2] It specifies the covariance between two measurements as a function of the distance between the points at which they are taken. Since the covariance only depends on distances between points, it is stationary. If the distance is Euclidean distance, the Matérn covariance is also isotropic.","image":"7c8457e6e5b3b4f8767a0dc9352f6c76572d4d78.svg","url":"Matérn_covariance_function"}
