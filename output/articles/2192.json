{"title":"Cantitruncated 24-cell honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the cantitruncated 24-cell honeycomb is a uniform space-filling honeycomb. It can be seen as a cantitruncation of the regular 24-cell honeycomb, containing truncated tesseract, cantitruncated 24-cell, and tetrahedral prism cells.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Cantitruncated_24-cell_honeycomb"}
