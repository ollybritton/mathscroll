{"title":"Algebraic independence","summary":"In abstract algebra, a subset S {\\displaystyle S} of a field L {\\displaystyle L} is algebraically independent over a subfield K {\\displaystyle K} if the elements of S {\\displaystyle S} do not satisfy any non-trivial polynomial equation with coefficients in K {\\displaystyle K} .","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Algebraic_independence"}
