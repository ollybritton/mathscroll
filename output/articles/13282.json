{"title":"Reflection principle (Wiener process)","summary":"In the theory of probability for stochastic processes, the reflection principle for a Wiener process states that if the path of a Wiener process f(t)  reaches a value f(s) = a at time t = s,  then the subsequent path after time s has the same distribution as the reflection of the subsequent path about the value a.[1] More formally, the reflection principle refers to a lemma concerning the distribution of the supremum of the Wiener process, or Brownian motion. The result relates the distribution of the supremum of Brownian motion up to time t to the distribution of the process at time t. It is a corollary of the strong Markov property of Brownian motion.","image":"Wiener_process_and_its_reflection_upon_reaching_a_crossing_point.png.webp","url":"Reflection_principle_(Wiener_process)"}
