{"title":"Hilbert–Schmidt theorem","summary":"In mathematical analysis, the Hilbert–Schmidt theorem, also known as the eigenfunction expansion theorem, is a fundamental result concerning compact, self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces. In the theory of partial differential equations, it is very useful in solving elliptic boundary value problems.","image":"bb5d6cd19fb450afd9fc4db26293ffef042385bc.svg","url":"Hilbert–Schmidt_theorem"}
