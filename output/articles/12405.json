{"title":"Positive real numbers","summary":"In mathematics, the set of positive real numbers, R > 0 = { x ∈ R ∣ x > 0 } , {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} _{>0}=\\left\\{x\\in \\mathbb {R} \\mid x>0\\right\\},} is the subset of those real numbers that are greater than zero. The non-negative real numbers, R ≥ 0 = { x ∈ R ∣ x ≥ 0 } , {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} _{\\geq 0}=\\left\\{x\\in \\mathbb {R} \\mid x\\geq 0\\right\\},} also include zero. Although the symbols R + {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} _{+}} and R + {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{+}} are ambiguously used for either of these, the notation R + {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} _{+}} or R + {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{+}} for { x ∈ R ∣ x ≥ 0 } {\\displaystyle \\left\\{x\\in \\mathbb {R} \\mid x\\geq 0\\right\\}} and R + ∗ {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} _{+}^{*}} or R ∗ + {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} _{*}^{+}} for { x ∈ R ∣ x > 0 } {\\displaystyle \\left\\{x\\in \\mathbb {R} \\mid x>0\\right\\}} has also been widely employed, is aligned with the practice in algebra of denoting the exclusion of the zero element with a star, and should be understandable to most practicing mathematicians.[1]","image":"22f46f9efbdd742cd4c075dc49615f2f6ec26270.svg","url":"Positive_real_numbers"}
