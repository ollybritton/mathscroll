{"title":"Bicircular matroid","summary":"In the mathematical subject of matroid theory, the bicircular matroid of a graph G is the matroid B(G) whose points are the edges of G and whose independent sets are the edge sets of pseudoforests of G, that is, the edge sets in which each connected component contains at most one cycle.","image":"0098a01074b0262ccca5591f9ff6c494cc2facb0.svg","url":"Bicircular_matroid"}
