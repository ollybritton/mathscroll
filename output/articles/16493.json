{"title":"Valuation (measure theory)","summary":"In measure theory, or at least in the approach to it via the domain theory, a valuation is a map from the class of open sets of a topological space to the set of positive real numbers including infinity, with certain properties. It is a concept closely related to that of a measure, and as such, it finds applications in measure theory, probability theory, and theoretical computer science.","image":"65e87bb8cff487505e4681bfb2d0ffb15e7d0ba5.svg","url":"Valuation_(measure_theory)"}
