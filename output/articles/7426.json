{"title":"Householder's method","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in numerical analysis, Householder's methods are a class of root-finding algorithms that are used for functions of one real variable with continuous derivatives up to some order d + 1. Each of these methods is characterized by the number d, which is known as the order of the method. The algorithm is iterative and has a rate of convergence of d + 1.","image":"b23f6005d9794962abace270986343d6f9d5e350.svg","url":"Householder's_method"}
