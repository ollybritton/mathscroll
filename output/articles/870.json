{"title":"Antiparallel (mathematics)","summary":"In geometry, two lines l 1 {\\displaystyle l_{1}} and l 2 {\\displaystyle l_{2}} are antiparallel with respect to a given line m {\\displaystyle m} if they each make congruent angles with m {\\displaystyle m} in opposite senses. More generally, lines l 1 {\\displaystyle l_{1}} and l 2 {\\displaystyle l_{2}} are antiparallel with respect to another pair of lines m 1 {\\displaystyle m_{1}} and m 2 {\\displaystyle m_{2}} if they are antiparallel with respect to the angle bisector of m 1 {\\displaystyle m_{1}} and m 2 . {\\displaystyle m_{2}.}","image":"29b25eeca673386d676f79dce674fe93040693eb.svg","url":"Antiparallel_(mathematics)"}
