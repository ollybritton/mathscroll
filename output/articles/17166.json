{"title":"Zeta function regularization","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical physics, zeta function regularization is a type of regularization or summability method that assigns finite values to  divergent sums or products, and in particular can be used to define determinants and traces of some self-adjoint operators. The technique is now commonly applied to problems in physics, but has its origins in attempts to give precise meanings to ill-conditioned sums appearing in number theory.","image":"f043681eb3644f03afed6921bd2f3e4ef87b496d.svg","url":"Zeta_function_regularization"}
