{"title":"Tucker decomposition","summary":"In mathematics, Tucker decomposition decomposes a tensor into a set of matrices and one small core tensor.  It is named after Ledyard R. Tucker[1] although it goes back to Hitchcock in 1927.[2] Initially described as a three-mode extension of factor analysis and principal component analysis it may actually be generalized to higher mode analysis, which is also called higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD).","image":"8bee00281d4a30b15da88538e876f0762626575a.svg","url":"Tucker_decomposition"}
