{"title":"Disjoint union (topology)","summary":"In general topology and related areas of mathematics, the disjoint union (also called the  direct sum, free union, free sum, topological sum, or coproduct) of a family of topological spaces is a space formed by equipping the disjoint union of the underlying sets with a natural topology called the disjoint union topology. Roughly speaking, in the disjoint union the given spaces are considered as part of a single new space where each looks as it would alone and they are isolated from each other.","image":"ca092dbc0d0c27dfad93d4e466aebe943d417290.svg","url":"Disjoint_union_(topology)"}
