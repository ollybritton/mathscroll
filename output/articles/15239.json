{"title":"Sum of squares function","summary":"In number theory, the sum of squares function is an arithmetic function that gives the number of representations for a given positive integer n as the sum of k squares, where representations that differ only in the order of the summands or in the signs of the numbers being squared are counted as different, and is denoted by rk(n).","image":"51841afcdea3d262a941bccaa41c8e156c8234a1.svg","url":"Sum_of_squares_function"}
