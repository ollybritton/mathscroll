{"title":"Collineation","summary":"In projective geometry, a collineation is a one-to-one and onto map (a bijection) from one projective space to another, or from a projective space to itself, such that the images of collinear points are themselves collinear. A collineation is thus an isomorphism between projective spaces, or an automorphism from a projective space to itself. Some authors restrict the definition of collineation to the case where it is an automorphism.[1] The set of all collineations of a space to itself form a group, called the collineation group.","image":"1e59f6f6df9cd31df7016afaf45faf7cd34cf77c.svg","url":"Collineation"}
