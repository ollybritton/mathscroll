{"title":"Quadratic Gauss sum","summary":"In number theory, quadratic Gauss sums are certain finite sums of roots of unity. A quadratic Gauss sum can be interpreted as a linear combination of the values of the complex exponential function with coefficients given by a quadratic character; for a general character, one obtains a more general Gauss sum. These objects are named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who studied them extensively and applied them to quadratic, cubic, and biquadratic reciprocity laws.","image":"a7059d913f814da061114588dffdc07877594e80.svg","url":"Quadratic_Gauss_sum"}
