{"title":"Suslin's problem","summary":"In mathematics, Suslin's problem is a question about totally ordered sets posed by Mikhail Yakovlevich SuslinÂ (1920) and published posthumously. It has been shown to be independent of the standard axiomatic system of set theory known as ZFC: Solovay & Tennenbaum (1971) showed that the statement can neither be proven nor disproven from those axioms, assuming ZF is consistent.","image":"78c211ce8badf4ffbf9417ecceb0ef7ab0a8caed.svg","url":"Suslin's_problem"}
