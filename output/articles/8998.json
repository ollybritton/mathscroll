{"title":"Landau–Squire jet","summary":"In fluid dynamics, Landau–Squire jet or Submerged Landau jet describes a round submerged jet issued from a point source of momentum into an infinite fluid medium of the same kind. This is an exact solution to the incompressible form of the Navier-Stokes equations, which was first discovered by Lev Landau in 1944[1][2] and later by Herbert Squire in 1951.[3] The self-similar equation was in fact first derived by N. A. Slezkin in 1934,[4] but never applied to the jet. Following Landau's work, V. I. Yatseyev obtained the general solution of the equation in 1950.[5]","image":"Landau001.svg.png.webp","url":"Landau–Squire_jet"}
