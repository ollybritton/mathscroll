{"title":"Algebraic operation","summary":"In mathematics, a basic algebraic operation is any one of the common operations of arithmetic, which include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to a whole number power, and taking roots (fractional power).[1] These operations may be performed on numbers, in which case they are often called arithmetic operations. They may also be performed, in a similar way, on variables, algebraic expressions,[2] and more generally, on elements of algebraic structures, such as groups and fields.[3] An algebraic operation may also be defined simply as a function from a Cartesian power of a set to the same set.[4]","image":"Quadratic_root.svg.png.webp","url":"Algebraic_operation"}
