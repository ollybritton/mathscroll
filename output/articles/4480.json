{"title":"Dual Steenrod algebra","summary":"In algebraic topology, through an algebraic operation (dualization), there is an associated commutative algebra[1] from the noncommutative Steenrod algebras called the dual Steenrod algebra. This dual algebra has a number of surprising benefits, such as being commutative and provided technical tools for computing the Adams spectral sequence in many cases (such as π ∗ ( M U ) {\\displaystyle \\pi _{*}(MU)} [2]pg 61-62) with much ease.","image":"42916e9231a4ae24d916875fff1662a2f2efc544.svg","url":"Dual_Steenrod_algebra"}
