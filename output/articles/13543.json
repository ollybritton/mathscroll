{"title":"Riemann problem","summary":"A Riemann problem, named after Bernhard Riemann, is a specific initial value problem composed of a  conservation equation together with piecewise constant initial data which has a single discontinuity in the domain of interest. The Riemann problem is very useful for the understanding of equations like Euler conservation equations because all properties, such as shocks and rarefaction waves, appear as characteristics in the solution. It also gives an exact solution to some complex nonlinear equations, such as the Euler equations.","image":"e6a32352d96c45fe67e19b0f69e23661c27c8f6d.svg","url":"Riemann_problem"}
