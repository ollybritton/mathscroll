{"title":"Alexandrov theorem","summary":"In mathematical analysis, the Alexandrov theorem, named after Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov, states that if U is an open subset of R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} and f : U â†’ R m {\\displaystyle f\\colon U\\to \\mathbb {R} ^{m}} is a convex function, then f {\\displaystyle f} has a second derivative almost everywhere.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Alexandrov_theorem"}
