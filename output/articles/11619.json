{"title":"Osculating plane","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in differential geometry, an osculating plane is a plane in a Euclidean space or affine space which meets a submanifold at a point in such a way as to have a second order of contact at the point.  The word osculate is from the Latin osculatus which is a past participle of osculari, meaning to kiss.  An osculating plane is thus a plane which \"kisses\" a submanifold.","image":"Frenet.svg.png.webp","url":"Osculating_plane"}
