{"title":"Small-bias sample space","summary":"In theoretical computer science, a small-bias sample space (also known as ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } -biased sample space, ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } -biased generator, or small-bias probability space) is a probability distribution that fools parity functions. In other words, no parity function can distinguish between a small-bias sample space and the uniform distribution with high probability, and hence, small-bias sample spaces naturally give rise to pseudorandom generators for parity functions.","image":"c3837cad72483d97bcdde49c85d3b7b859fb3fd2.svg","url":"Small-bias_sample_space"}
