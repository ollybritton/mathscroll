{"title":"Square","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, π/2 radian angles, or right angles). It can also be defined as a rectangle with two equal-length adjacent sides. It is the only regular polygon whose internal angle, central angle, and external angle are all equal (90°), and whose diagonals are all equal in length. A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ◻ {\\displaystyle \\square } ABCD.[1]","image":"455831d58fa08f311b934d324adcff89a868b4e4.svg","url":"Square"}
