{"title":"Compact operator","summary":"In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, a compact operator is a linear operator T : X â†’ Y {\\displaystyle T:X\\to Y} , where X , Y {\\displaystyle X,Y} are normed vector spaces, with the property that T {\\displaystyle T} maps bounded subsets of X {\\displaystyle X} to relatively compact subsets of Y {\\displaystyle Y} (subsets with compact closure in Y {\\displaystyle Y} ). Such an operator is necessarily a bounded operator, and so continuous.[1] Some authors require that X , Y {\\displaystyle X,Y} are Banach, but the definition can be extended to more general spaces.","image":"d961a4704b054500d6ecff6b4caac6852982458c.svg","url":"Compact_operator"}
