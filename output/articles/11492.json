{"title":"Order-5 icosahedral 120-cell honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 4-space, the order-5 icosahedral 120-cell honeycomb is one of four regular star-honeycombs. With Schl√§fli symbol {3,5,5/2,5}, it has five icosahedral 120-cells around each face. It is dual to the great 120-cell honeycomb.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Order-5_icosahedral_120-cell_honeycomb"}
