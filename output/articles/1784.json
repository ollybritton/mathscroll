{"title":"Bochner's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Bochner's theorem (named for Salomon Bochner) characterizes the Fourier transform of a positive finite Borel measure on the real line. More generally in harmonic analysis, Bochner's theorem asserts that under Fourier transform a continuous positive-definite function on a locally compact abelian group corresponds to a finite positive measure on the Pontryagin dual group. The case of sequences was first established by Gustav Herglotz (see also the related Herglotz representation theorem.)[1]","image":"3257528da95b4ab702b74241ff5356d688de2ce0.svg","url":"Bochner's_theorem"}
