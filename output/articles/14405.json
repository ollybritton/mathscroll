{"title":"Simplectic honeycomb","summary":"In geometry, the simplectic honeycomb (or n-simplex honeycomb) is a dimensional infinite series of honeycombs, based on the A ~ n {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {A}}_{n}} affine Coxeter group symmetry. It is represented by a Coxeter-Dynkin diagram as a cyclic graph of n + 1 nodes with one node ringed. It is composed of n-simplex facets, along with all rectified n-simplices. It can be thought of as an n-dimensional hypercubic honeycomb that has been subdivided along all hyperplanes x + y + ⋯ ∈ Z {\\displaystyle x+y+\\cdots \\in \\mathbb {Z} } , then stretched along its main diagonal until the simplices on the ends of the hypercubes become regular. The vertex figure of an n-simplex honeycomb is an expanded n-simplex.","image":"0dd3539f67ef780c40d9fa80a95b764637fa74af.svg","url":"Simplectic_honeycomb"}
