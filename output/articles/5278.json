{"title":"Faithfully flat descent","summary":"Faithfully flat descent is a technique from algebraic geometry, allowing one to draw conclusions about objects on the target of a faithfully flat morphism. Such morphisms, that are flat and surjective, are common, one example coming from an open cover.","image":"d5b8dd84619daff17b52a08b77d15db2b9ad6c2a.svg","url":"Faithfully_flat_descent"}
