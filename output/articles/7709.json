{"title":"Indefinite orthogonal group","summary":"In mathematics, the indefinite orthogonal group, O(p, q) is the Lie group of all linear transformations of an n-dimensional real vector space that leave invariant a nondegenerate, symmetric bilinear form of signature (p, q), where n = p + q. It is also called the pseudo-orthogonal group[1] or generalized orthogonal group.[2] The dimension of the group is n(n âˆ’ 1)/2.","image":"93e57da660c728d3b6791e03386e7cceb6b8587a.svg","url":"Indefinite_orthogonal_group"}
