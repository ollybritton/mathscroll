{"title":"Damping matrix","summary":"In applied mathematics, a damping matrix is a matrix corresponding to any of certain systems of linear ordinary differential equations.  A damping matrix is defined as follows.  If the system has n degrees of freedom un and is under application of m damping forces. Each force can be expressed as follows:","image":"6b01fe6385ab6c62e31a30cf63cdf3a3962eefa0.svg","url":"Damping_matrix"}
