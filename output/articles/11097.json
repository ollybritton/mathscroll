{"title":"Nilmanifold","summary":"In mathematics,  a nilmanifold is a differentiable manifold which has a transitive nilpotent group of diffeomorphisms acting on it.  As such, a nilmanifold is an example of a homogeneous space and is diffeomorphic to the quotient space N / H {\\displaystyle N/H} , the quotient of a nilpotent Lie group N modulo a closed subgroup H.  This notion was introduced by Anatoly Mal'cev in 1951.","image":"827a971e9540e70c03c48321e8d679ccd6589de0.svg","url":"Nilmanifold"}
