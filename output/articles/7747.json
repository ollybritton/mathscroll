{"title":"Inductive type","summary":"In type theory, a system has inductive types if it has facilities for creating a new type from constants and functions that create terms of that type.  The feature serves a role similar to data structures in a programming language and allows a type theory to add concepts like numbers, relations, and trees.  As the name suggests, inductive types can be self-referential, but usually only in a way that permits structural recursion.","image":"17b927b828b740e1ee82b7f33efc95f9d24f70df.svg","url":"Inductive_type"}
