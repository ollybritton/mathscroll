{"title":"Special linear group","summary":"In mathematics, the special linear group SL(n, F) of degree n over a field F is the set of n Ã— n matrices with determinant 1, with the group operations of ordinary matrix multiplication and matrix inversion. This is the normal subgroup of the general linear group given by the kernel of the determinant","image":"c86e61f32b6ba9448d56cf43d6188dd32d04968f.svg","url":"Special_linear_group"}
