{"title":"Truncated tesseractic honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the truncated tesseractic honeycomb is a uniform  space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 4-space. It is constructed by a truncation of a tesseractic honeycomb creating truncated tesseracts, and adding new 16-cell facets at the original vertices.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Truncated_tesseractic_honeycomb"}
