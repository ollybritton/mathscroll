{"title":"Generalized game","summary":"In computational complexity theory, a generalized game is a game or puzzle that has been generalized so that it can be played on a board or grid of any size. For example, generalized chess is the game of chess played on an n × n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} board, with 2 n {\\displaystyle 2n} pieces on each side. Generalized Sudoku includes Sudokus constructed on an n × n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} grid.","image":"59d2b4cb72e304526cf5b5887147729ea259da78.svg","url":"Generalized_game"}
