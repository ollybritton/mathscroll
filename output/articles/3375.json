For example, the converse of the relation 'child of' is the relation 'parent of'. In formal terms, if X {\\displaystyle X} and Y {\\displaystyle Y} are sets and L ⊆ X × Y {\\displaystyle L\\subseteq X\\times Y} is a relation from X {\\displaystyle X} to Y , {\\displaystyle Y,} then L T {\\displaystyle L^{\\operatorname {T} }} is the relation defined so that y L T x {\\displaystyle yL^{\\operatorname {T} }x} if and only if x L y . {\\displaystyle xLy.} In set-builder notation,","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Converse_relation"}
