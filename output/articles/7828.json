{"title":"Inscribed figure","summary":"In geometry, an inscribed planar shape or solid is one that is enclosed by and \"fits snugly\" inside another geometric shape or solid. To say that \"figure F is inscribed in figure G\" means precisely the same thing as \"figure G is circumscribed about figure F\". A circle or ellipse inscribed in a convex polygon (or a sphere or ellipsoid inscribed in a convex polyhedron) is tangent to every side or face of the outer figure (but see Inscribed sphere for semantic variants). A polygon inscribed in a circle, ellipse, or polygon (or a polyhedron inscribed in a sphere, ellipsoid, or polyhedron) has each vertex on the outer figure; if the outer figure is a polygon or polyhedron, there must be a vertex of the inscribed polygon or polyhedron on each side of the outer figure. An inscribed figure is not necessarily unique in orientation; this can easily be seen, for example, when the given outer figure is a circle, in which case a rotation of an inscribed figure gives another inscribed figure that is congruent to the original one.","image":"Inscribed_circles.svg.png.webp","url":"Inscribed_figure"}
