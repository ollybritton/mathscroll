{"title":"Ultraconnected space","summary":"In mathematics, a topological space is said to be ultraconnected if no two nonempty closed sets are disjoint.[1] Equivalently, a space is ultraconnected if and only if the closures of two distinct points always have non trivial intersection. Hence, no T1 space with more than one point is ultraconnected.[2]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Ultraconnected_space"}
