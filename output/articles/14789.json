{"title":"Spherical polyhedron","summary":"In geometry, a spherical polyhedron or spherical tiling is a tiling of the sphere in which the surface is divided or partitioned by great arcs into bounded regions called spherical polygons. Much of the theory of symmetrical polyhedra is most conveniently derived in this way.","image":"Comparison_of_truncated_icosahedron_and_soccer_ball.png.webp","url":"Spherical_polyhedron"}
