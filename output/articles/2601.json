{"title":"Chow group","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the Chow groups (named after Wei-Liang Chow by Claude Chevalley (1958)) of an algebraic variety over any field are algebro-geometric analogs of the homology of a topological space. The elements of the Chow group are formed out of subvarieties (so-called algebraic cycles) in a similar way to how simplicial or cellular homology groups are formed out of subcomplexes.  When the variety is smooth, the Chow groups can be interpreted as cohomology groups (compare Poincaré duality) and have a multiplication called the intersection product.  The Chow groups carry rich information about an algebraic variety, and they are correspondingly hard to compute in general.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Chow_group"}
