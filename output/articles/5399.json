{"title":"Fichera's existence principle","summary":"In mathematics, and particularly in functional analysis, Fichera's existence principle is an existence and uniqueness theorem for solution of functional equations, proved by Gaetano Fichera in 1954.[1] More precisely, given a general vector space V and two linear maps from it onto two Banach spaces, the principle states necessary and sufficient conditions for a linear transformation between the two dual Banach spaces to be invertible for every vector in V.[2]","image":"58fe61351e3531b14043fa2d09e98c2437bd1a6a.svg","url":"Fichera's_existence_principle"}
