{"title":"Adjunction formula","summary":"In mathematics, especially in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds, the adjunction formula relates the canonical bundle of a variety and a hypersurface inside that variety. It is often used to deduce facts about varieties embedded in well-behaved spaces such as projective space or to prove theorems by induction.","image":"0e9730a0ada0426927ff64141eb9f505eca132d4.svg","url":"Adjunction_formula"}
