{"title":"The Geometry of Numbers","summary":"The Geometry of Numbers is a book on the geometry of numbers, an area of mathematics in which the geometry of lattices, repeating sets of points in the plane or higher dimensions, is used to derive results in number theory. It was written by Carl D. Olds, Anneli Cahn Lax, and Giuliana Davidoff, and published by the Mathematical Association of America in 2000 as volume 41 of their Anneli Lax New Mathematical Library book series.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"The_Geometry_of_Numbers"}
