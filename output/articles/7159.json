{"title":"Hexagonal lattice","summary":"The hexagonal lattice (sometimes called triangular lattice) is one of the five two-dimensional Bravais lattice types.[1] The symmetry category of the lattice is wallpaper group p6m. The primitive translation vectors of the hexagonal lattice form an angle of 120Â° and are of equal lengths,","image":"522dff216435c4f4a94a347322c2af9cdfcdbd13.svg","url":"Hexagonal_lattice"}
