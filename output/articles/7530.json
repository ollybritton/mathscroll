{"title":"Hyperoperation","summary":"In mathematics, the hyperoperation sequence [nb 1] is an infinite sequence of arithmetic operations (called hyperoperations in this context)[1][11][13] that starts with a unary operation (the successor function with n = 0). The sequence continues with the binary operations of addition (n = 1), multiplication (n = 2), and exponentiation (n = 3).","image":"2b5b37b38e6798ec67d72e429a051aa7641fb571.svg","url":"Hyperoperation"}
