{"title":"Euler class","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in algebraic topology, the Euler class is a characteristic class of oriented, real vector bundles. Like other characteristic classes, it measures how \"twisted\" the vector bundle is. In the case of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold, it generalizes the classical notion of Euler characteristic.  It is named after Leonhard Euler because of this.","image":"4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b.svg","url":"Euler_class"}
