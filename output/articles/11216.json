{"title":"Normal crossing singularity","summary":"In algebraic geometry a normal crossing singularity is a singularity similar to a union of coordinate hyperplanes. The term can be confusing because normal crossing singularities are not usually normal schemes (in the sense of the local rings being integrally closed).","image":"ea028c391bca1286dd32dc693f5b2568a1d3647a.svg","url":"Normal_crossing_singularity"}
