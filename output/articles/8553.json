{"title":"Kac's lemma","summary":"In ergodic theory, Kac's lemma, demonstrated by mathematician Mark Kac in 1947,[1] is a lemma stating that in a measure space the orbit of almost all the points contained in a set A {\\displaystyle A} of such space, whose measure is μ ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\mu (A)} , return to A {\\displaystyle A} within an average time inversely proportional to μ ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\mu (A)} .[2]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Kac's_lemma"}
