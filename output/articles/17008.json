{"title":"Wold's decomposition","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in operator theory, Wold decomposition or Woldâ€“von Neumann decomposition, named after Herman Wold and John von Neumann, is a classification theorem for isometric linear operators on a given Hilbert space. It states that every isometry is a direct sum of copies of the unilateral shift and a unitary operator.","image":"80a659faaef5916c7ce750bfd8c16a00f11984c2.svg","url":"Wold's_decomposition"}
