{"title":"Orthogonalization","summary":"In linear algebra, orthogonalization is the process of finding a set of orthogonal vectors that span a particular subspace.  Formally, starting with a linearly independent set of vectors {v1, ... , vk} in an inner product space (most commonly the Euclidean space Rn), orthogonalization results in a set of orthogonal vectors {u1, ... , uk} that generate the same subspace as the vectors v1, ... , vk.  Every vector in the new set is orthogonal to every other vector in the new set; and the new set and the old set have the same linear span.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Orthogonalization"}
