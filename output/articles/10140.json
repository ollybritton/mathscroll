{"title":"Matrix coefficient","summary":"In mathematics, a matrix coefficient (or matrix element) is a function on a group of a special form, which depends on a linear representation of the group and additional data. Precisely, it is a function on a compact topological group G obtained by composing a representation of G on a vector space V with a linear map from the endomorphisms of V into V 's underlying field. It is also called a representative function.[1] They arise naturally from finite-dimensional representations of G as the matrix-entry functions of the corresponding matrix representations. The Peterâ€“Weyl theorem says that the matrix coefficients on G are dense in the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on G.","image":"c143686c15aa32d65b0e2661f1eae3680d00f04c.svg","url":"Matrix_coefficient"}
