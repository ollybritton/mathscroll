{"title":"Valiant–Vazirani theorem","summary":"The Valiant–Vazirani theorem is a theorem in computational complexity theory stating that if there is a polynomial time algorithm for Unambiguous-SAT, then NP = RP.  It was proven by Leslie Valiant and Vijay Vazirani in their paper titled NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions published in 1986.[1] The proof is based on the Mulmuley–Vazirani–Vazirani isolation lemma, which was subsequently used for a number of important applications in theoretical computer science.","image":"d1aad4d6ea4a7354aa049ce332604fd9efbff0bd.svg","url":"Valiant–Vazirani_theorem"}
