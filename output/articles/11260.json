{"title":"Nu-transform","summary":"In the theory of stochastic processes, a ν-transform is an operation that transforms a measure or a point process into a different point process. Intuitively the ν-transform randomly relocates the points of the point process, with the type of relocation being dependent on the position of each point.","image":"73d31468dba98fabc9542edf69cae6d3362a3ac3.svg","url":"Nu-transform"}
