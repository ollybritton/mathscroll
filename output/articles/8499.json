{"title":"Jung's theorem","summary":"In geometry, Jung's theorem is an inequality between the diameter of a set of points in any Euclidean space and the radius of the minimum enclosing ball of that set. It is named after Heinrich Jung, who first studied this inequality in 1901. Algorithms also exist to solve the smallest-circle problem explicitly.","image":"8e9942644e8b1a01d86249d0804cb5e54c89f240.svg","url":"Jung's_theorem"}
