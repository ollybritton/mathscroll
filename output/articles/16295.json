{"title":"UP (complexity)","summary":"In complexity theory, UP (unambiguous non-deterministic polynomial-time) is the complexity class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time on an unambiguous Turing machine with at most one accepting path for each input. UP contains P and is contained in NP.","image":"0ecf4d91cbb1a1aeedff243182acd8c377e1b156.svg","url":"UP_(complexity)"}
