{"title":"Perfect measure","summary":"In mathematics — specifically, in measure theory — a perfect measure (or, more accurately, a perfect measure space) is one that is \"well-behaved\" in some sense.  Intuitively, a perfect measure μ is one for which, if we consider the pushforward measure on the real line R, then every measurable set is \"μ-approximately a Borel set\".  The notion of perfectness is closely related to tightness of measures:  indeed, in metric spaces, tight measures are always perfect.","image":"66b085f15a630595c63eac40bd12ea951c58df02.svg","url":"Perfect_measure"}
