{"title":"G2-structure","summary":"In differential geometry, a G 2 {\\displaystyle G_{2}} -structure is an important type of G-structure that can be defined on a smooth manifold.  If M is a smooth manifold of dimension seven, then a G2-structure is a reduction of structure group of the frame bundle of M to the compact, exceptional Lie group G2.","image":"645011b0c6933a02f5f7d84624f78220d747427e.svg","url":"G2-structure"}
