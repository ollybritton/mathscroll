{"title":"Kepler triangle","summary":"A Kepler triangle is a special right triangle with edge lengths in geometric progression. The ratio of the progression is φ {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {\\varphi }}} where φ = ( 1 + 5 ) / 2 {\\displaystyle \\varphi =(1+{\\sqrt {5}})/2} is the golden ratio, and the progression can be written: 1 : φ : φ {\\displaystyle 1:{\\sqrt {\\varphi }}:\\varphi } , or approximately 1 : 1.272 : 1.618 {\\displaystyle 1:1.272:1.618} . Squares on the edges of this triangle have areas in another geometric progression, 1 : φ : φ 2 {\\displaystyle 1:\\varphi :\\varphi ^{2}} . Alternative definitions of the same triangle characterize it in terms of the three Pythagorean means of two numbers, or via the inradius of isosceles triangles.","image":"ae1094106c2237fda1e1d4f9e6e1bde3e464637b.svg","url":"Kepler_triangle"}
