{"title":"Lowest common ancestor","summary":"In graph theory and computer science, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) (also called least common ancestor) of two nodes v and w in a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG)  T is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both v and w as descendants, where we define each node to be a descendant of itself (so if v has a direct connection from w, w is the lowest common ancestor).","image":"Lowest_common_ancestor.svg.png.webp","url":"Lowest_common_ancestor"}
