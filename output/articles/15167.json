{"title":"Structure constants","summary":"In mathematics, the structure constants or structure coefficients of an algebra over a field are used to explicitly specify the product of two basis vectors in the algebra as a linear combination. Given the structure constants, the resulting product is bilinear and can be uniquely extended to all vectors in the vector space, thus uniquely determining the product for the algebra.","image":"Vecteurs_produit_vectoriel.png.webp","url":"Structure_constants"}
