{"title":"Parallel transport","summary":"In geometry, parallel transport (or parallel translation[lower-alpha 1]) is a way of transporting geometrical data along smooth curves in a manifold.  If the manifold is equipped with an affine connection (a covariant derivative or connection on the tangent bundle), then this connection allows one to transport vectors of the manifold along curves so that they stay parallel with respect to the connection.","image":"Parallel_Transport.svg.png.webp","url":"Parallel_transport"}
