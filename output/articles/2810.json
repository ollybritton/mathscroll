{"title":"Cobham's thesis","summary":"Cobham's thesis, also known as Cobhamâ€“Edmonds thesis (named after Alan Cobham and Jack Edmonds),[1][2][3] asserts that computational problems can be feasibly computed on some computational device only if they can be computed in polynomial time; that is, if they lie in the complexity class P.[4] In modern terms, it identifies tractable problems with the complexity class P.","image":"KnapsackEmpComplexity.GIF","url":"Cobham's_thesis"}
