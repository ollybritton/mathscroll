{"title":"Newton polytope","summary":"In mathematics, the Newton polytope is an integral polytope associated with a multivariate polynomial. It can be used to analyze the polynomial's behavior when specific variables are considered negligible relative to the others.  Specifically, given a vector x = ( x 1 , â€¦ , x n ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} =(x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n})} of variables and a finite family ( a k ) k {\\displaystyle (\\mathbf {a} _{k})_{k}} of pairwise distinct vectors from N n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {N} ^{n}} each encoding the exponents within a monomial, consider the multivariate polynomial","image":"4ba26911a84d2e1f83ef34ba5c0488fc67cf33a3.svg","url":"Newton_polytope"}
