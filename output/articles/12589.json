{"title":"Progressively measurable process","summary":"In mathematics, progressive measurability is a property in the theory of stochastic processes. A progressively measurable process, while defined quite technically, is important because it implies the stopped process is measurable. Being progressively measurable is a strictly stronger property than the notion of being an adapted process.[1] Progressively measurable processes are important in the theory of It√¥ integrals.","image":"6bb8743f7565082ed1a9ee0490d9d71be82eafaa.svg","url":"Progressively_measurable_process"}
