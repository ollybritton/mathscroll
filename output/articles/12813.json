{"title":"Quadratic function","summary":"In mathematics, a quadratic polynomial is a polynomial of degree two in one or more variables. A quadratic function is the polynomial function defined by a quadratic polynomial. Before 20th century, the distinction was unclear between a polynomial and its associated polynomial function; so \"quadratic polynomial\" and \"quadratic function\" were almost synonymous. This is still the case in many elementary courses, where both terms are often abbreviated as \"quadratic\".","image":"Polynomialdeg2.svg.png.webp","url":"Quadratic_function"}
