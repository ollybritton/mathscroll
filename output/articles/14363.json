{"title":"Signature operator","summary":"In mathematics, the signature operator is an elliptic differential operator defined on a certain subspace of the space of differential forms on an even-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold, whose analytic index is the same as the topological signature of the manifold if the dimension of the manifold is a multiple of four.[1] It is an instance of a Dirac-type operator.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Signature_operator"}
