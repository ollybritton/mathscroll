{"title":"Triangulated category","summary":"In mathematics, a triangulated category is a category with the additional structure of a \"translation functor\" and a class of \"exact triangles\". Prominent examples are the derived category of an abelian category, as well as the stable homotopy category. The exact triangles generalize the short exact sequences in an abelian category, as well as fiber sequences and cofiber sequences in topology.","image":"9e1f558f53cda207614abdf90162266c70bc5c1e.svg","url":"Triangulated_category"}
