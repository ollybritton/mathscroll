{"title":"Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols","summary":"Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols is a Unicode block comprising styled forms of Latin and Greek letters and decimal digits that enable mathematicians to denote different notions with different letter styles. The letters in various fonts often have specific, fixed meanings in particular areas of mathematics. By providing uniformity over numerous mathematical articles and books, these conventions help to read mathematical formulas. These also may be used to differentiate between concepts that share a letter in a single problem.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols"}
