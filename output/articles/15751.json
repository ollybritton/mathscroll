{"title":"Thom–Mather stratified space","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, an abstract stratified space, or a Thom–Mather stratified space is a topological space X that has been decomposed into pieces called strata; these strata are manifolds and are required to fit together in a certain way. Thom–Mather stratified spaces provide a purely topological setting for the study of singularities analogous to the more differential-geometric theory of Whitney.  They were introduced by René Thom, who showed that every Whitney stratified space was also a topologically stratified space, with the same strata. Another proof was given by John Mather in 1970, inspired by Thom's proof.","image":"151f552042c5639f9260432073df0c092a44cd45.svg","url":"Thom–Mather_stratified_space"}
