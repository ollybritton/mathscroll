{"title":"Hyperboloid","summary":"In geometry, a hyperboloid of revolution, sometimes called a circular hyperboloid, is the surface generated by rotating a hyperbola around one of its principal axes. A hyperboloid is the surface obtained from a hyperboloid of revolution by deforming it by means of directional scalings, or more generally, of an affine transformation.","image":"Hyperboloid1.png.webp","url":"Hyperboloid"}
