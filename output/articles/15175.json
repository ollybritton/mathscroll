{"title":"Sturmian word","summary":"In mathematics, a Sturmian word (Sturmian sequence or billiard sequence[1]), named after Jacques Charles Fran√ßois Sturm, is a certain kind of infinitely long sequence of characters. Such a sequence can be generated by considering a game of English billiards on a square table. The struck ball will successively hit the vertical and horizontal edges labelled 0 and 1 generating a sequence of letters.[2] This sequence is a Sturmian word.","image":"Fibonacci_word_cutting_sequence.png.webp","url":"Sturmian_word"}
