{"title":"Supergroup (physics)","summary":"The concept of supergroup is a generalization of that of group. In other words, every supergroup carries a natural group structure, but there may be more than one way to structure a given group as a supergroup. A supergroup is like a Lie group in that there is a well defined notion of smooth function defined on them. However the functions may have even and odd parts. Moreover, a supergroup has a super Lie algebra which plays a role similar to that of a Lie algebra for Lie groups in that they determine most of the representation theory and which is the starting point for classification.","image":"de8cfbb602c2707de5e5dd76a9761a8b63958a3b.svg","url":"Supergroup_(physics)"}
