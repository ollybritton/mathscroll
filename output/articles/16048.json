{"title":"Triangulation (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a triangulation is a subdivision of a planar object into triangles, and by extension the subdivision of a higher-dimension geometric object into simplices. Triangulations of a three-dimensional volume would involve subdividing it into tetrahedra packed together.","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Triangulation_(geometry)"}
