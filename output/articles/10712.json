{"title":"Morley–Wang–Xu element","summary":"In applied mathematics, the Morlely–Wang–Xu (MWX) element[1] is a canonical construction of a family of piecewise polynomials with the minimal degree elements for any 2 m {\\displaystyle 2m} -th order of elliptic and parabolic equations in any spatial-dimension R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} for 1 ≤ m ≤ n {\\displaystyle 1\\leq m\\leq n} . The MWX element provides a consistent approximation of Sobolev space H m {\\displaystyle H^{m}} in R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} .","image":"70e100f32f96dc84bf0591df4f5c5bd40d71189f.svg","url":"Morley–Wang–Xu_element"}
