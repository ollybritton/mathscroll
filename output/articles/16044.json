{"title":"Triangular tiling","summary":"In geometry, the triangular tiling or triangular tessellation is one of the three regular tilings of the Euclidean plane, and is the only such tiling where the constituent shapes are not parallelogons. Because the internal angle of the equilateral triangle is 60 degrees, six triangles at a point occupy a full 360 degrees. The triangular tiling has Schl√§fli symbol of {3,6}.","image":"Tiling_3_simple.svg.png.webp","url":"Triangular_tiling"}
