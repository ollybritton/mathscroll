{"title":"Tukey depth","summary":"In statistics and computational geometry, the Tukey depth [1] is a measure of the depth of a point in a fixed set of points. The concept is named after its inventor, John Tukey. Given a set of n points X n = { X 1 , … , X n } {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {X}}_{n}=\\{X_{1},\\dots ,X_{n}\\}} in d-dimensional space, Tukey's depth of a point x is the smallest fraction (or number) of points in any closed halfspace that contains x.","image":"181c8df734133a8b99deace727f818d4bd8c98d0.svg","url":"Tukey_depth"}
