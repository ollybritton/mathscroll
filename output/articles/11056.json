{"title":"Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia","summary":"Nicolo known as Tartaglia (Italian: [tarˈtaʎʎa]; 1499/1500 – 13 December 1557), was an Italian mathematician, engineer (designing fortifications), a surveyor (of topography, seeking the best means of defense or offense) and a bookkeeper from the then Republic of Venice. He published many books, including the first Italian translations of Archimedes and Euclid, and an acclaimed compilation of mathematics. Tartaglia was the first to apply mathematics to the investigation of the paths of cannonballs, known as ballistics, in his Nova Scientia (A New Science, 1537); his work was later partially validated and partially superseded by Galileo's studies on falling bodies. He also published a treatise on retrieving sunken ships.","image":"Portret_van_Niccolo_Tartaglia_Nicolavs_Tartaglia_Brixianvs_(titel_op_object)_Portretten_van_beroemde_Europese_geleerden_(serietitel)_Virorum_doctorum_de_Disciplinis_benemerentium_effigies_(serietitel)%2C_RP-P-1909-4459.jpg.webp","url":"Niccolò_Fontana_Tartaglia"}
