{"title":"Fredholm operator","summary":"In mathematics, Fredholm operators are certain operators that arise in the Fredholm theory of integral equations. They are named in honour of Erik Ivar Fredholm. By definition, a Fredholm operator is a bounded linear operator T : X → Y between two Banach spaces with finite-dimensional kernel ker ⁡ T {\\displaystyle \\ker T} and finite-dimensional (algebraic) cokernel c o k e r T = Y / r a n T {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {coker} \\,T=Y/\\mathrm {ran} \\,T} , and with closed range r a n T {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {ran} \\,T} . The last condition is actually redundant.[1]","image":"9f443e9efd44e1389cf607f81c2e74916439d45a.svg","url":"Fredholm_operator"}
