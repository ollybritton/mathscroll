{"title":"Reflexive space","summary":"In the area of mathematics known as functional analysis, a reflexive space is a locally convex topological vector space (TVS) for which the canonical evaluation map from X {\\displaystyle X} into its bidual (which is the strong dual of the strong dual of X {\\displaystyle X} ) is an isomorphism of TVSs. Since a normable TVS is reflexive if and only if it is semi-reflexive, every normed space (and so in particular, every Banach space) X {\\displaystyle X} is reflexive if and only if the canonical evaluation map from X {\\displaystyle X} into its bidual is surjective; in this case the normed space is necessarily also a Banach space. In 1951, R. C. James discovered a Banach space, now known as James' space, that is not reflexive but is nevertheless isometrically isomorphic to its bidual (any such isomorphism is thus necessarily not the canonical evaluation map).","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Reflexive_space"}
