{"title":"Graph homology","summary":"In algebraic topology and graph theory, graph homology describes the homology groups of a graph, where the graph is considered as a topological space. It formalizes the idea of the number of \"holes\" in the graph. It is a special case of a simplicial homology, as a graph is a special case of a simplicial complex. Since a finite graph is a 1-complex (i.e., its 'faces' are the vertices - which are 0-dimensional, and the edges - which are 1-dimensional), the only non-trivial homology groups are the 0-th group and the 1-th group.[1]","image":"cd7b738bfb8d46e39154cf2e8095b1e42137a6c1.svg","url":"Graph_homology"}
