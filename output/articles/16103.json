{"title":"Tropical compactification","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a tropical compactification is a compactification (projective completion) of a subvariety of an algebraic torus, introduced by Jenia Tevelev.[1][2] Given an algebraic torus and a connected closed subvariety of that torus, a compactification of the subvariety is defined as a closure of it in a toric variety of the original torus. The concept of a tropical compactification arises when trying to make compactifications as \"nice\" as possible. For a torus T {\\displaystyle T} , a toric variety P {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} } , the compatification X Â¯ {\\displaystyle {\\bar {X}}} is tropical when the map","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Tropical_compactification"}
