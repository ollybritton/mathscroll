{"title":"Orbital integral","summary":"In mathematics, an orbital integral is an integral transform that generalizes the spherical mean operator to homogeneous spaces.  Instead of integrating over spheres, one integrates over generalized spheres: for a homogeneous space X = G/H, a generalized sphere centered at a point x0 is an orbit of the isotropy group of x0.","image":"0318cd5a4621092ae16783f171b6865704814e2e.svg","url":"Orbital_integral"}
