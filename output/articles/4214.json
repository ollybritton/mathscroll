{"title":"Dirichlet distribution","summary":"In probability and statistics, the Dirichlet distribution (after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet), often denoted Dir ⁡ ( α ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Dir} ({\\boldsymbol {\\alpha }})} , is a family of continuous multivariate probability distributions parameterized by a vector α {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {\\alpha }}} of positive reals. It is a multivariate generalization of the beta distribution,[1] hence its alternative name of multivariate beta distribution (MBD).[2]  Dirichlet distributions are commonly used as prior distributions in Bayesian statistics, and in fact, the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution and multinomial distribution.","image":"e802b27e52003da9b0c8e276de36339411b40684.svg","url":"Dirichlet_distribution"}
