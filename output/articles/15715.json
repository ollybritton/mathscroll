{"title":"Third fundamental form","summary":"In differential geometry, the third fundamental form is a surface metric denoted by I I I {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {I\\!I\\!I} } .  Unlike the second fundamental form, it is independent of the surface normal.","image":"347e326b3de5caf746fc7b727fade1eb605f9b43.svg","url":"Third_fundamental_form"}
