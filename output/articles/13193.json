{"title":"Realizability","summary":"In mathematical logic, realizability is a collection of methods in proof theory used to study constructive proofs and extract additional information from them.[1] Formulas from a formal theory are \"realized\" by objects, known as \"realizers\", in a way that knowledge of the realizer gives knowledge about the truth of the formula. There are many variations of realizability; exactly which class of formulas is studied and which objects are realizers differ from one variation to another.","image":"7d76e8589396294cbb86639cdfab948659a9ae1a.svg","url":"Realizability"}
