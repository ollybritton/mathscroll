{"title":"Grötzsch graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Grötzsch graph is a triangle-free graph with 11 vertices, 20 edges, chromatic number 4, and crossing number 5. It is named after German mathematician Herbert Grötzsch, who used it as an example in connection with his 1959 theorem that planar triangle-free graphs are 3-colorable.[1]","image":"Groetzsch-graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Grötzsch_graph"}
