{"title":"Modular lambda function","summary":"In mathematics, the modular lambda function λ(τ)[note 1] is a highly symmetric holomorphic function on the complex upper half-plane.  It is invariant under the fractional linear action of the congruence group Γ(2), and generates the function field of the corresponding quotient, i.e., it is a Hauptmodul for the modular curve X(2).  Over any point τ, its value can be described as a cross ratio of the branch points of a ramified double cover of the projective line by the elliptic curve C / ⟨ 1 , τ ⟩ {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} /\\langle 1,\\tau \\rangle } , where the map is defined as the quotient by the [−1] involution.","image":"204eaf43c1293995191eadc9ec0dccf04b684238.svg","url":"Modular_lambda_function"}
