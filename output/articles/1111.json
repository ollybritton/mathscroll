{"title":"Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem, proven by Michael Atiyah and Raoul Bott in the 1960s, is a general form of the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem for smooth manifolds M, which uses an elliptic complex on M. This is a system of elliptic differential operators on vector bundles, generalizing the de Rham complex constructed from smooth differential forms which appears in the original Lefschetz fixed-point theorem.","image":"5a6b8deb5dbdf1b24dff24c985dcbd9e44b13066.svg","url":"Atiyah–Bott_fixed-point_theorem"}
