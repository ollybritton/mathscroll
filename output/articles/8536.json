{"title":"k-synchronized sequence","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical computer science, a k-synchronized sequence is an infinite sequence of terms s(n) characterized by a finite automaton taking as input two strings m and n, each expressed in some fixed base k, and accepting if m = s(n). The class of k-synchronized sequences lies between the classes of k-automatic sequences and k-regular sequences.","image":"7e27db0f230817be427af0329c7fbade2fb2c6b9.svg","url":"K-synchronized_sequence"}
