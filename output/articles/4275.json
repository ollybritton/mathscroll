{"title":"Disintegration theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the disintegration theorem is a result in measure theory and probability theory. It rigorously defines the idea of a non-trivial \"restriction\" of a measure to a measure zero subset of the measure space in question. It is related to the existence of conditional probability measures. In a sense, \"disintegration\" is the opposite process to the construction of a product measure.","image":"e77e61e0972b4a20df26847ef37776a7788462ef.svg","url":"Disintegration_theorem"}
