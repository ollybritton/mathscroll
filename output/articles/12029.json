{"title":"Permanent (mathematics)","summary":"In linear algebra, the permanent of a square matrix is a function of the matrix similar to the determinant. The permanent, as well as the determinant, is a polynomial in the entries of the matrix.[1] Both are special cases of a more general function of a matrix called the immanant.","image":"59e1456b381e82b003ec3ac6514b49ea9d6d984d.svg","url":"Permanent_(mathematics)"}
