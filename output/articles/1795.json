{"title":"Body of constant brightness","summary":"In convex geometry, a body of constant brightness is a three-dimensional convex set all of whose two-dimensional projections have equal area. A sphere is a body of constant brightness, but others exist. Bodies of constant brightness are a generalization of curves of constant width, but are not the same as another generalization, the surfaces of constant width.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Body_of_constant_brightness"}
