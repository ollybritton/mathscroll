{"title":"A¹ homotopy theory","summary":"In algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, branches of mathematics, A1 homotopy theory or motivic homotopy theory is a way to apply the techniques of algebraic topology, specifically homotopy, to algebraic varieties and, more generally, to schemes.  The theory is due to Fabien Morel and Vladimir Voevodsky.  The underlying idea is that it should be possible to develop a purely algebraic approach to homotopy theory by replacing the unit interval [0, 1], which is not an algebraic variety, with the affine line A1, which is.  The theory has seen spectacular applications such as Voevodsky's construction of the derived category of mixed motives and the proof of the Milnor and Bloch-Kato conjectures.","image":"ef2f181a348d25016eca5434e71b2bc5e7804594.svg","url":"A¹_homotopy_theory"}
