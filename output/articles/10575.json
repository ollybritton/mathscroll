{"title":"Model complete theory","summary":"In model theory, a first-order theory is called model complete if every embedding of its models is an elementary embedding. Equivalently, every first-order formula is equivalent to a universal formula. This notion was introduced by Abraham Robinson.","image":"721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1.svg","url":"Model_complete_theory"}
