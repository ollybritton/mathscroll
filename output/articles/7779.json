{"title":"Infinitesimal transformation","summary":"In mathematics, an infinitesimal transformation is a limiting form of small transformation. For example one may talk about an infinitesimal rotation of a rigid body, in three-dimensional space. This is conventionally represented by a 3×3 skew-symmetric matrix A. It is not the matrix of an actual rotation in space; but for small real values of a parameter ε the transformation","image":"a022387e61e05fed4e154b10b78111445de04ef3.svg","url":"Infinitesimal_transformation"}
