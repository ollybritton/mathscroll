{"title":"Randomness extractor","summary":"A randomness extractor, often simply called an \"extractor\", is a function, which being applied to output from a weakly random entropy source, together with a short, uniformly random seed, generates a highly random output that appears independent from the source and uniformly distributed.[1]  Examples of weakly random sources include radioactive decay or thermal noise; the only restriction on possible sources is that there is no way they can be fully controlled, calculated or predicted, and that a lower bound on their entropy rate can be established.  For a given source, a randomness extractor can even be considered to be a true random number generator (TRNG); but there is no single extractor that has been proven to produce truly random output from any type of weakly random source.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Randomness_extractor"}
