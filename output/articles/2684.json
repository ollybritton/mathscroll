{"title":"Circumscribed sphere","summary":"In geometry, a circumscribed sphere of a polyhedron is a sphere that contains the polyhedron and touches each of the polyhedron's vertices.[1]  The word circumsphere is sometimes used to mean the same thing, by analogy with the term circumcircle.[2] As in the case of two-dimensional circumscribed circles (circumcircles), the radius of a sphere circumscribed around a polyhedron P is called the circumradius of P,[3] and the center point of this sphere is called the circumcenter of P.[4]","image":"Вписанный_куб.gif","url":"Circumscribed_sphere"}
