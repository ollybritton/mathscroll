{"title":"Minimum degree algorithm","summary":"In numerical analysis, the minimum degree algorithm is an algorithm used to permute the rows and columns of a symmetric sparse matrix before applying the Cholesky decomposition, to reduce the number of non-zeros in the Cholesky factor. This results in reduced storage requirements and means that the Cholesky factor can be applied with fewer arithmetic operations. (Sometimes it may also pertain to an incomplete Cholesky factor used as a preconditionerâ€”for example, in the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm.)","image":"c1688bdcfe95659c92f6452378ee805da3f796c8.svg","url":"Minimum_degree_algorithm"}
