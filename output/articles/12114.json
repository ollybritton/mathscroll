{"title":"Phase-space formulation","summary":"The phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics places the position and momentum variables on equal footing in phase space. In contrast, the Schr√∂dinger picture uses the position or momentum representations (see also position and momentum space).  The two key features of the phase-space formulation are that the quantum state is described by a quasiprobability distribution (instead of a wave function, state vector, or density matrix) and operator multiplication is replaced by a star product.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg","url":"Phase-space_formulation"}
