{"title":"Positive and negative predictive values","summary":"The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV respectively) are the proportions of positive and negative results in statistics and diagnostic tests that are true positive and true negative results, respectively.[1]  The PPV and NPV describe the performance of a diagnostic test or other statistical measure. A high result can be interpreted as indicating the accuracy of such a statistic. The PPV and NPV are not intrinsic to the test (as true positive rate and true negative rate are); they depend also on the prevalence.[2] Both PPV and NPV can be derived using Bayes' theorem.","image":"page1-541px-Positive_and_negative_predictive_values.pdf.jpg.webp","url":"Positive_and_negative_predictive_values"}
