{"title":"Walk-on-spheres method","summary":"In mathematics, the walk-on-spheres method (WoS) is a numerical probabilistic algorithm, or Monte-Carlo method, used mainly in order to approximate the solutions of some specific boundary value problem for partial differential equations (PDEs).[1][2] The WoS method was first introduced by Mervin E. Muller in 1956 to solve Laplace's equation,[1] and was since then generalized to other problems.","image":"24b0d5ca6f381068d756f6337c08e0af9d1eeb6f.svg","url":"Walk-on-spheres_method"}
