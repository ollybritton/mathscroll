{"title":"Pseudo-zero set","summary":"In complex analysis (a branch of mathematical analysis), the pseudo-zero set or root neighborhood of a degree-m polynomial p(z) is the set of all complex numbers that are roots of polynomials whose coefficients differ from those of p by a small amount. Namely, given a norm |·| on the space C m + 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{m+1}} of polynomial coefficients, the pseudo-zero set is the set of all zeros of all degree-m polynomials q such that |p − q| (as vectors of coefficients) is less than a given ε.","image":"6478d3bcf8f89e503541f2aed6714faa549e30db.svg","url":"Pseudo-zero_set"}
