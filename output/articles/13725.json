{"title":"Rotation system","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, rotation systems (also called combinatorial embeddings or combinatorial maps) encode embeddings of graphs onto orientable surfaces by describing the circular ordering of a graph's edges around each vertex. A more formal definition of a rotation system involves pairs of permutations; such a pair is sufficient to determine a multigraph, a surface, and a 2-cell embedding of the multigraph onto the surface.","image":"34f8fbf01ae59456413308bf5368adc2f61b1a88.svg","url":"Rotation_system"}
