{"title":"Orthogonal wavelet","summary":"An orthogonal wavelet is a wavelet whose associated wavelet transform is orthogonal. That is, the inverse wavelet transform is the adjoint of the wavelet transform. If this condition is weakened one may end up with biorthogonal wavelets.","image":"713f1c137a06084230c6ec2221451ee8d2f6eadd.svg","url":"Orthogonal_wavelet"}
