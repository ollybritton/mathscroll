{"title":"Log structure","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a log structure provides an abstract context to study semistable schemes, and in particular the notion of logarithmic differential form and the related Hodge-theoretic concepts. This idea has applications in the theory of moduli spaces, in deformation theory and Fontaine's p-adic Hodge theory, among others.","image":"9fed6a46b79218af44f23e5d6f487fb7e0d6cd01.svg","url":"Log_structure"}
