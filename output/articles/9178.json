{"title":"Leibniz operator","summary":"In abstract algebraic logic, a branch of mathematical logic, the Leibniz operator is a tool used to classify deductive systems, which have a precise technical definition and capture a large number of logics. The Leibniz operator was introduced by Wim Blok and Don Pigozzi, two of the founders of the field, as a means to abstract the well-known Lindenbaumâ€“Tarski process, that leads to the association of Boolean algebras to classical propositional calculus, and make it applicable to as wide a variety of sentential logics as possible. It is an operator that assigns to a given theory of a given sentential logic, perceived as a term algebra with a consequence operation on its universe, the largest congruence on the algebra that is compatible with the theory.","image":"e6013658c868751fa15170b0544b6f857e325fbb.svg","url":"Leibniz_operator"}
