{"title":"Independence complex","summary":"The independence complex of a graph is a mathematical object describing the independent sets of the graph. Formally, the independence complex of an undirected graph G, denoted by I(G), is an abstract simplicial complex (that is, a family of finite sets closed under the operation of taking subsets), formed by the sets of vertices in the independent sets of G. Any subset of an independent set  is itself an independent set, so I(G) is indeed closed under taking subsets.","image":"855dd207a2f98c42ed91388072f8c30ab107197f.svg","url":"Independence_complex"}
