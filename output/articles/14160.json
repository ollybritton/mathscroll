{"title":"Separable extension","summary":"In field theory, a branch of algebra, an algebraic field extension E / F {\\displaystyle E/F} is called a separable extension if for every α ∈ E {\\displaystyle \\alpha \\in E} , the minimal polynomial of α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } over F is a separable polynomial (i.e., its formal derivative is not the zero polynomial, or equivalently it has no repeated roots in any extension field).[1]  There is also a more general definition that applies when E is not necessarily algebraic over F.  An extension that is not separable is said to be inseparable.","image":"f86227a53670608bf39758bc69a4529774756b64.svg","url":"Separable_extension"}
