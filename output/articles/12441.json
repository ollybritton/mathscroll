{"title":"Powerful p-group","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of group theory, especially in the study of p-groups and pro-p-groups, the concept of powerful p-groups plays an important role.  They were introduced in (Lubotzky & Mann 1987), where a number of applications are given, including results on Schur multipliers.  Powerful p-groups are used in the study of automorphisms of p-groups (Khukhro 1998), the solution of the restricted Burnside problem (Vaughan-Lee 1993), the classification of finite p-groups via the coclass conjectures (Leedham-Green & McKay 2002), and provided an excellent method of understanding analytic pro-p-groups (Dixon et al. 1991).","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Powerful_p-group"}
