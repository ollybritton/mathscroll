{"title":"Modular group","summary":"In mathematics, the modular group  is the projective special linear group PSL ⁡ ( 2 , Z ) {\\textstyle \\operatorname {PSL} (2,\\mathbb {Z} )} of 2 × 2 matrices with integer coefficients and determinant 1. The matrices A and −A are identified. The modular group acts on the upper-half of the complex plane by fractional linear transformations, and the name \"modular group\" comes from the relation to moduli spaces and not from modular arithmetic.","image":"74e5b7e13b2cf66a1d772d163e0a321ffe5543b6.svg","url":"Modular_group"}
