{"title":"Constructible function","summary":"In complexity theory, a time-constructible function is a function f from natural numbers to natural numbers with the property that f(n) can be constructed from n by a Turing machine in the time of order f(n). The purpose of such a definition is to exclude functions that do not provide an upper bound on the runtime of some Turing machine.[1]","image":"503f4ab1a3810662c83bccd74b0d966b642a3f1d.svg","url":"Constructible_function"}
