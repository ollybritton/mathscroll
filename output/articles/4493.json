{"title":"Dual object","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a dual object is an analogue of a dual vector space from linear algebra for objects in arbitrary monoidal categories. It is only a partial generalization, based upon the categorical properties of duality for finite-dimensional vector spaces. An object admitting a dual is called a dualizable object. In this formalism, infinite-dimensional vector spaces are not dualizable, since the dual vector space Vâˆ— doesn't satisfy the axioms.[1] Often, an object is dualizable only when it satisfies some finiteness or compactness property.[2]","image":"8cafb86d0f3d64525bf9821642e6050c575981c5.svg","url":"Dual_object"}
