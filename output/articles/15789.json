{"title":"Tilting theory","summary":"In mathematics, specifically representation theory, tilting theory describes a way to relate the module categories of two algebras using so-called tilting modules and associated tilting functors. Here, the second algebra is the endomorphism algebra of a tilting module over the first algebra.","image":"91bf0e42f0dccd6634acf9683d5a0280e0e13f07.svg","url":"Tilting_theory"}
