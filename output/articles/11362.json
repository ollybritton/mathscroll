{"title":"Ogee","summary":"An ogee (/oʊˈdʒiː/ /ˈoʊdʒiː/) is the name given to objects, elements, and curves—often seen in architecture and building trades—that have been variously described as serpentine-, extended S-,[1]: 218  or sigmoid-shaped. Ogees consist of a \"double curve\", the combination of two semicircular curves or arcs that, as a result of a point of inflection from concave to convex or vice versa,[1]: 218  have ends of the overall curve that point in opposite directions (and have tangents that are approximately parallel).","image":"Ogee-shaped_arch.svg.png.webp","url":"Ogee"}
