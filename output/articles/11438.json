{"title":"Operator ideal","summary":"In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, an operator ideal is a special kind of class of continuous linear operators between Banach spaces.  If an operator T {\\displaystyle T} belongs to an operator ideal J {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {J}}} , then for any operators A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} which can be composed with T {\\displaystyle T} as B T A {\\displaystyle BTA} , then B T A {\\displaystyle BTA} is class J {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {J}}} as well.  Additionally, in order for J {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {J}}} to be an operator ideal, it must contain the class of all finite-rank Banach space operators.","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Operator_ideal"}
