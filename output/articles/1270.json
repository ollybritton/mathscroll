{"title":"Baire one star function","summary":"A Baire one star function is a type of function studied in real analysis. A function f : R → R {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {R} \\to \\mathbb {R} } is in class Baire* one, written f ∈ B 1 ∗ {\\displaystyle f\\in \\mathbf {B} _{1}^{*}} , and is called a Baire one star function, if for each perfect set P ∈ R {\\displaystyle P\\in \\mathbb {R} } , there is an open interval I ∈ R {\\displaystyle I\\in \\mathbb {R} } , such that P ∩ I {\\displaystyle P\\cap I} is nonempty, and the restriction f | P ∩ I {\\displaystyle f|_{P\\cap I}} is continuous. The notion seems to have originated with B. Kirchheim in an article titled 'Baire one star functions' (Real Anal. Exch. 18 (1992/93), 385-399). The terminology is actually due to Richard O'Malley,  'Baire* 1, Darboux functions' Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 60 (1976) 187-192.  The concept itself (under a different name) goes back at least to 1951. See H. W. Ellis, 'Darboux properties and applications to nonabsolutely convergent integrals' Canad. Math. J., 3 (1951), 471-484, where the same concept is labelled as [CG] (for generalized continuity).","image":"1e3a10a3ad05781f5cf9c2d875a02227e21a8448.svg","url":"Baire_one_star_function"}
