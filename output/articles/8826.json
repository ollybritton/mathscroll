{"title":"Koszul duality","summary":"In mathematics, Koszul duality, named after the French mathematician Jean-Louis Koszul, is any of various kinds of dualities found in representation theory of Lie algebras, abstract algebras (semisimple algebra)[1] and topology (e.g., equivariant cohomology[2]). The prototype example, due to Joseph Bernstein, Israel Gelfand, and Sergei Gelfand,[3] is the rough duality between the derived category of a symmetric algebra and that of an exterior algebra. The importance of the notion rests on the suspicion that Koszul duality seems quite ubiquitous in nature.","image":"5910e6a94f4f7ee2ee85ceed9dacef3eff7a6242.svg","url":"Koszul_duality"}
