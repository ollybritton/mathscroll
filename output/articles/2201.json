{"title":"Cantor function","summary":"In mathematics, the Cantor function is an example of a  function that is continuous, but not absolutely continuous. It is a notorious counterexample in analysis, because it challenges naive intuitions about continuity, derivative, and measure. Though it is continuous everywhere and has zero derivative almost everywhere, its value still goes from 0 to 1 as its argument reaches from 0 to 1. Thus, in one sense the function seems very much like a constant one which cannot grow, and in another, it does indeed monotonically grow.","image":"CantorEscalier-2.svg.png.webp","url":"Cantor_function"}
