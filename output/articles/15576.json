{"title":"Tensor product of quadratic forms","summary":"In mathematics, the tensor product of quadratic forms is most easily understood when one views the quadratic forms as quadratic spaces. If R is a commutative ring where 2 is invertible (that is, R has characteristic char ( R ) ≠ 2 {\\displaystyle {\\text{char}}(R)\\neq 2} ), and if ( V 1 , q 1 ) {\\displaystyle (V_{1},q_{1})} and ( V 2 , q 2 ) {\\displaystyle (V_{2},q_{2})} are two quadratic spaces over R, then their tensor product ( V 1 ⊗ V 2 , q 1 ⊗ q 2 ) {\\displaystyle (V_{1}\\otimes V_{2},q_{1}\\otimes q_{2})} is the quadratic space whose underlying R-module is the tensor product V 1 ⊗ V 2 {\\displaystyle V_{1}\\otimes V_{2}} of R-modules and whose quadratic form is the quadratic form associated to the tensor product of the bilinear forms associated to q 1 {\\displaystyle q_{1}} and q 2 {\\displaystyle q_{2}} .","image":"5aa09b52b6114b3c15968a48a0072a047c75ff9e.svg","url":"Tensor_product_of_quadratic_forms"}
