{"title":"Spin(7)-manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a Spin(7)-manifold is an eight-dimensional Riemannian manifold whose holonomy group is contained in Spin(7). Spin(7)-manifolds are Ricci-flat and admit a parallel spinor. They also admit a parallel 4-form, known as the Cayley form, which is a calibrating form for a special class of submanifolds called Cayley cycles.","image":"Calabi-Yau-alternate.png.webp","url":"Spin(7)-manifold"}
