{"title":"Branched flow","summary":"Branched flow refers to a phenomenon in wave dynamics, that produces a tree-like pattern involving successive mostly forward scattering events by smooth obstacles deflecting traveling rays or waves. Sudden and significant momentum or wavevector changes are absent, but accumulated small changes can lead to large momentum changes. The path of a single ray is less important than the environs around a ray, which rotate, compress, and stretch around in an area preserving way. Even more revealing are groups, or manifolds of neighboring rays extending over significant zones. Starting rays out from a point but varying their direction over a range, one to the next, or from different points along a line all with the same initial directions are examples of a manifold. Waves have analogous launching conditions, such as a point source spraying in many directions, or an extended plane wave heading on one direction. The ray bending or refraction leads to characteristic structure in phase space and nonuniform distributions in coordinate space that look somehow universal and resemble branches in trees or stream beds. The branches taken on non-obvious paths through the refracting landscape that are indirect and nonlocal results of terrain already traversed. For a given refracting landscape, the branches will look completely different depending on the initial manifold.","image":"Branchedgifsm.gif","url":"Branched_flow"}
