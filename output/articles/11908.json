{"title":"Paul Seymour (mathematician)","summary":"Paul D. Seymour FRS (born 26 July 1950) is a British mathematician known for his work in discrete mathematics, especially graph theory. He (with others) was responsible for important progress on regular matroids and totally unimodular matrices, the four colour theorem, linkless embeddings, graph minors and structure, the perfect graph conjecture, the Hadwiger conjecture, claw-free graphs, χ-boundedness, and the Erdős–Hajnal conjecture. Many of his recent papers are available from his website.[1]","image":"PaulSeymour2010.jpg.webp","url":"Paul_Seymour_(mathematician)"}
