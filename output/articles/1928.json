{"title":"Braided Hopf algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a braided Hopf algebra is a Hopf algebra in a braided monoidal category. The most common braided Hopf algebras are objects in a Yetterâ€“Drinfeld category of a Hopf algebra H, particularly the Nichols algebra of a braided vector space in that category.","image":"054efd01c5be9190b4a6518152e54fc9435cfd41.svg","url":"Braided_Hopf_algebra"}
