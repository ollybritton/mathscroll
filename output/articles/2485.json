{"title":"Character group","summary":"In mathematics, a character group is the group of representations of a group by  complex-valued functions. These functions can be thought of as one-dimensional matrix representations and so are special cases of the group characters that arise in the related context of character theory. Whenever a group is represented by matrices, the function defined by the trace of the matrices is called a character; however, these traces do not in general form a group. Some important properties of these one-dimensional characters apply to characters in general:","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Character_group"}
