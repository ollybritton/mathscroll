{"title":"Digital root","summary":"The digital root (also repeated digital sum) of a natural number in a given radix is the (single digit) value obtained by an iterative process of summing digits, on each iteration using the result from the previous iteration to compute a digit sum. The process continues until a single-digit number is reached. For example, in base 10, the digital root of the number 12345 is 6 because the sum of the digits in the number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, then the addition process is repeated again for the resulting number 15, so that the sum of 1 + 5 equals 6, which is the digital root of that number. In base 10, this is equivalent to taking the remainder upon division by 9 (except when the digital root is 9, where the remainder upon division by 9 will be 0), which allows it to be used as a divisibility rule.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Digital_root"}
