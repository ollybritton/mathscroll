{"title":"Numbering (computability theory)","summary":"In computability theory a numbering is the assignment of natural numbers to a set of objects such as functions, rational numbers, graphs, or words in some formal language. A numbering can be used to transfer the idea of computability[1] and related concepts, which are originally defined on the natural numbers using computable functions, to these different types of objects.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Numbering_(computability_theory)"}
