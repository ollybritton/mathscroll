{"title":"Expectiminimax","summary":"The expectiminimax algorithm is a variation of the minimax algorithm, for use in artificial intelligence systems that play two-player zero-sum games, such as backgammon, in which the outcome depends on a combination of the player's skill and chance elements such as dice rolls. In addition to \"min\" and \"max\" nodes of the traditional minimax tree, this variant has \"chance\" (\"move by nature\") nodes, which take the expected value of a random event occurring.[1] In game theory terms, an expectiminimax tree is the game tree of an extensive-form game of perfect, but incomplete information.","image":"ee4f8cd292567570519c87728b0b64a484db6a2d.svg","url":"Expectiminimax"}
