{"title":"Order complete","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, a subset A {\\displaystyle A} of an ordered vector space is said to be order complete in X {\\displaystyle X} if for every non-empty subset S {\\displaystyle S} of C {\\displaystyle C} that is order bounded in A {\\displaystyle A} (meaning contained in an interval, which is a set of the form [ a , b ] := { x ∈ X : a ≤ x and x ≤ b } , {\\displaystyle [a,b]:=\\{x\\in X:a\\leq x{\\text{ and }}x\\leq b\\},} for some a , b ∈ A {\\displaystyle a,b\\in A} ), the supremum sup S {\\displaystyle \\sup S} ' and the infimum inf S {\\displaystyle \\inf S} both exist and are elements of A . {\\displaystyle A.} An ordered vector space is called order complete, Dedekind complete, a complete vector lattice, or a complete Riesz space, if it is order complete as a subset of itself,[1][2]  in which case it is necessarily a vector lattice. An ordered vector space is said to be countably order complete if each countable subset that is bounded above has a supremum.[1]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Order_complete"}
