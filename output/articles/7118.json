{"title":"Hermitian symmetric space","summary":"In mathematics, a Hermitian symmetric space is a Hermitian manifold which at every point has an inversion symmetry preserving the Hermitian structure. First studied by Ã‰lie Cartan, they form a natural generalization of the notion of Riemannian symmetric space from real manifolds to complex manifolds.","image":"E8Petrie.svg.png.webp","url":"Hermitian_symmetric_space"}
