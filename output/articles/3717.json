{"title":"Cylindrical coordinate system","summary":"A cylindrical coordinate system is a three-dimensional coordinate system that specifies point positions by the distance from a chosen reference axis (axis L in the image opposite), the direction from the axis relative to a chosen reference direction (axis A), and the distance from a chosen reference plane perpendicular to the axis (plane containing the purple section). The latter distance is given as a positive or negative number depending on which side of the reference plane faces the point.","image":"Coord_system_CY_1.svg.png.webp","url":"Cylindrical_coordinate_system"}
