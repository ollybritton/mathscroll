{"title":"Simplicial presheaf","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in homotopy theory, a simplicial presheaf is a presheaf on a site (e.g., the category of topological spaces) taking values in simplicial sets (i.e., a contravariant functor from the site to the category of simplicial sets). Equivalently, a simplicial presheaf is a simplicial object in the category of presheaves on a site. The notion was introduced by A. Joyal in the 1970s.[1] Similarly, a simplicial sheaf on a site is a simplicial object in the category of sheaves on the site.[2]","image":"dbd08944bc6687a024aaf70554dcd9a8acc3dbcd.svg","url":"Simplicial_presheaf"}
