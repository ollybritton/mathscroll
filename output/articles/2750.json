{"title":"Clifford algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Clifford algebra[lower-alpha 1] is an algebra generated by a vector space with a quadratic form, and is a unital associative algebra. As K-algebras, they generalize the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and several other hypercomplex number systems.[1][2] The theory of Clifford algebras is intimately connected with the theory of quadratic forms and orthogonal transformations. Clifford algebras have important applications in a variety of fields including geometry, theoretical physics and digital image processing. They are named after the English mathematician William Kingdon Clifford (1845 â€“ 1879 ) .","image":"Latex_integers.svg.png.webp","url":"Clifford_algebra"}
