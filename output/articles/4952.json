{"title":"Erdős–Graham problem","summary":"In combinatorial number theory, the Erdős–Graham problem is the problem of proving that, if the set { 2 , 3 , 4 , … } {\\displaystyle \\{2,3,4,\\dots \\}} of integers greater than one is partitioned into finitely many subsets, then one of the subsets can be used to form an Egyptian fraction representation of unity. That is, for every r > 0 {\\displaystyle r>0} , and every r {\\displaystyle r} -coloring of the integers greater than one, there is a finite monochromatic subset S {\\displaystyle S} of these integers such that","image":"f8ea5c6ef19f15c1d2984ce2e9a0bfba73095189.svg","url":"Erdős–Graham_problem"}
