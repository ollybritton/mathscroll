{"title":"Measure-preserving dynamical system","summary":"In mathematics, a measure-preserving dynamical system is an object of study in the abstract formulation of dynamical systems, and ergodic theory in particular. Measure-preserving systems obey the Poincar√© recurrence theorem, and are a special case of conservative systems. They provide the formal, mathematical basis for a broad range of physical systems, and, in particular, many systems from classical mechanics (in particular, most non-dissipative systems) as well as systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.","image":"158447b50601317932c9c3ed4537b75ebb306b01.svg","url":"Measure-preserving_dynamical_system"}
