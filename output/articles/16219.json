{"title":"Tuple","summary":"In mathematics, a tuple is a finite ordered list (sequence) of elements.  An n-tuple is a sequence (or ordered list) of n elements, where n is a non-negative integer. There is only one 0-tuple, referred to as the empty tuple. An n-tuple may be defined inductively using the construction of an ordered pair.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Tuple"}
