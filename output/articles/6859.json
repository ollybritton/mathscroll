{"title":"Hankel contour","summary":"In mathematics, a Hankel contour is a path in the complex plane which extends from (+∞,δ), around the origin counter clockwise and back to (+∞,−δ), where δ is an arbitrarily small positive number. The contour thus remains arbitrarily close to the real axis but without crossing the real axis except for negative values of x. The Hankel contour can also be represented by a path that has mirror images just above and below the real axis, connected to a circle of radius ε, centered at the origin, where ε is an arbitrarily small number. The two linear portions of the contour are said to be a distance of δ from the real axis. Thus, the total distance between the linear portions of the contour is 2δ.[1] The contour is traversed in the positively-oriented sense, meaning that the circle around the origin is traversed counter-clockwise.","image":"Hankel_Pic.png.webp","url":"Hankel_contour"}
