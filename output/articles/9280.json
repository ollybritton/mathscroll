{"title":"Lie superalgebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Lie superalgebra is a generalisation of a Lie algebra to include a Z2â€‘grading. Lie superalgebras are important in theoretical physics where they are used to describe the mathematics of supersymmetry. In most of these theories, the even elements of the superalgebra correspond to bosons and odd elements to fermions (but this is not always true; for example, the BRST supersymmetry is the other way around).","image":"1ab3c82e365ac7b96551441dc0062773492c9532.svg","url":"Lie_superalgebra"}
