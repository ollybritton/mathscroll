{"title":"Representation up to homotopy","summary":"A Representation up to homotopy has several meanings. One of the earliest appeared in the `physical' context of constrained Hamiltonian systems. The essential idea is lifting a non-representation on a quotient to a representation up to strong homotopy on a resolution of the quotient. As a concept in differential geometry, it generalizes the notion of representation of a Lie algebra to Lie algebroids and nontrivial vector bundles. As such, it was introduced by Abad and Crainic.[1]","image":"5c9c4a69ff601441e07e78c3685491de6dc35548.svg","url":"Representation_up_to_homotopy"}
