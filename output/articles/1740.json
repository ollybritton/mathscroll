{"title":"Blade (geometry)","summary":"In the study of geometric algebras, a k-blade or a simple k-vector is a generalization of the concept of scalars and vectors to include simple bivectors, trivectors, etc. Specifically, a k-blade is a k-vector that can be expressed as the exterior product (informally wedge product) of 1-vectors, and is of grade k.","image":"b8899b5542ad2af45659a74de14086528cd4a33b.svg","url":"Blade_(geometry)"}
