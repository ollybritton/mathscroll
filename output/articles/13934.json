{"title":"Schanuel's lemma","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the area of algebra known as module theory, Schanuel's lemma, named after Stephen Schanuel, allows one to compare how far modules depart from being projective.  It is useful in defining the Heller operator in the stable category, and in giving elementary descriptions of dimension shifting.","image":"f21c480c94cf6861e1cb2f271545228300051728.svg","url":"Schanuel's_lemma"}
