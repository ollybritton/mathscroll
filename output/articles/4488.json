{"title":"Dual lattice","summary":"In the theory of lattices, the dual lattice is a construction analogous to that of a dual vector space. In certain respects, the geometry of the dual lattice of a lattice L {\\textstyle L} is the reciprocal of the geometry of L {\\textstyle L} , a perspective which underlies many of its uses.","image":"8fb88de7e4d31737dae8f02575033272f29e6720.svg","url":"Dual_lattice"}
