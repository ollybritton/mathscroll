{"title":"Reflection principle","summary":"In set theory, a branch of mathematics, a reflection principle says that it is possible to find sets that, with respect to any given property, resemble the class of all sets. There are several different forms of the reflection principle depending on exactly what is meant by \"resemble\". Weak forms of the reflection principle are theorems of ZF set theory due to Montague (1961), while stronger forms can be new and very powerful axioms for set theory.","image":"72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4.svg","url":"Reflection_principle"}
