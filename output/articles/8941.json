{"title":"Labelled enumeration theorem","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, the labelled enumeration theorem is the counterpart of the PÃ³lya enumeration theorem for the labelled case, where we have a set of labelled objects given by an exponential generating function (EGF) g(z) which are being distributed into n slots and a permutation group G which permutes the slots, thus creating equivalence classes of configurations. There is a special re-labelling operation that re-labels the objects in the slots, assigning labels from 1 to k, where k is the total number of nodes, i.e. the sum of the number of nodes of the individual objects. The EGF f n ( z ) {\\displaystyle f_{n}(z)} of the number of different configurations under this re-labelling process is given by","image":"f2f5fdab7be398c4706424307a73e4cd345d8c5f.svg","url":"Labelled_enumeration_theorem"}
