{"title":"Jordan–Pólya number","summary":"In mathematics, the Jordan–Pólya numbers are the numbers that can be obtained by multiplying together one or more factorials, not required to be distinct from each other. For instance, 480 {\\displaystyle 480} is a Jordan–Pólya number because 480 = 2 ! ⋅ 2 ! ⋅ 5 ! {\\displaystyle 480=2!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 5!} . Every tree has a number of symmetries that is a Jordan–Pólya number, and every Jordan–Pólya number arises in this way as the order of an automorphism group of a tree. These numbers are named after Camille Jordan and George Pólya, who both wrote about them in the context of symmetries of trees.[1][2]","image":"b49cf74396eea68872374b5bd986e48549af2121.svg","url":"Jordan–Pólya_number"}
