{"title":"Doubly triangular number","summary":"In mathematics, the doubly triangular numbers are the numbers that appear within the sequence of triangular numbers, in positions that are also triangular numbers. That is, if T n = n ( n + 1 ) / 2 {\\displaystyle T_{n}=n(n+1)/2} denotes the n {\\displaystyle n} th triangular number, then the doubly triangular numbers are the numbers of the form T T n {\\displaystyle T_{T_{n}}} .","image":"fd80a7fc3b0830c667ac269a213e23cd27ab75a3.svg","url":"Doubly_triangular_number"}
