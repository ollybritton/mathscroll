{"title":"Monte Carlo integration","summary":"In mathematics, Monte Carlo integration is a technique for numerical integration using random numbers. It is a particular Monte Carlo method that numerically computes a definite integral. While other algorithms usually evaluate the integrand at a regular grid,[1] Monte Carlo randomly chooses points at which the integrand is evaluated.[2] This method is particularly useful for higher-dimensional integrals.[3]","image":"MonteCarloIntegrationCircle.svg.png.webp","url":"Monte_Carlo_integration"}
