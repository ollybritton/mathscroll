{"title":"Real representation","summary":"In the mathematical field of representation theory a real representation is usually a representation on a real vector space U, but it can also mean a representation on a complex vector space V with an invariant real structure, i.e., an antilinear equivariant map","image":"4a2567b94480b1b2bcbc5ade9b01bf71120dcc12.svg","url":"Real_representation"}
