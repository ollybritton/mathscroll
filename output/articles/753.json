{"title":"Analytic torsion","summary":"In mathematics, Reidemeister torsion (or R-torsion, or Reidemeister–Franz torsion) is a topological invariant of manifolds introduced by Kurt Reidemeister (Reidemeister 1935) for 3-manifolds and generalized to higher dimensions by Wolfgang Franz (1935) and Georges de Rham (1936). Analytic torsion (or Ray–Singer torsion) is an invariant of Riemannian manifolds defined by Daniel B. Ray and Isadore M. Singer (1971, 1973a, 1973b) as an analytic analogue of Reidemeister torsion. Jeff Cheeger (1977, 1979) and Werner Müller (1978) proved Ray and Singer's conjecture that Reidemeister torsion and analytic torsion are the same for compact Riemannian manifolds.","image":"3d6e36e07b9587a556de05b249666876b429c59d.svg","url":"Analytic_torsion"}
