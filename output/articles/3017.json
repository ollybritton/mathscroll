{"title":"Complex lamellar vector field","summary":"In vector calculus, a complex lamellar vector field is a vector field which is orthogonal to a family of surfaces. In the broader context of differential geometry, complex lamellar vector fields are more often called hypersurface-orthogonal vector fields. They can be characterized in a number of different ways, many of which involve the curl. A lamellar vector field is a special case given by vector fields with zero curl.","image":"88c82089796acb358f13f35b12c37b17816b09be.svg","url":"Complex_lamellar_vector_field"}
