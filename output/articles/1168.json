{"title":"Automorphism group","summary":"In mathematics, the automorphism group of an object X is the group consisting of automorphisms of X under composition of morphisms.  For example, if X is a finite-dimensional vector space, then the automorphism group of X is the group of invertible linear transformations from X to itself (the general linear group of X).  If instead X is a group, then its automorphism group Aut ‚Å° ( X ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Aut} (X)} is the group consisting of all group automorphisms of X.","image":"7e84ea9d964acce4ed25be1f7b1f8ef8c70bf04f.svg","url":"Automorphism_group"}
