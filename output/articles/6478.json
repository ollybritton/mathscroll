{"title":"Graph of a function","summary":"In mathematics, the graph of a function f {\\displaystyle f} is the set of ordered pairs ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle (x,y)} , where f ( x ) = y . {\\displaystyle f(x)=y.} In the common case where x {\\displaystyle x} and f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} are real numbers, these pairs are Cartesian coordinates of points in two-dimensional space and thus form a subset of this plane.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Graph_of_a_function"}
