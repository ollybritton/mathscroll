{"title":"Zero of a function","summary":"In mathematics, a zero (also sometimes called a root) of a real-, complex-, or generally vector-valued function f {\\displaystyle f} , is a member x {\\displaystyle x} of the domain of f {\\displaystyle f} such that f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} vanishes at x {\\displaystyle x} ; that is, the function f {\\displaystyle f} attains the value of 0 at x {\\displaystyle x} , or equivalently, x {\\displaystyle x} is the solution to the equation f ( x ) = 0 {\\displaystyle f(x)=0} .[1] A \"zero\" of a function is thus an input value that produces an output of 0.[2]","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Zero_of_a_function"}
