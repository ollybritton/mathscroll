{"title":"Square-free polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, a square-free polynomial is a polynomial defined over a field (or more generally, an integral domain) that does not have as a divisor any square of a non-constant polynomial.[1] A univariate polynomial is square free if and only if it has no multiple root in an algebraically closed field containing its coefficients. This motivates that, in applications in physics and engineering, a square-free polynomial is commonly called a polynomial with no repeated roots.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Square-free_polynomial"}
