{"title":"Order-6 cubic honeycomb","summary":"The order-6 cubic honeycomb is a paracompact regular space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in hyperbolic 3-space. It is paracompact because it has vertex figures composed of an infinite number of facets, with all vertices as ideal points at infinity. With Schl√§fli symbol {4,3,6}, the honeycomb has six ideal cubes meeting along each edge. Its vertex figure is an infinite triangular tiling. Its dual is the order-4 hexagonal tiling honeycomb.","image":"H3_436_CC_center.png.webp","url":"Order-6_cubic_honeycomb"}
