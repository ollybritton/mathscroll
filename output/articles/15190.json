{"title":"Subfactor","summary":"In the theory of von Neumann algebras, a subfactor of a factor M {\\displaystyle M} is a subalgebra that is a factor and contains 1 {\\displaystyle 1} . The theory of subfactors led to the discovery of the Jones polynomial in knot theory.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Subfactor"}
