{"title":"Hyperbolic law of cosines","summary":"In hyperbolic geometry, the \"law of cosines\" is a pair of theorems relating the sides and angles of triangles on a hyperbolic plane, analogous to the planar law of cosines from plane trigonometry, or the spherical law of cosines in spherical trigonometry.[1][2][3] It can also be related to the relativistic velocity addition formula.[4][5][6]","image":"270fc2886b356284a8d4eaa03b972361a9ed6584.svg","url":"Hyperbolic_law_of_cosines"}
