{"title":"Set TSP problem","summary":"In combinatorial optimization, the set TSP, also known as the generalized TSP, group TSP, One-of-a-Set TSP, Multiple Choice TSP or Covering Salesman Problem, is a generalization of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), whereby it is required to find a shortest tour in a graph which visits all specified subsets of the vertices of a graph. The subsets of vertices must be disjoint, since the case of overlapping subsets can be reduced to the case of disjoint ones.[1] The ordinary TSP is a special case of the set TSP when all subsets to be visited are singletons. Therefore, the set TSP is also NP-hard.","image":"Generalised_TSP_knife_changes.png.webp","url":"Set_TSP_problem"}
