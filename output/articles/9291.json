{"title":"Lifting theory","summary":"In mathematics, lifting theory was first introduced by John von Neumann in a pioneering paper from 1931, in which he answered a question raised by Alfr√©d Haar.[1] The theory was further developed by Dorothy Maharam (1958)[2] and by Alexandra Ionescu Tulcea and Cassius Ionescu Tulcea (1961).[3] Lifting theory was motivated to a large extent by its striking applications. Its development up to 1969 was described in a monograph of the Ionescu Tulceas.[4] Lifting theory continued to develop since then, yielding new results and applications.","image":"947072b0aebec32885a49c51e2b0eeae8aa12330.svg","url":"Lifting_theory"}
