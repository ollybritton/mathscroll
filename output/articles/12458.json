{"title":"Pregeometry (model theory)","summary":"Pregeometry, and in full combinatorial pregeometry, are essentially synonyms for \"matroid\". They were introduced by Gian-Carlo Rota with the intention of providing a less \"ineffably cacophonous\" alternative term.  Also, the term combinatorial geometry, sometimes abbreviated to geometry, was intended to replace \"simple matroid\".  These terms are now infrequently used in the study of matroids.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Pregeometry_(model_theory)"}
