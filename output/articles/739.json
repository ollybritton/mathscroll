{"title":"Analytic Fredholm theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the analytic Fredholm theorem is a result concerning the existence of bounded inverses for a family of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. It is the basis of two classical and important theorems, the Fredholm alternative and the Hilbertâ€“Schmidt theorem. The result is named after the Swedish mathematician Erik Ivar Fredholm.","image":"b6efe7ba2a423c6b1666c37b12683061dba5054e.svg","url":"Analytic_Fredholm_theorem"}
