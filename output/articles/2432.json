{"title":"Central series","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the fields of group theory and Lie theory, a central series is a kind of normal series of subgroups or Lie subalgebras, expressing the idea that the commutator is nearly trivial. For groups, the existence of a central series means it is a nilpotent group; for matrix rings (considered as Lie algebras), it means that in some basis the ring consists entirely of upper triangular matrices with constant diagonal.","image":"8f5d3dc9366bebadeca9b49fe00e0cb5a9747095.svg","url":"Central_series"}
