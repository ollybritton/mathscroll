{"title":"Circular motion","summary":"In physics, circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed, or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts. The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body. In circular motion, the distance between the body and a fixed point on the surface remains the same.","image":"2c1d0f61f5c9b10e9cf7a208263f87f268ab92a1.svg","url":"Circular_motion"}
