{"title":"Constrained generalized inverse","summary":"In linear algebra, a constrained generalized inverse is obtained by solving a system of linear equations with an additional constraint that the solution is in a given subspace. One also says that the problem is described by a system of constrained linear equations.","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Constrained_generalized_inverse"}
