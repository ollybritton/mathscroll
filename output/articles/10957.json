{"title":"Natural neighbor interpolation","summary":"Natural neighbor interpolation is a method of spatial interpolation, developed by Robin Sibson.[1] The method is based on Voronoi tessellation of a discrete set of spatial points. This has advantages over simpler methods of interpolation, such as nearest-neighbor interpolation, in that it provides a smoother approximation to the underlying \"true\" function.","image":"Natural-neighbors-coefficients-example.png.webp","url":"Natural_neighbor_interpolation"}
