{"title":"Prosolvable group","summary":"In mathematics, more precisely in algebra, a prosolvable group (less common: prosoluble group) is a group that is isomorphic to the inverse limit of an inverse system of solvable groups. Equivalently, a group is called prosolvable, if, viewed as a topological group, every open neighborhood of the identity contains a normal subgroup whose corresponding quotient group is a solvable group.","image":"a27e5bccfdab3215dd1c6683a37b2604d6a267d7.svg","url":"Prosolvable_group"}
