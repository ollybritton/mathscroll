{"title":"Šidák correction for t-test","summary":"One of the application of Student's t-test is to test the location of one sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. If we want to test the locations of multiple sequences of such variables, Šidák correction should be applied in order to calibrate the level of the Student's t-test. Moreover, if we want to test the locations of nearly infinitely many sequences of variables, then Šidák correction should be used, but with caution. More specifically, the validity of Šidák correction depends on how fast the number of sequences goes to infinity.","image":"228d0b62225d037680fe232469e0e59f92a27c0f.svg","url":"Šidák_correction_for_t-test"}
