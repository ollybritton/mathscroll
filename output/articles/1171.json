{"title":"Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average","summary":"In statistics, autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average models are time series models that generalize ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) models by allowing non-integer values of the differencing parameter. These models are useful in modeling time series with long memoryâ€”that is, in which deviations from the long-run mean decay more slowly than an exponential decay. The acronyms \"ARFIMA\" or \"FARIMA\" are often used, although it is also conventional to simply extend the \"ARIMA(p, d, q)\" notation for models, by simply allowing the order of differencing, d, to take fractional values.","image":"b24bc3ecb30ce742bba56ce216a9922f9a3cb8a0.svg","url":"Autoregressive_fractionally_integrated_moving_average"}
