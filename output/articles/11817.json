{"title":"Parity graph","summary":"In graph theory, a parity graph is a graph in which every two induced paths between the same two vertices have the same parity: either both paths have odd length, or both have even length.[1] This class of graphs was named and first studied by Burlet & Uhry (1984).[2]","image":"Cubic_matchstick_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Parity_graph"}
