{"title":"Nonparametric regression","summary":"Nonparametric regression is a category of regression analysis in which the predictor does not take a predetermined form but is constructed according to information derived from the data. That is, no parametric form is assumed for the relationship between predictors and dependent variable. Nonparametric regression requires larger sample sizes than regression based on parametric models because the data must supply the model structure as well as the model estimates.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Nonparametric_regression"}
