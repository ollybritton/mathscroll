{"title":"Hiptmair–Xu preconditioner","summary":"In mathematics, Hiptmair–Xu (HX) preconditioners[1] are preconditioners for solving H ( curl ) {\\displaystyle H(\\operatorname {curl} )} and H ( div ) {\\displaystyle H(\\operatorname {div} )} problems based on the auxiliary space preconditioning framework.[2]  An important ingredient in the derivation of HX preconditioners in two and three dimensions is the so-called regular decomposition, which decomposes a Sobolev space function into a component of higher regularity and a scalar or vector potential. The key to the success of HX preconditioners is the discrete version of this decomposition, which is also known as HX decomposition.  The discrete decomposition decomposes a discrete Sobolev space function into a discrete component of higher regularity, a discrete scale or vector potential, and a high-frequency component.","image":"a9334e4faff3dd2251ff0634a0688f78d1fad506.svg","url":"Hiptmair–Xu_preconditioner"}
