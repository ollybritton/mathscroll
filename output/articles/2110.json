{"title":"CEP subgroup","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a subgroup of a group is said to have the Congruence Extension Property or to be a CEP subgroup if every congruence on the subgroup lifts to a congruence of the whole group. Equivalently, every normal subgroup of the subgroup arises as the intersection with the subgroup of a normal subgroup of the whole group.","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"CEP_subgroup"}
