{"title":"Icosahedral prism","summary":"In geometry, an icosahedral prism is a convex uniform 4-polytope (four-dimensional polytope). This 4-polytope has 22 polyhedral cells: 2 icosahedra connected by 20 triangular prisms. It has 70 faces: 30 squares and 40 triangles. It has 72 edges and 24 vertices.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Icosahedral_prism"}
