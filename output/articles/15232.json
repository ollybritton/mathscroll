{"title":"Sum-free set","summary":"In additive combinatorics and number theory, a subset A of an abelian group G is said to be sum-free if the sumset A + A is disjoint from A. In other words, A is sum-free if the equation a + b = c {\\displaystyle a+b=c} has no solution with a , b , c âˆˆ A {\\displaystyle a,b,c\\in A} .","image":"1c85465b60dd983e3d20d07b64938bbf40b9220d.svg","url":"Sum-free_set"}
