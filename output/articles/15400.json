{"title":"Symplectic geometry","summary":"Symplectic geometry is a branch of differential geometry and differential topology that studies symplectic manifolds; that is, differentiable manifolds equipped with a closed, nondegenerate 2-form. Symplectic geometry has its origins in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics where the phase space of certain classical systems takes on the structure of a symplectic manifold.[1]","image":"Limitcycle.svg.png.webp","url":"Symplectic_geometry"}
