{"title":"Malfatti circles","summary":"In geometry, the Malfatti circles are three circles inside a given triangle such that each circle is tangent to the other two and to two sides of the triangle. They are named after Gian Francesco Malfatti, who made early studies of the problem of constructing these circles in the mistaken belief that they would have the largest possible total area of any three disjoint circles within the triangle.","image":"Malfatti's_circles.svg.png.webp","url":"Malfatti_circles"}
