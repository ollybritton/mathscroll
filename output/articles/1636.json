{"title":"Binary entropy function","summary":"In information theory, the binary entropy function, denoted H ⁡ ( p ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {H} (p)} or H b ⁡ ( p ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {H} _{\\text{b}}(p)} , is defined as the entropy of a Bernoulli process with probability p {\\displaystyle p} of one of two values. It is a special case of H ( X ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {H} (X)} , the entropy function. Mathematically, the Bernoulli trial is modelled as a random variable X {\\displaystyle X} that can take on only two values: 0 and 1, which are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.","image":"6cd7224532c39923af99580572717dfcd65eb313.svg","url":"Binary_entropy_function"}
