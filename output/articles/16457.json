{"title":"Upper and lower bounds","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in order theory, an upper bound or majorant[1] of a subset S of some preordered set (K, â‰¤) is an element of K that is greater than or equal to every element of S.[2][3] Dually, a lower bound or minorant of S is defined to be an element of K that is less than or equal to every element of S. A set with an upper (respectively, lower) bound is said to be bounded from above or majorized[1] (respectively bounded from below or minorized) by that bound. The terms bounded above (bounded below) are also used in the mathematical literature for sets that have upper (respectively lower) bounds.[4]","image":"Illustration_of_supremum.svg.png.webp","url":"Upper_and_lower_bounds"}
