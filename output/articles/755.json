{"title":"Analytical hierarchy","summary":"In mathematical logic and descriptive set theory, the analytical hierarchy is an extension of the arithmetical hierarchy. The analytical hierarchy of formulas includes formulas in the language of second-order arithmetic, which can have quantifiers over both the set of natural numbers, N {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {N} } , and over functions from N {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {N} } to N {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {N} } . The analytical hierarchy of sets classifies sets by the formulas that can be used to define them; it is the lightface version of the projective hierarchy.","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"Analytical_hierarchy"}
