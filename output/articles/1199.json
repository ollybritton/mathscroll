{"title":"Axiom of limitation of size","summary":"In set theory, the axiom of limitation of size was proposed by John von Neumann in his 1925 axiom system for sets and classes.[1] It formalizes the limitation of size principle, which avoids the paradoxes encountered in earlier formulations of set theory by recognizing that some classes are too big to be sets. Von Neumann realized that the paradoxes are caused by permitting these big classes to be members of a class.[2] A class that is a member of a class is a set; a class that is not a set is a proper class. Every class is a subclass of V, the class of all sets.[lower-alpha 1] The axiom of limitation of size says that a class is a set if and only if it is smaller than Vâ€”that is, there is no function mapping it onto V. Usually, this axiom is stated in the equivalent form: A class is a proper class if and only if there is a function that maps it onto V.","image":"JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif","url":"Axiom_of_limitation_of_size"}
