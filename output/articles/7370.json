{"title":"Homomorphic encryption","summary":"Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without first having to decrypt it. The resulting computations are left in an encrypted form which, when decrypted, result in an output that is identical to that produced had the operations been performed on the unencrypted data.  Homomorphic encryption can be used for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation. This allows data to be encrypted and out-sourced to commercial cloud environments for processing, all while encrypted.","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Homomorphic_encryption"}
