{"title":"Vector optimization","summary":"Vector optimization is a subarea of mathematical optimization where optimization problems with a vector-valued objective functions are optimized with respect to a given partial ordering and subject to certain constraints.  A multi-objective optimization problem is a special case of a vector optimization problem: The objective space is the finite dimensional Euclidean space partially ordered by the component-wise \"less than or equal to\" ordering.","image":"84517c33c738aa1eb477e21e66845d42ef65c636.svg","url":"Vector_optimization"}
