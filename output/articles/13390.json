{"title":"Replica cluster move","summary":"Replica cluster move in condensed matter physics refers to a family of non-local cluster algorithms used to simulate spin glasses.[1][2][3] It is an extension of the Swendsen-Wang algorithm in that it generates non-trivial spin clusters informed by the interaction states on two (or more) replicas instead of just one. It is different from the replica exchange method (or parallel tempering), as it performs a non-local update on a fraction of the sites between the two replicas at the same temperature, while parallel tempering directly exchanges all the spins between two replicas at different temperature. However, the two are often used in conjunction to achieve state-of-the-art efficiency in simulating spin-glass models.[1]","image":"a6d08929846a50de5daf69f5b2615466b21b9db2.svg","url":"Replica_cluster_move"}
