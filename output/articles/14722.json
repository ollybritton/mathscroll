{"title":"Special classes of semigroups","summary":"In mathematics, a semigroup is a nonempty set together with an associative binary operation. A special class of semigroups  is a class of semigroups satisfying additional properties or conditions. Thus the class of commutative semigroups consists of all those semigroups in which the binary operation satisfies the commutativity property that ab = ba for all elements a and b in the semigroup. The class of finite semigroups consists of those semigroups for which the underlying set has finite cardinality. Members of the class of Brandt semigroups are required to satisfy not just one condition but a set of additional properties. A large collection of special classes of semigroups have been defined though not all of them have been studied equally intensively.","image":"716ebd8354bf9b5663769b6101c9d0a5515b9b9e.svg","url":"Special_classes_of_semigroups"}
