{"title":"Finite volume method","summary":"The finite volume method (FVM) is a method for representing and evaluating partial differential equations in the form of algebraic equations.[1] In the finite volume method, volume integrals in a partial differential equation that contain a divergence term are converted to surface integrals, using the divergence theorem. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each finite volume. Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods are conservative. Another advantage of the finite volume method is that it is easily formulated to allow for unstructured meshes. The method is used in many computational fluid dynamics packages. \"Finite volume\" refers to the small volume surrounding each node point on a mesh.[2]","image":"5057d5a558dfef7cb7770bb9006b7b24a6d630f3.svg","url":"Finite_volume_method"}
