{"title":"M22 graph","summary":"The M22 graph, also called the Mesner graph[1][2][3] or Witt graph[4] is the unique strongly regular graph with parameters (77, 16, 0, 4).[5] It is constructed from the Steiner system (3, 6, 22) by representing its 77 blocks as vertices and joining two vertices iff they have no terms in common or by deleting a vertex and its neighbors from the Higmanâ€“Sims graph.[6][7]","image":"M22_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"M22_graph"}
