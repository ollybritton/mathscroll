{"title":"Gilbreath shuffle","summary":"A Gilbreath shuffle is a way to shuffle a deck of cards, named after mathematician Norman Gilbreath (also known for Gilbreath's conjecture). Gilbreath's principle describes the properties of a deck that are preserved by this type of shuffle, and a Gilbreath permutation is a permutation that can be formed by a Gilbreath shuffle.[1]","image":"8226f30650ee4fe4e640c6d2798127e80e9c160d.svg","url":"Gilbreath_shuffle"}
