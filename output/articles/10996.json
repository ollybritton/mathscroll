{"title":"Neighbourhood components analysis","summary":"Neighbourhood components analysis is a supervised learning method for classifying multivariate data into distinct classes according to a given distance metric over the data. Functionally, it serves the same purposes as the K-nearest neighbors algorithm, and makes direct use of a related concept termed stochastic nearest neighbours.","image":"Kernel_Machine.svg.png.webp","url":"Neighbourhood_components_analysis"}
