{"title":"Moderation (statistics)","summary":"In statistics and regression analysis, moderation (also known as effect modification) occurs when the relationship between two variables depends on a third variable.  The third variable is referred to as the moderator variable (or effect modifier) or simply the moderator (or modifier).[1][2] The effect of a moderating variable is characterized statistically as an interaction;[1] that is, a categorical (e.g., sex, ethnicity, class) or continuous (e.g., age, level of reward) variable that is associated with the direction and/or magnitude of the relation between dependent and independent variables.  Specifically within a correlational analysis framework, a moderator is a third variable that affects the zero-order correlation between two other variables, or the value of the slope of the dependent variable on the independent variable. In analysis of variance (ANOVA) terms, a basic moderator effect can be represented as an interaction between a focal independent variable and a factor that specifies the appropriate conditions for its operation.[3]","image":"Simple_moderation_model_conceptual_diagram.jpg.webp","url":"Moderation_(statistics)"}
