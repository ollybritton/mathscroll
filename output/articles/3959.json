{"title":"Dense set","summary":"In topology and related areas of mathematics, a subset A of a topological space X is said to be dense in X if every point of X either belongs to A or else is arbitrarily \"close\" to a member of A â€” for instance, the rational numbers are a dense subset of the real numbers because every real number either is a rational number or has a rational number arbitrarily close to it (see Diophantine approximation). Formally, A {\\displaystyle A} is dense in X {\\displaystyle X} if the smallest closed subset of X {\\displaystyle X} containing A {\\displaystyle A} is X {\\displaystyle X} itself.[1]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Dense_set"}
