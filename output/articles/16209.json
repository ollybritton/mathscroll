{"title":"Tube domain","summary":"In mathematics, a tube domain is a generalization of the notion of a vertical strip (or half-plane) in the complex plane to several complex variables.  A strip can be thought of as the collection of complex numbers whose real part lie in a given subset of the real line and whose imaginary part is unconstrained; likewise, a tube is the set of complex vectors whose real part is in some given collection of real vectors, and whose imaginary part is unconstrained.","image":"a72968ba3ce528d3c19df831bc1727c94cea5fc7.svg","url":"Tube_domain"}
