{"title":"Incompressibility method","summary":"In mathematics, the incompressibility method is a proof method like the probabilistic method, the counting method or the pigeonhole principle. To prove that an object in a certain class (on average) satisfies a certain property, select an object of that class that is incompressible. If it does not satisfy the property, it can be compressed by computable coding. Since it can be generally proven that almost all objects in a given class are incompressible, the argument demonstrates that almost all objects in the class have the property involved (not just the average). To select an incompressible object is ineffective, and cannot be done by a computer program. However, a simple counting argument usually shows that almost all objects of a given class can be compressed by only a few bits (are incompressible).","image":"560dfdce0353a330e03e4b3e0b7ca6e484bb40fb.svg","url":"Incompressibility_method"}
