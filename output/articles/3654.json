{"title":"Curve-shortening flow","summary":"In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is a process that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed proportional to the curvature. The curve-shortening flow is an example of a geometric flow, and is the one-dimensional case of the mean curvature flow. Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, geometric heat flow,[1] and arc length evolution.","image":"Convex_curve_shortening.png.webp","url":"Curve-shortening_flow"}
