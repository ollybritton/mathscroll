{"title":"Projective module","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in algebra, the class of projective modules enlarges the class of free modules (that is, modules with basis vectors) over a ring, by keeping some of the main properties of free modules. Various equivalent characterizations of these modules appear below.","image":"Projective-module-P.svg.png.webp","url":"Projective_module"}
