{"title":"Mathematical fallacy","summary":"In mathematics, certain kinds of mistaken proof are often exhibited, and sometimes collected, as illustrations of a concept called mathematical fallacy. There is a distinction between a simple mistake and a mathematical fallacy in a proof, in that a mistake in a proof leads to an invalid proof while in the best-known examples of mathematical fallacies there is some element of concealment or deception in the presentation of the proof.","image":"e7ecc1379f32c4bd2d66842744bace91c4304852.svg","url":"Mathematical_fallacy"}
