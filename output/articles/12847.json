{"title":"Quantifier elimination","summary":"Quantifier elimination is a concept of simplification used in mathematical logic, model theory, and theoretical computer science. Informally, a quantified statement \" ∃ x {\\displaystyle \\exists x} such that … {\\displaystyle \\ldots } \" can be viewed as a question \"When is there an x {\\displaystyle x} such that … {\\displaystyle \\ldots } ?\", and the statement without quantifiers can be viewed as the answer to that question.[1]","image":"ab833914405cde960b3b9af3feaa9e4fef96ffa9.svg","url":"Quantifier_elimination"}
