{"title":"Ohsawa–Takegoshi L2 extension theorem","summary":"In several complex variables, the Ohsawa–Takegoshi L2 extension theorem is a fundamental result concerning the holomorphic extension of an L 2 {\\displaystyle L^{2}} -holomorphic function defined on a bounded Stein manifold (such as a pseudoconvex compact set in C n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{n}} of dimension less than n {\\displaystyle n} ) to a domain of higher dimension, with a bound on the growth. It was discovered by Takeo Ohsawa and Kensho Takegoshi in 1987,[1] using what have been described as ad hoc methods involving twisted Laplace–Beltrami operators, but simpler proofs have since been discovered.[2] Many generalizations and similar results exist, and are known as theorems of Ohsawa–Takegoshi type.","image":"ba162c66ca85776c83557af5088cc6f8584d1912.svg","url":"Ohsawa–Takegoshi_L2_extension_theorem"}
