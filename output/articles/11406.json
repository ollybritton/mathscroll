{"title":"One-form (differential geometry)","summary":"In differential geometry, a one-form on a differentiable manifold is a smooth section of the cotangent bundle.[1] Equivalently, a one-form on a manifold M {\\displaystyle M} is a smooth mapping of the total space of the tangent bundle of M {\\displaystyle M} to R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } whose restriction to each fibre is a linear functional on the tangent space.[2] Symbolically,","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"One-form_(differential_geometry)"}
