{"title":"Periodic travelling wave","summary":"In mathematics, a periodic travelling wave (or wavetrain) is a periodic function of one-dimensional space that moves with constant speed. Consequently, it is a special type of spatiotemporal oscillation that is a periodic function of both space and time.","image":"Travelling_wave_animated_plot.gif","url":"Periodic_travelling_wave"}
