{"title":"Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem","summary":"In geometry, the Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem,[1] named after William Wallace, Farkas Bolyai and P. Gerwien, is a theorem related to dissections of polygons. It answers the question when one polygon can be formed from another by cutting it into a finite number of pieces and recomposing these by translations and rotations. The Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem states that this can be done if and only if two polygons have the same area.","image":"Triangledissection.svg.png.webp","url":"Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien_theorem"}
