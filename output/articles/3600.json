{"title":"Cube root","summary":"In mathematics, a cube root of a number x is a number y such that y3 = x.  All nonzero real numbers, have exactly one real cube root and a pair of complex conjugate cube roots, and all nonzero complex numbers have three distinct complex cube roots.  For example, the real cube root of 8, denoted 8 3 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt[{3}]{8}}} , is 2, because 23 = 8, while the other cube roots of 8 are − 1 + i 3 {\\displaystyle -1+i{\\sqrt {3}}} and − 1 − i 3 {\\displaystyle -1-i{\\sqrt {3}}} . The three cube roots of −27i are","image":"513fcbe75ae8a28fbf5b6a762df26f92fa74ff1a.svg","url":"Cube_root"}
