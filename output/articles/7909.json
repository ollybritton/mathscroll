{"title":"Intermediate logic","summary":"In mathematical logic, a superintuitionistic logic is a propositional logic extending intuitionistic logic.  Classical logic is the strongest consistent superintuitionistic logic; thus, consistent superintuitionistic logics are called intermediate logics (the logics are intermediate between intuitionistic logic and classical logic).[1]","image":"72a9414528a2b4fc2d2d9b347c6785dea454f72c.svg","url":"Intermediate_logic"}
