{"title":"Fay's trisecant identity","summary":"In algebraic geometry, Fay's trisecant identity is an identity between theta functions of Riemann surfaces introduced by Fay (1973, chapter 3, page 34, formula 45). Fay's identity holds for theta functions of Jacobians of curves, but not for theta functions of general abelian varieties.","image":"2336b4bccb11ca2c94d7abec939242bedbd4da94.svg","url":"Fay's_trisecant_identity"}
