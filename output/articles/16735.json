{"title":"Wandering set","summary":"In dynamical systems and ergodic theory, the concept of a wandering set formalizes a certain idea of movement and mixing. When a dynamical system has a wandering set of non-zero measure, then the system is a dissipative system. This is the opposite of a conservative system, to which the Poincar√© recurrence theorem applies. Intuitively, the connection between wandering sets and dissipation is easily understood: if a portion of the phase space \"wanders away\" during normal time-evolution of the system, and is never visited again, then the system is dissipative.  The language of wandering sets can be used to give a precise, mathematical definition to the concept of a dissipative system.  The notion of wandering sets in phase space was introduced by Birkhoff in 1927.","image":"672b7e48a9c7c9f7b0be9a75555e0dbd87c64aaa.svg","url":"Wandering_set"}
