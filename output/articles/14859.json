{"title":"Square packing in a square","summary":"Square packing in a square is a packing problem where the objective is to determine how many squares of side one (unit squares) can be packed into a square of side a {\\displaystyle a} .  If a {\\displaystyle a} is an integer, the answer is a 2 {\\displaystyle a^{2}} , but the precise, or even asymptotic, amount of wasted space for non-integer a {\\displaystyle a} is an open question.[1]","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"Square_packing_in_a_square"}
