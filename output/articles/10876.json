{"title":"Möbius–Kantor graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Möbius–Kantor graph is a symmetric bipartite cubic graph with 16 vertices and 24 edges named after August Ferdinand Möbius and Seligmann Kantor. It can be defined as the generalized Petersen graph G(8,3): that is, it is formed by the vertices of an octagon, connected to the vertices of an eight-point star in which each point of the star is connected to the points three steps away from it.","image":"Möbius–Kantor_unit_distance.svg.png.webp","url":"Möbius–Kantor_graph"}
