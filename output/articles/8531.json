{"title":"k-regular sequence","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical computer science, a k-regular sequence is a sequence satisfying linear recurrence equations that reflect the base-k representations of the integers. The class of k-regular sequences generalizes the class of k-automatic sequences to alphabets of infinite size.","image":"b7ae485320273a06643451f95c6f2a0ba5847f3b.svg","url":"K-regular_sequence"}
