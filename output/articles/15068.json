{"title":"Stigler's law of eponymy","summary":"Stigler's law of eponymy, proposed by University of Chicago statistics professor Stephen Stigler in his 1980 publication Stigler’s law of eponymy,[1] states that no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer. Examples include Hubble's law, which was derived by Georges Lemaître two years before Edwin Hubble; the Pythagorean theorem, which was known to Babylonian mathematicians before Pythagoras; and Halley's Comet, which was observed by astronomers since at least 240 BC (although its official designation is due to the first ever mathematical prediction of such astronomical phenomenon in the sky, not to its discovery). Stigler himself named the sociologist Robert K. Merton as the discoverer of \"Stigler's law\" to show that it follows its own decree, though the phenomenon had previously been noted by others.[2]","image":"Johannes-kepler-tabulae-rudolphinae-google-arts-culture.jpg.webp","url":"Stigler's_law_of_eponymy"}
