{"title":"Quasi-abelian category","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in category theory, a quasi-abelian category is a pre-abelian category in which the pushout of a kernel along arbitrary morphisms is again a kernel and, dually, the pullback of a cokernel along arbitrary morphisms is again a cokernel.","image":"280ae03440942ab348c2ca9b8db6b56ffa9618f8.svg","url":"Quasi-abelian_category"}
