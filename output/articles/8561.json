{"title":"Kaiser window","summary":"The Kaiser window, also known as the Kaiserâ€“Bessel window, was developed by James Kaiser at Bell Laboratories. It is a one-parameter family of window functions used in finite impulse response filter design and spectral analysis.  The Kaiser window approximates the DPSS window which maximizes the energy concentration in the main lobe[1] but which is difficult to compute.[2]","image":"KaiserWindow.svg.png.webp","url":"Kaiser_window"}
