{"title":"Differential algebra","summary":"In mathematics, Differential algebra is, broadly speaking, the area of mathematics consisting in the study of differential equations and differential operators as algebraic objects in view of deriving properties of differential equations and operators without computing the solutions,  similarly as polynomial algebras are used for the study of algebraic varieties, which are solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. Weyl algebras and Lie algebras may be considered as belonging to differential algebra.","image":"486c60f4deff864cb20170ffda9a37b2364ae2d8.svg","url":"Differential_algebra"}
