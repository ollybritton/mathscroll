{"title":"Cyclotomic character","summary":"In number theory, a cyclotomic character is a character of a Galois group giving the Galois action on a group of roots of unity. As a one-dimensional representation over a ring R, its representation space is generally denoted by R(1) (that is, it is a representation χ : G → AutR(R(1)) ≈ GL(1, R)).","image":"e1c204b1ecf3770299b869304c749e5b3fc0999e.svg","url":"Cyclotomic_character"}
