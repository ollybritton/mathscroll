{"title":"Two-level grammar","summary":"A two-level grammar is a formal grammar that is used to generate another formal grammar,[1] such as one with an infinite rule set.[2] This is how a Van Wijngaarden grammar was used to specify Algol 68.[3] A context-free grammar that defines the rules for a second grammar can yield an effectively infinite set of rules for the derived grammar. This makes such two-level grammars more powerful than a single layer of context-free grammar, because generative two-level grammars have actually been shown to be Turing complete.[4]","image":"af219bba532d4cc4799a14af6ed6412d82758193.svg","url":"Two-level_grammar"}
