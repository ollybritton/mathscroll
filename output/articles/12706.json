{"title":"Pseudo-polynomial time","summary":"In computational complexity theory, a numeric algorithm runs in pseudo-polynomial time if its running time is a polynomial in the numeric value of the input (the largest integer present in the input)â€”but not necessarily in the length of the input (the number of bits required to represent it), which is the case for polynomial time algorithms.[1]","image":"7b607bcceee4eaa0e8b6e43066fdf39f3f8544f1.svg","url":"Pseudo-polynomial_time"}
