{"title":"Toric manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a toric manifold is a topological analogue of toric variety in algebraic geometry. It is an even-dimensional manifold with an effective smooth action of an n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional compact torus which is locally standard with the orbit space a simple convex polytope.[1][2]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Toric_manifold"}
