{"title":"Dedekind-infinite set","summary":"In mathematics, a set A is Dedekind-infinite (named after the German mathematician Richard Dedekind) if some proper subset B of A is equinumerous to A. Explicitly, this means that there exists a bijective function from A onto some proper subset B of A. A set is Dedekind-finite if it is not Dedekind-infinite (i.e., no such bijection exists). Proposed by Dedekind in 1888, Dedekind-infiniteness was the first definition of \"infinite\" that did not rely on the definition of the natural numbers.[1]","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"Dedekind-infinite_set"}
