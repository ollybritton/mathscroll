{"title":"Geodesics as Hamiltonian flows","summary":"In mathematics, the geodesic equations are second-order non-linear differential equations, and are commonly presented in the form of Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations of motion. However, they can also be presented as a set of coupled first-order equations, in the form of Hamilton's equations. This latter formulation is developed in this article.","image":"6717928e43348b8f727c826c20997130ca9011db.svg","url":"Geodesics_as_Hamiltonian_flows"}
