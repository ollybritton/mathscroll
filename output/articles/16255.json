{"title":"Twisted Poincaré duality","summary":"In mathematics, the twisted Poincaré duality is a theorem removing the restriction on Poincaré duality to oriented manifolds. The existence of a global orientation is replaced by carrying along local information, by means of a local coefficient system.","image":"418197b910aede8dafd3b430bc5389da389842bc.svg","url":"Twisted_Poincaré_duality"}
