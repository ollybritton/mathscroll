{"title":"Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in algebraic topology, the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms are properties that homology theories of topological spaces have in common. The quintessential example of a homology theory satisfying the axioms is singular homology, developed by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod.","image":"e63458b04288bbe116a9a8037dfae0b36b2c639a.svg","url":"Eilenberg–Steenrod_axioms"}
