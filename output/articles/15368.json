{"title":"Symmetric difference","summary":"In mathematics, the symmetric difference of two sets, also known as the disjunctive union, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. For example, the symmetric difference of the sets { 1 , 2 , 3 } {\\displaystyle \\{1,2,3\\}} and { 3 , 4 } {\\displaystyle \\{3,4\\}} is { 1 , 2 , 4 } {\\displaystyle \\{1,2,4\\}} .","image":"959905040c4110bae682eae9db986227c5506dcd.svg","url":"Symmetric_difference"}
