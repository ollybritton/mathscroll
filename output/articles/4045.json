{"title":"Diagonally dominant matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a square matrix is said to be diagonally dominant if, for every row of the matrix, the magnitude of the diagonal entry in a row is larger than or equal to the sum of the magnitudes of all the other (non-diagonal) entries in that row. More precisely, the matrix A is diagonally dominant if","image":"1c8fccf1156981af4b6d4ca6b26dbe2743ce8647.svg","url":"Diagonally_dominant_matrix"}
