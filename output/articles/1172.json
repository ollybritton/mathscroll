{"title":"Autoregressive integrated moving average","summary":"In statistics and econometrics, and in particular in time series analysis, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model.  To better comprehend the data or to forecast upcoming series points, both of these models are fitted to time series data. ARIMA models are applied in some cases where data show evidence of non-stationarity in the sense of mean (but not variance/autocovariance), where an initial differencing step (corresponding to the \"integrated\" part of the model) can be applied one or more times to eliminate the non-stationarity of the mean function (i.e., the trend).[1] When the seasonality shows in a time series, the seasonal-differencing[2] could be applied to eliminate the seasonal component. Since the ARMA model, according to the Wold's decomposition theorem,[3][4][5] is theoretically sufficient to describe a regular (a.k.a. purely nondeterministic[5]) wide-sense stationary time series, we are motivated to make stationary a non-stationary time series, e.g., by using differencing, before we can use the ARMA model.[6] Note that if the time series contains a predictable sub-process (a.k.a. pure sine or complex-valued exponential process[4]), the predictable component is treated as a non-zero-mean but periodic (i.e., seasonal) component in the ARIMA framework so that it is eliminated by the seasonal differencing.","image":"5db460c9aef01d9ac24615eddae93e270cfa7e84.svg","url":"Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average"}
