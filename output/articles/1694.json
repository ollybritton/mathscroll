{"title":"Bird (mathematical artwork)","summary":"Bird, also known as A Bird in Flight refers to bird-like mathematical artworks that are introduced by mathematical equations.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] A group of these figures are created by combing through tens of thousands of computer-generated images. They are usually defined by trigonometric functions.[8][9][10][11][12] An example of A Bird in Flight is made up of 500 segments defined in a Cartesian plane where for each k = 1 , 2 , 3 , â€¦ , 500 {\\displaystyle k=1,2,3,\\ldots ,500} the endpoints of the k {\\displaystyle k} -th line segment are:","image":"99343e306d86607a2817824bfaefb9c48638d605.svg","url":"Bird_(mathematical_artwork)"}
