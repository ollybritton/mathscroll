{"title":"Predicate variable","summary":"In mathematical logic, a predicate variable is a predicate letter which functions as a \"placeholder\" for a relation (between terms), but which has not been specifically assigned any particular relation (or meaning). Common symbols for denoting predicate variables include capital roman letters such as P {\\displaystyle P} , Q {\\displaystyle Q} and R {\\displaystyle R} , or lower case roman letters, e.g., x {\\displaystyle x} .[1] In first-order logic, they can be more properly called metalinguistic variables. In higher-order logic, predicate variables correspond to propositional variables which can stand for well-formed formulas of the same logic, and such variables can be quantified by means of (at least) second-order quantifiers.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Predicate_variable"}
