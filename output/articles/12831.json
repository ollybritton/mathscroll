{"title":"Quadrature domains","summary":"In the branch of mathematics called potential theory, a quadrature domain in two dimensional real Euclidean space  is a domain D (an open connected set) together with a finite subset {z1, …, zk} of D such that, for every function u harmonic and integrable over D with respect to area measure, the integral of u with respect to this measure is given by a \"quadrature formula\"; that is,","image":"615dd5dede9e58179500e84d1fbe67fee2514757.svg","url":"Quadrature_domains"}
