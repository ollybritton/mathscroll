{"title":"Difference set","summary":"In combinatorics, a ( v , k , λ ) {\\displaystyle (v,k,\\lambda )} difference set is a subset D {\\displaystyle D} of size k {\\displaystyle k} of a group G {\\displaystyle G} of order v {\\displaystyle v} such that every non-identity element of G {\\displaystyle G} can be expressed as a product d 1 d 2 − 1 {\\displaystyle d_{1}d_{2}^{-1}} of elements of D {\\displaystyle D} in exactly λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } ways. A difference set D {\\displaystyle D} is said to be cyclic, abelian, non-abelian, etc., if the group G {\\displaystyle G} has the corresponding property. A difference set with λ = 1 {\\displaystyle \\lambda =1} is sometimes called planar or simple.[1] If G {\\displaystyle G} is an abelian group written in additive notation, the defining condition is that every non-zero element of G {\\displaystyle G} can be written as a difference of elements of D {\\displaystyle D} in exactly λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } ways. The term \"difference set\" arises in this way.","image":"b6030e8915daa187087d3592ef6c6848fd73ec0a.svg","url":"Difference_set"}
