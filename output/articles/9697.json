{"title":"Loomis–Whitney inequality","summary":"In mathematics, the Loomis–Whitney inequality is a result in geometry, which in its simplest form, allows one to estimate the \"size\" of a d {\\displaystyle d} -dimensional set by the sizes of its ( d − 1 ) {\\displaystyle (d-1)} -dimensional projections. The inequality has applications in incidence geometry, the study of so-called \"lattice animals\", and other areas.","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Loomis–Whitney_inequality"}
