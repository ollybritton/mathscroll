{"title":"Delzant's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, a Delzant polytope is a convex polytope in R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} such for each vertex v {\\displaystyle v} , exactly n {\\displaystyle n} edges meet at v {\\displaystyle v} , and these edges form a collection of vectors that form a Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} } -basis of Z n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} ^{n}} . Delzant's theorem, introduced by Thomas DelzantÂ (1988), classifies effective Hamiltonian torus actions on compact connected symplectic manifolds by the image of the associated moment map, which is a Delzant polytope.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Delzant's_theorem"}
