{"title":"Irrational number","summary":"In mathematics, the irrational numbers (from in- prefix assimilated to ir- (negative prefix, privative) + rational) are all the real numbers that are not rational numbers. That is, irrational numbers cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. When the ratio of lengths of two line segments is an irrational number, the line segments are also described as being incommensurable, meaning that they share no \"measure\" in common, that is, there is no length (\"the measure\"), no matter how short, that could be used to express the lengths of both of the two given segments as integer multiples of itself.","image":"Square_root_of_2_triangle.svg.png.webp","url":"Irrational_number"}
