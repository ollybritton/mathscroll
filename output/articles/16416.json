{"title":"Unitary perfect number","summary":"A unitary perfect number is an integer which is the sum of its positive proper unitary divisors, not including the number itself (a divisor d of a number n is a unitary divisor if d and n/d share no common factors). Some perfect numbers are not unitary perfect numbers, and some unitary perfect numbers are not ordinary perfect numbers.","image":"77915bf8267b6eda2e62f79f12058daf4a1dd0d9.svg","url":"Unitary_perfect_number"}
