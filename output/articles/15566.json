{"title":"Tensor density","summary":"In differential geometry, a  tensor density or relative tensor is a generalization of the tensor field concept. A tensor density transforms as a tensor field when passing from one coordinate system to another (see tensor field), except that it is additionally multiplied or weighted by a power W of the Jacobian determinant of the coordinate transition function or its absolute value. A tensor density with a single index is called a vector density. A distinction is made among (authentic) tensor densities, pseudotensor densities, even tensor densities and odd tensor densities. Sometimes tensor densities with a negative weight W are called tensor capacity.[1][2][3] A tensor density can also be regarded as a section of the tensor product of a tensor bundle with a density bundle.","image":"a0ada43413fa26851fb1802ec8e87666f919be11.svg","url":"Tensor_density"}
