{"title":"Vectorization (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, especially in linear algebra and matrix theory, the vectorization of a matrix is a linear transformation which converts the matrix into a vector. Specifically, the vectorization of a m × n matrix A, denoted vec(A), is the mn × 1 column vector obtained by stacking the columns of the matrix A on top of one another:","image":"6f7fd753a3cb76711faed1d00d448a12e964143b.svg","url":"Vectorization_(mathematics)"}
