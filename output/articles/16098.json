{"title":"Triviality (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, the adjective trivial is often used to refer to a claim or a case which can be readily obtained from context, or an object which possesses a simple structure (e.g., groups, topological spaces).[1][2] The noun triviality usually refers to a simple technical aspect of some proof or definition. The origin of the term in mathematical language comes from the medieval trivium curriculum, which distinguishes from the more difficult quadrivium curriculum.[1][3] The opposite of trivial is nontrivial, which is commonly used to indicate that an example or a solution is not simple, or that a statement or a theorem is not easy to prove.[2]","image":"e6239f12a70a7f715303934acf9dbae208fceb80.svg","url":"Triviality_(mathematics)"}
