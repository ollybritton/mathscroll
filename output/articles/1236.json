{"title":"BK-space","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, a BK-space or Banach coordinate space is a sequence space endowed with a suitable norm to turn it into a Banach space. All BK-spaces are normable FK-spaces.[1]","image":"ae5e8f9eb465084d3a00a24026b80652b74ef58e.svg","url":"BK-space"}
