{"title":"Pfaffian","summary":"In mathematics, the determinant of a skew-symmetric matrix can always be written as the square of a polynomial in the matrix entries, a polynomial with integer coefficients that only depend on the size of the matrix. The value of this polynomial, when applied to the coefficients of a skew-symmetric matrix, is called the Pfaffian of that matrix. The term Pfaffian was introduced by Cayley (1852) who indirectly named them after Johann Friedrich Pfaff.  The Pfaffian (considered as a polynomial) is nonvanishing only for 2n × 2n skew-symmetric matrices, in which case it is a polynomial of degree n.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Pfaffian"}
