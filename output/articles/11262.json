{"title":"Nuclear C*-algebra","summary":"In the mathematical field of functional analysis, a nuclear C*-algebra is a C*-algebra A {\\displaystyle A} such that for every C*-algebra B {\\displaystyle B} the injective and projective C*-cross norms coincides on the algebraic tensor product A ⊗ B {\\displaystyle A\\otimes B} and the completion of A ⊗ B {\\displaystyle A\\otimes B} with respect to this norm is a C*-algebra. This property was first studied by Takesaki (1964) under the name \"Property T\", which is not related to Kazhdan's property T.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Nuclear_C*-algebra"}
