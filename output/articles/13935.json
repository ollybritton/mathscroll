{"title":"Schatten class operator","summary":"In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, a pth Schatten-class operator is a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space with finite pth Schatten norm.  The space of pth Schatten-class operators is a Banach space with respect to the Schatten norm.","image":"a1656cd0905af59acacca1e7ee4725cabd873019.svg","url":"Schatten_class_operator"}
