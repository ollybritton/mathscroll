{"title":"Mathematical exposure modeling","summary":"Mathematical exposure modeling is an indirect method of determining exposure, particularly for human exposure to environmental contaminants.  It is useful when direct measurement of pollutant concentration is not feasible because direct measurement sometimes requires skilled professionals and complex, expensive laboratory equipment.  The ability to make inferences in the absence of direct measurements, makes exposure modeling a powerful tool for predicting exposures by exploring hypothetical situations.  It allows researchers to ask \"what if\" questions about exposure scenarios.","image":"7e50b0c30e639a8f557e61cfec276cce4941b7a3.svg","url":"Mathematical_exposure_modeling"}
