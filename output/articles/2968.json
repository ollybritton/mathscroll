{"title":"Complemented subspace","summary":"In the branch of mathematics called functional analysis, a  complemented subspace of a topological vector space X , {\\displaystyle X,} is a vector subspace M {\\displaystyle M} for which there exists some other vector subspace N {\\displaystyle N} of X , {\\displaystyle X,} called its (topological) complement in X {\\displaystyle X} , such that X {\\displaystyle X} is the direct sum M âŠ• N {\\displaystyle M\\oplus N} in the category of topological vector spaces.   Formally, topological direct sums strengthen the algebraic direct sum by requiring certain maps be continuous; the result retains many nice properties from the operation of direct sum in finite-dimensional vector spaces.","image":"09ba32eeb405f7f5f2bac1eb12987c47d2fd42df.svg","url":"Complemented_subspace"}
