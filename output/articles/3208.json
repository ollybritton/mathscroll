{"title":"Congruum","summary":"In number theory, a congruum (plural congrua) is the difference between successive square numbers in an arithmetic progression of three squares. That is, if x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} , y 2 {\\displaystyle y^{2}} , and z 2 {\\displaystyle z^{2}} (for integers x {\\displaystyle x} , y {\\displaystyle y} , and z {\\displaystyle z} ) are three square numbers that are equally spaced apart from each other, then the spacing between them, z 2 − y 2 = y 2 − x 2 {\\displaystyle z^{2}-y^{2}=y^{2}-x^{2}} , is called a congruum.","image":"cf0bf28fd28f45d07e1ceb909ce333c18c558c93.svg","url":"Congruum"}
