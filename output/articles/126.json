{"title":"7-simplex honeycomb","summary":"In seven-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the 7-simplex honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). The tessellation fills space by 7-simplex, rectified 7-simplex, birectified 7-simplex, and trirectified 7-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 2:2:2:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"7-simplex_honeycomb"}
