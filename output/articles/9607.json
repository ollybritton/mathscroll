{"title":"Local hidden-variable theory","summary":"In the interpretation of quantum mechanics, a local hidden-variable theory is a hidden-variable theory that satisfies the condition of being consistent with local realism. This definition restricts all types of those theories that attempt to account for the probabilistic features of quantum mechanics via the mechanism of underlying inaccessible variables with the additional requirement that distant events be independent, ruling out instantaneous (that is, faster-than-light) interactions between separate events.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg","url":"Local_hidden-variable_theory"}
