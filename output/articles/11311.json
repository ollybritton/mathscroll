{"title":"O-minimal theory","summary":"In mathematical logic, and more specifically in model theory, an infinite structure (M,<,...) that is totally ordered by < is called an o-minimal structure if and only if every definable subset X ⊆ M (with parameters taken from M) is a finite union of intervals and points.","image":"1f6969c1a774dd829bcaefa14bede187d9242227.svg","url":"O-minimal_theory"}
