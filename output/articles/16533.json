{"title":"Vector algebra relations","summary":"The following are important identities in vector algebra. Identities that involve the magnitude of a vector ‖ A ‖ {\\displaystyle \\|\\mathbf {A} \\|} , or the dot product (scalar product) of two vectors A·B, apply to vectors in any dimension. Identities that use the cross product (vector product) A×B are defined only in three dimensions.[nb 1][1]","image":"01cc44bce17ad7f0dbc516545fe68bf4599bc4d8.svg","url":"Vector_algebra_relations"}
