{"title":"Compact closed category","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, compact closed categories are a general context for treating dual objects.  The idea of a dual object generalizes the more familiar concept of the dual of a finite-dimensional vector space.  So, the motivating example of a compact closed category is FdVect, the category having finite-dimensional vector spaces as objects and linear maps as morphisms, with tensor product as the monoidal structure. Another example is Rel, the category having sets as objects  and relations as morphisms, with Cartesian monoidal structure.","image":"12d3e8ef7179f9a1493fe6159740d09500af37ae.svg","url":"Compact_closed_category"}
