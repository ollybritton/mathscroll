{"title":"Differentiation of trigonometric functions","summary":"The differentiation of trigonometric functions is the mathematical process of finding the derivative of a trigonometric function, or its rate of change with respect to a variable. For example, the derivative of the sine function is written sinâ€²(a) = cos(a), meaning that the rate of change of sin(x) at a particular angle x = a is given by the cosine of that angle.","image":"Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_1.svg.png.webp","url":"Differentiation_of_trigonometric_functions"}
