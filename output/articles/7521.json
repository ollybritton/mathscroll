{"title":"Hypergeometric distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the hypergeometric distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of k {\\displaystyle k} successes (random draws for which the object drawn has a specified feature) in n {\\displaystyle n} draws, without replacement, from a finite population of size N {\\displaystyle N} that contains exactly K {\\displaystyle K} objects with that feature, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure. In contrast, the binomial distribution describes the probability of k {\\displaystyle k} successes in n {\\displaystyle n} draws with replacement.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Hypergeometric_distribution"}
