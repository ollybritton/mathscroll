{"title":"Apodization","summary":"In signal processing, apodization (from Greek \"removing the foot\") is the modification of the shape of a mathematical function. The function may represent an electrical signal, an optical transmission, or a mechanical structure. In optics, it is primarily used to remove Airy disks caused by diffraction around an intensity peak, improving the focus.","image":"Diffraction_disc_calculated.png.webp","url":"Apodization"}
