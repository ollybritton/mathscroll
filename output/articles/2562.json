{"title":"Chessboard complex","summary":"A chessboard complex is a particular kind of abstract simplicial complex, which has various applications in topological graph theory and algebraic topology.[1][2] Informally, the (m, n)-chessboard complex contains all sets of positions on an m-by-n chessboard, where rooks can be placed without attacking each other. Equivalently, it is the matching complex of the (m, n)-complete bipartite graph, or the independence complex of the m-by-n rook's graph.","image":"74f7bcb3c552800a5b12aedde05ecfa02dbf2642.svg","url":"Chessboard_complex"}
