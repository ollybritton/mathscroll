{"title":"Dirac equation","summary":"In particle physics, the Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation derived by British physicist Paul Dirac in 1928.

It is consistent with both the principles of quantum mechanics and the theory of special relativity,[1] and was the first theory to account fully for special relativity in the context of quantum mechanics. It was validated by accounting for the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum in a completely rigorous way.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg","url":"Dirac_equation"}
