{"title":"Magic hypercube","summary":"In mathematics, a magic hypercube is the k-dimensional generalization of magic squares and magic cubes, that is, an n × n × n × ... × n array of integers such that the sums of the numbers on each pillar (along any axis) as well as on the main space diagonals are all the same.  The common sum is called the magic constant of the hypercube, and is sometimes denoted Mk(n). If a magic hypercube consists of the numbers 1, 2, ..., nk, then it has magic number","image":"7acd5d201013d51a726e37c4a1ada385b4a88f0f.svg","url":"Magic_hypercube"}
