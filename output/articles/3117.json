{"title":"Computational Diffie–Hellman assumption","summary":"The computational Diffie–Hellman (CDH) assumption is a computational hardness assumption about the Diffie–Hellman problem.[1] The CDH assumption involves the problem of computing the discrete logarithm in cyclic groups. The CDH problem illustrates the attack of an eavesdropper in the Diffie–Hellman key exchange[2] protocol to obtain the exchanged secret key.","image":"172ab8411f3c8d1da295646366f3f997d7727b6b.svg","url":"Computational_Diffie–Hellman_assumption"}
