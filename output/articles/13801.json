{"title":"Runge窶適utta method (SDE)","summary":"In mathematics of stochastic systems, the Runge窶適utta method is a technique for the approximate numerical solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is a generalisation of the Runge窶適utta method for ordinary differential equations to stochastic differential equations (SDEs).  Importantly, the method does not involve knowing derivatives of the coefficient functions in the SDEs.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Runge窶適utta_method_(SDE)"}
