{"title":"Shimura correspondence","summary":"In number theory, the Shimura correspondence is a correspondence between modular forms F of half integral weight k+1/2, and modular forms f of even weight 2k, discovered by Goro ShimuraÂ (1973). It has the property that the eigenvalue of a Hecke operator Tn2 on F is equal to the eigenvalue of Tn on f.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Shimura_correspondence"}
