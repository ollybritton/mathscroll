{"title":"Quotient module","summary":"In algebra, given a module and a submodule, one can construct their quotient module.[1][2]  This construction, described below, is very similar to that of a quotient vector space. It differs from analogous quotient constructions of rings and groups by the fact that in these cases, the subspace that is used for defining the quotient is not of the same nature as the ambient space (that is, a quotient ring is the quotient of a ring by an ideal, not a subring, and a quotient group is the quotient of a group by a normal subgroup, not by a general subgroup).","image":"d60a7ec044aafda7685b062b023b95b2e3f9e252.svg","url":"Quotient_module"}
