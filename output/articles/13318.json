{"title":"Regular local ring","summary":"In commutative algebra, a regular local ring is a Noetherian local ring having the property that the minimal number of generators of its maximal ideal is equal to its Krull dimension.[1] In symbols, let A be a Noetherian local ring with maximal ideal m, and suppose a1, ..., an is a minimal set of generators of m.  Then by Krull's principal ideal theorem n â‰¥ dim A, and A is defined to be regular if n = dim A.","image":"0617c163a03d1584ad15e192f2d488ffaaef7d0c.svg","url":"Regular_local_ring"}
