{"title":"Modulus of convergence","summary":"In real analysis, a branch of mathematics, a modulus of convergence is a function that tells how quickly a convergent sequence converges.  These moduli are often employed in the study of computable analysis and constructive mathematics.","image":"e87000dd6142b81d041896a30fe58f0c3acb2158.svg","url":"Modulus_of_convergence"}
