{"title":"Sylow theorems","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in the field of finite group theory, the Sylow theorems are a collection of theorems named after the Norwegian mathematician Peter Ludwig Sylow[1] that give detailed information about the number of subgroups of fixed order that a given finite group contains. The Sylow theorems form a fundamental part of finite group theory and have very important applications in the classification of finite simple groups.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Sylow_theorems"}
