{"title":"Sargan–Hansen test","summary":"The Sargan–Hansen test or Sargan's J {\\displaystyle J} test is a statistical test used for testing over-identifying restrictions in a statistical model. It was proposed by John Denis Sargan in 1958,[1] and several variants were derived by him in 1975.[2] Lars Peter Hansen re-worked through the derivations and showed that it can be extended to general non-linear GMM in a time series context.[3]","image":"359e4f407b49910e02c27c2f52e87a36cd74c053.svg","url":"Sargan–Hansen_test"}
