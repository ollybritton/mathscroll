{"title":"Primality certificate","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, a primality certificate or primality proof is a succinct, formal proof that a number is prime. Primality certificates allow the primality of a number to be rapidly checked without having to run an expensive or unreliable primality test. \"Succinct\" usually means that the proof should be at most polynomially larger than the number of digits in the number itself (for example, if the number has b bits, the proof might contain roughly b2 bits).","image":"cd51f75cbbe50de059773d6267d76acbca43bbf1.svg","url":"Primality_certificate"}
