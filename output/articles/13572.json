{"title":"Riesz transform","summary":"In the mathematical theory of harmonic analysis, the Riesz transforms are a family of generalizations of the Hilbert transform to Euclidean spaces of dimension d > 1.  They are a type of singular integral operator, meaning that they are given by a convolution of one function with another function having a singularity at the origin.  Specifically, the Riesz transforms of a complex-valued function ƒ on Rd are defined by","image":"cae2cf96f35fd5f0901265ac81ee6046abaeaeb1.svg","url":"Riesz_transform"}
