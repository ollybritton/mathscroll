{"title":"Integration using parametric derivatives","summary":"In calculus, integration by parametric derivatives, also called parametric integration,[1] is a method which uses known Integrals to integrate derived functions. It is often used in Physics, and is similar to integration by substitution.","image":"718a95551cd3343395f807821b42e35bc2a07798.svg","url":"Integration_using_parametric_derivatives"}
