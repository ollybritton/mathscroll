{"title":"Closed-form expression","summary":"In mathematics, a closed-form expression is a mathematical expression that uses a finite number of standard operations. It may contain constants, variables, certain well-known operations (e.g., + − × ÷), and functions (e.g., nth root, exponent, logarithm, trigonometric functions, and inverse hyperbolic functions), but usually no limit, or integral.","image":"24c2ce44ca552049d96088988f5d83f6763c059a.svg","url":"Closed-form_expression"}
