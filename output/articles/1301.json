{"title":"Banach space","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in functional analysis, a Banach space (pronounced [Ëˆbanax]) is a complete normed vector space. Thus, a Banach space is a vector space with a metric that allows the computation of vector length and distance between vectors and is complete in the sense that a Cauchy sequence of vectors always converges to a well-defined limit that is within the space.","image":"f77baf392860a57be29cf5e96ed3fa622715f449.svg","url":"Banach_space"}
