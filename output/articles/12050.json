{"title":"Perron number","summary":"In mathematics, a Perron number is an algebraic integer α which is real and exceeds 1, but such that its conjugate elements are all less than α in absolute value.  For example, the larger of the two roots of the irreducible polynomial x 2 − 3 x + 1 {\\displaystyle x^{2}-3x+1} is a Perron number.","image":"e08de52158182d7bfacec9bde126ff636d6190a4.svg","url":"Perron_number"}
