{"title":"Space partitioning","summary":"In geometry, space partitioning is the process of dividing a space (usually a Euclidean space) into two or more disjoint subsets  (see also partition of a set).  In other words, space partitioning divides a space into non-overlapping regions.  Any point in the space can then be identified to lie in exactly one of the regions.","image":"0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538.svg","url":"Space_partitioning"}
