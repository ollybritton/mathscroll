{"title":"Steric 5-cubes","summary":"In five-dimensional geometry, a steric 5-cube or (steric 5-demicube or sterihalf 5-cube) is a convex uniform 5-polytope. There are unique 4 steric forms of the 5-cube. Steric 5-cubes have half the vertices of stericated 5-cubes.","image":"5-cube_t0.svg.png.webp","url":"Steric_5-cubes"}
