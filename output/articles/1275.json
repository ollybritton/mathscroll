{"title":"Bakhshali manuscript","summary":"The Bakhshali manuscript is an ancient mathematical text written on birch bark that was found in 1881 in the village of   Bakhshali, Mardan (near Peshawar in present-day Pakistan, historical Gandhara). It is perhaps \"the oldest extant manuscript in Indian mathematics.\"[4] For some portions a carbon-date was proposed of AD 224–383 while for other portions a carbon-date as late as AD 885–993 in a recent study, but the dating has been criticised by specialists on methodological grounds (Plofker et al. 2017[1] and Houben 2018 §3[2]). The manuscript contains the earliest known Indian use of a zero symbol.[5][6] It is written in a form of literary Sanskrit influenced by contemporary dialects.","image":"Bakhshali_manuscript.jpg.webp","url":"Bakhshali_manuscript"}
