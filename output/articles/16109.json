{"title":"True-range multilateration","summary":"True-range multilateration (also termed range-range multilateration and spherical multilateration) is a method to determine the location of a movable vehicle or stationary point in space using multiple ranges (distances) between the vehicle/point and multiple spatially-separated known locations (often termed \"stations\"). [1][2] Energy waves may be involved in determining range, but are not required.","image":"2D_Trilat_Scenario_2019-0116.jpg.webp","url":"True-range_multilateration"}
