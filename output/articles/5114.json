{"title":"Evolute","summary":"In the differential geometry of curves, the evolute of a curve is the locus of all its centers of curvature. That is to say that when the center of curvature of each point on a curve is drawn, the resultant shape will be the evolute of that curve. The evolute of a circle is therefore a single point at its center.[1]  Equivalently, an evolute is the envelope of the normals to a curve.","image":"Evolute-parab-1-e.svg.png.webp","url":"Evolute"}
