{"title":"Edge dominating set","summary":"In graph theory, an edge dominating set for a graph G = (V, E) is a subset D ⊆ E such that every edge not in D is adjacent to at least one edge in D. An edge dominating set is also known as a line dominating set. Figures (a)–(d) are examples of edge dominating sets (thick red lines).","image":"Edge-dominating-set.svg.png.webp","url":"Edge_dominating_set"}
