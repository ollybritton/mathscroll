{"title":"Łukasiewicz logic","summary":"In mathematics and philosophy, Łukasiewicz logic (/ˌluːkəˈʃɛvɪtʃ/ LOO-kə-SHEV-itch, Polish: [wukaˈɕɛvitʂ]) is a non-classical, many-valued logic. It was originally defined in the early 20th century by Jan Łukasiewicz as a three-valued modal logic;[1] it was later generalized to n-valued (for all finite n) as well as infinitely-many-valued (ℵ0-valued) variants, both propositional and first order.[2] The ℵ0-valued version was published in 1930 by Łukasiewicz and Alfred Tarski; consequently it is sometimes called the Łukasiewicz–Tarski logic.[3] It belongs to the classes of t-norm fuzzy logics[4] and substructural logics.[5]","image":"53e574cc3aa5b4bf5f3f5906caf121a378eef08b.svg","url":"Łukasiewicz_logic"}
