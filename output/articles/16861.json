{"title":"Weyl metrics","summary":"In general relativity, the Weyl metrics (named after the German-American mathematician Hermann Weyl)[1] are a class of static and axisymmetric solutions to Einstein's field equation. Three members in the renowned Kerr–Newman family solutions, namely the Schwarzschild, nonextremal Reissner–Nordström and extremal Reissner–Nordström metrics, can be identified as Weyl-type metrics.","image":"df9403d1fec76d146fc7e6b25a766c9162d6361e.svg","url":"Weyl_metrics"}
