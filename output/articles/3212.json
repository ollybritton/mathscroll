{"title":"Conical coordinates","summary":"Conical coordinates, sometimes called sphero-conal or sphero-conical coordinates, are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system consisting of concentric spheres (described by their radius r) and by two families of perpendicular elliptic cones, aligned along the z- and x-axes, respectively. The intersection between one of the cones and the sphere forms a spherical conic.","image":"Conical_coordinates.png.webp","url":"Conical_coordinates"}
