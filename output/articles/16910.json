{"title":"Wiener–Hopf method","summary":"The Wiener–Hopf method is a mathematical technique widely used in applied mathematics. It was initially developed by Norbert Wiener and Eberhard Hopf as a method to solve systems of integral equations, but has found wider use in solving two-dimensional partial differential equations with mixed boundary conditions on the same boundary. In general, the method works by exploiting the complex-analytical properties of transformed functions.  Typically, the standard Fourier transform is used, but examples exist using other transforms, such as the Mellin transform.","image":"aed80a2011a3912b028ba32a52dfa57165455f24.svg","url":"Wiener–Hopf_method"}
