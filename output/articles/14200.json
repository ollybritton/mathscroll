{"title":"Series acceleration","summary":"In mathematics, series acceleration is one of a collection of sequence transformations for improving the rate of convergence of a series. Techniques for series acceleration are often applied in numerical analysis, where they are used to improve the speed of numerical integration. Series acceleration techniques may also be used, for example, to obtain a variety of identities on special functions. Thus, the Euler transform applied to the hypergeometric series gives some of the classic, well-known hypergeometric series identities.","image":"5dc9038a2aa0146d045081cdcfbe70ff1a98396e.svg","url":"Series_acceleration"}
