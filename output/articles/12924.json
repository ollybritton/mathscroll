{"title":"Quasi-unmixed ring","summary":"In algebra, specifically in the theory of commutative rings, a quasi-unmixed ring (also called a formally equidimensional ring in EGA[1]) is a Noetherian ring A {\\displaystyle A} such that for each prime ideal p, the completion of the localization Ap is equidimensional, i.e. for each minimal prime ideal q in the completion A p ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {A_{p}}}} , dim ⁡ A p ^ / q = dim ⁡ A p {\\displaystyle \\dim {\\widehat {A_{p}}}/q=\\dim A_{p}} = the Krull dimension of Ap.[2]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Quasi-unmixed_ring"}
