{"title":"Continuous uniform distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the continuous uniform distributions or rectangular distributions are a family of symmetric probability distributions. Such a distribution describes an experiment where there is an arbitrary outcome that lies between certain bounds.[1] The bounds are defined by the parameters, a {\\displaystyle a} and b , {\\displaystyle b,} which are the minimum and maximum values. The interval can either be closed (i.e. [ a , b ] {\\displaystyle [a,b]} ) or open (i.e. ( a , b ) {\\displaystyle (a,b)} ).[2] Therefore, the distribution is often abbreviated U ( a , b ) , {\\displaystyle U(a,b),} where U {\\displaystyle U} stands for uniform distribution.[1] The difference between the bounds defines the interval length; all intervals of the same length on the distribution's support are equally probable. It is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variable X {\\displaystyle X} under no constraint other than that it is contained in the distribution's support.[3]","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"Continuous_uniform_distribution"}
