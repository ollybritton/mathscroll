{"title":"Sequential linear-quadratic programming","summary":"Sequential linear-quadratic programming (SLQP) is an iterative method for nonlinear optimization problems where objective function and constraints are twice continuously differentiable. Similarly to sequential quadratic programming (SQP), SLQP proceeds by solving a sequence of optimization subproblems. The difference between the two approaches is that:","image":"f6c8a0b471e6a737d346908f01469e9751570422.svg","url":"Sequential_linear-quadratic_programming"}
