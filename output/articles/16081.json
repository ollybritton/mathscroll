{"title":"Trilinear coordinates","summary":"In geometry, the trilinear coordinates x : y : z of a point relative to a given triangle describe the relative directed distances from the three sidelines of the triangle.  Trilinear coordinates are an example of homogeneous coordinates.  The ratio x : y is the ratio of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides (extended if necessary) opposite vertices A and B respectively; the ratio y : z is the ratio of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sidelines opposite vertices B and C respectively; and likewise for z : x and vertices C and A.","image":"Trilinear_coordinates.svg.png.webp","url":"Trilinear_coordinates"}
