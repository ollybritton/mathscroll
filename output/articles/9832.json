{"title":"Macbeath region","summary":"In mathematics, a Macbeath region is an explicitly defined region in convex analysis on a bounded convex subset of d-dimensional Euclidean space R d {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{d}} . The idea was introduced by Alexander MacbeathÂ (1952)[1] and dubbed by G. Ewald, D. G. Larman and C. A. Rogers in 1970.[2] Macbeath regions have been used to solve certain complex problems in the study of the boundaries of convex bodies.[3] Recently they have been used in the study of convex approximations and other aspects of computational geometry.[4][5]","image":"a713426956296f1668fce772df3c60b9dde8a685.svg","url":"Macbeath_region"}
