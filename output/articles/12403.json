{"title":"Positive linear operator","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in functional analysis, a positive linear operator from an preordered vector space ( X , ≤ ) {\\displaystyle (X,\\leq )} into a preordered vector space ( Y , ≤ ) {\\displaystyle (Y,\\leq )} is a linear operator f {\\displaystyle f} on X {\\displaystyle X} into Y {\\displaystyle Y} such that for all positive elements x {\\displaystyle x} of X , {\\displaystyle X,} that is x ≥ 0 , {\\displaystyle x\\geq 0,} it holds that f ( x ) ≥ 0. {\\displaystyle f(x)\\geq 0.} In other words, a positive linear operator maps the positive cone of the domain into the positive cone of the codomain.","image":"05986ce35d21b64f59206cb040c9c1607dae82b8.svg","url":"Positive_linear_operator"}
