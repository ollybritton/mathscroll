{"title":"Section conjecture","summary":"In anabelian geometry, a branch of algebraic geometry, the section conjecture gives a conjectural description of the splittings of the group homomorphism π 1 ( X ) → Gal ⁡ ( k ) {\\displaystyle \\pi _{1}(X)\\to \\operatorname {Gal} (k)} , where X {\\displaystyle X} is a complete smooth curve of genus at least 2 over a field k {\\displaystyle k} that is finitely generated over Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } , in terms of decomposition groups of rational points of X {\\displaystyle X} . The conjecture was introduced by Alexander Grothendieck (1997) in a 1983 letter to Gerd Faltings.","image":"3c975a827c37dfe5c485f44cf54daed02d7c96dd.svg","url":"Section_conjecture"}
