{"title":"Distance","summary":"Distance is a numerical or occasionally qualitative measurement of how far apart objects or points are. In physics or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical length or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. \"two counties over\").  Since spatial cognition is a rich source of conceptual metaphors in human thought,[1] the term is also frequently used metaphorically to mean a measurement of the amount of difference between two similar objects (such as statistical distance between probability distributions or edit distance between strings of text) or a degree of separation (as exemplified by distance between people in a social network).  Most such notions of distance, both physical and metaphorical, are formalized in mathematics using the notion of a metric space.","image":"Distance_board_in_Vizag.jpg.webp","url":"Distance"}
