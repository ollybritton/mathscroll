{"title":"Product numerical range","summary":"Given a Hilbert space with a tensor product structure a product numerical range is defined as a numerical range with respect to the subset of product vectors. In some situations, especially in the context of quantum mechanics product numerical range is known as local numerical range","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Product_numerical_range"}
