{"title":"Elliptic unit","summary":"In mathematics, elliptic units are certain units of abelian extensions of imaginary quadratic fields constructed using singular values of modular functions, or division values of elliptic functions. They were introduced by Gilles Robert in 1973, and were used by John Coates and Andrew Wiles in their work on the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Elliptic units are an analogue for imaginary quadratic fields of cyclotomic units. They form an example of an Euler system.","image":"b21941c148ee3425fdba4410f706d50cc87a4dfa.svg","url":"Elliptic_unit"}
