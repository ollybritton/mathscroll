{"title":"Linear equation over a ring","summary":"In algebra, linear equations and systems of linear equations over a field are widely studied. \"Over a field\" means that the coefficients of the equations and the solutions that one is looking for belong to a given field, commonly the real or the complex numbers. This article is devoted to the same problems where \"field\" is replaced by \"commutative ring\", or, typically \"Noetherian integral domain\".","image":"abb9644f506450cc7385b9b4e710240f297a608c.svg","url":"Linear_equation_over_a_ring"}
