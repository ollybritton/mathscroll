{"title":"Central simple algebra","summary":"In ring theory and related areas of mathematics a central simple algebra (CSA) over a field K is a finite-dimensional associative K-algebra A which is simple, and for which the center is exactly K. (Note that not every simple algebra is a central simple algebra over its center: for instance, if K is a field of characteristic 0, then the Weyl algebra K [ X , âˆ‚ X ] {\\displaystyle K[X,\\partial _{X}]} is a simple algebra with center K, but is not a central simple algebra over K as it has infinite dimension as a K-module.)","image":"0ac67a6a2a1701b59391f32993f53fd1ff670b27.svg","url":"Central_simple_algebra"}
