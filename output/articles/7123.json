{"title":"Heronian tetrahedron","summary":"A Heronian tetrahedron[1] (also called a Heron tetrahedron[2] or perfect pyramid[3]) is a tetrahedron whose edge lengths, face areas and volume are all integers. The faces must therefore all be Heronian triangles. Every Heronian tetrahedron can be arranged in Euclidean space so that its vertex coordinates are also integers.[1]","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"Heronian_tetrahedron"}
