{"title":"Satellite knot","summary":"In the mathematical theory of knots, a satellite knot is a knot that contains an incompressible, non boundary-parallel torus in its complement.[1] Every knot is either hyperbolic, a torus, or a satellite knot. The class of satellite knots include composite knots, cable knots, and Whitehead doubles.  A satellite link is one that orbits a companion knot K in the sense that it lies inside a regular neighborhood of the companion.[2]:â€Š217","image":"Sum_of_knots3.svg.png.webp","url":"Satellite_knot"}
