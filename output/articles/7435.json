{"title":"Hrushovski construction","summary":"In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, the Hrushovski construction generalizes the Fraïssé limit by working with a notion of strong substructure ≤ {\\displaystyle \\leq } rather than ⊆ {\\displaystyle \\subseteq } . It can be thought of as a kind of \"model-theoretic forcing\", where a (usually) stable structure is created, called the generic or rich [1] model. The specifics of ≤ {\\displaystyle \\leq } determine various properties of the generic, with its geometric properties being of particular interest. It was initially used by Ehud Hrushovski to generate a stable structure with an \"exotic\" geometry, thereby refuting Zil'ber's Conjecture.","image":"440568a09c3bfdf0e1278bfa79eb137c04e94035.svg","url":"Hrushovski_construction"}
