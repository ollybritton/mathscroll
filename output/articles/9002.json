{"title":"Landweber iteration","summary":"The Landweber iteration or Landweber algorithm is an algorithm to solve ill-posed linear inverse problems, and it has been extended to solve non-linear problems that involve constraints. The method was first proposed in the 1950s by Louis Landweber,[1] and it can be now viewed as a special case of many other more general methods.[2]","image":"c732810c5d2f174cdbb0eadcf89727e92ce5fbb0.svg","url":"Landweber_iteration"}
