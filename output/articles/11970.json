{"title":"Pentagram","summary":"A pentagram (sometimes known as a pentalpha, pentangle, or star pentagon) is a regular five-pointed star polygon, formed from the diagonal line segments of a convex (or simple, or non-self-intersecting) regular pentagon. Drawing a circle around the five points creates a similar symbol referred to as the pentacle, which is used widely by Wiccans and in paganism, or as a sign of life and connections. The word \"pentagram\" refers only to the five-pointed star, not the surrounding circle of a pentacle.","image":"Five_Pointed_Star_Lined.svg.png.webp","url":"Pentagram"}
