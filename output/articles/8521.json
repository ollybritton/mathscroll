{"title":"K-convex function","summary":"K-convex functions, first introduced by Scarf,[1] are a special weakening of the concept of convex function which is crucial in the proof of the optimality of the ( s , S ) {\\displaystyle (s,S)} policy in inventory control theory. The policy is characterized by two numbers s and S, S â‰¥ s {\\displaystyle S\\geq s} , such that when the inventory level falls below level s, an order is issued for a quantity that brings the inventory up to level S, and nothing is ordered otherwise. Gallego and Sethi [2] have generalized the concept of K-convexity to higher dimensional Euclidean spaces.","image":"75b3f358a368c7f58e4353fd5e0ebd38e656e2d9.svg","url":"K-convex_function"}
