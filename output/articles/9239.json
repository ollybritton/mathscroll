{"title":"Levi decomposition","summary":"In Lie theory and representation theory, the Levi decomposition, conjectured by Wilhelm Killing[1] and Élie Cartan[2] and proved by Eugenio Elia Levi (1905), states that any finite-dimensional real{Change real Lie algebra to a Lie algebra over a field of characterisitic 0} Lie algebra g is  the semidirect product of  a solvable ideal and a semisimple subalgebra. One is its radical, a maximal solvable ideal, and the other is a semisimple subalgebra, called a Levi subalgebra. The Levi decomposition implies that any finite-dimensional Lie algebra is a semidirect product of a solvable Lie algebra and a semisimple Lie algebra.","image":"a5d6df258fb29046744f00f25332fc71dcc2013d.svg","url":"Levi_decomposition"}
