{"title":"Convexity (algebraic geometry)","summary":"In algebraic geometry, convexity is a restrictive technical condition for algebraic varieties originally introduced to analyze Kontsevich moduli spaces M ¯ 0 , n ( X , β ) {\\displaystyle {\\overline {M}}_{0,n}(X,\\beta )} in quantum cohomology.[1]: §1 [2][3] These moduli spaces are smooth orbifolds whenever the target space is convex. A variety X {\\displaystyle X} is called convex if the pullback of the tangent bundle to a stable rational curve f : C → X {\\displaystyle f:C\\to X} has globally generated sections.[2] Geometrically this implies the curve is free to move around X {\\displaystyle X} infinitesimally without any obstruction. Convexity is generally phrased as the technical condition","image":"44d9e4e1cb14683bf000a5643239b964cf548fd4.svg","url":"Convexity_(algebraic_geometry)"}
