{"title":"Duality (optimization)","summary":"In mathematical optimization theory, duality or the duality principle is the principle that optimization problems may be viewed from either of two perspectives, the primal problem or the dual problem. If the primal is a minimization problem then the dual is a maximization problem (and vice versa). Any feasible solution to the primal (minimization) problem is at least as large as any feasible solution to the dual (maximization) problem. Therefore, the solution to the primal is an upper bound to the solution of the dual, and the solution of the dual is a lower bound to the solution of the primal.[1] This fact is called weak duality.","image":"705702e3923dd25437b2d1935dec1079e06e3e2b.svg","url":"Duality_(optimization)"}
