{"title":"Askey–Wilson polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the Askey–Wilson polynomials (or q-Wilson polynomials) are a family of orthogonal polynomials introduced by Askey and  Wilson (1985) as q-analogs of the Wilson polynomials. They include many of the other orthogonal polynomials in 1 variable as special or limiting cases, described in the Askey scheme. Askey–Wilson polynomials are the special case of Macdonald polynomials (or Koornwinder polynomials) for the non-reduced affine root system of type (C∨1, C1), and their 4 parameters a, b, c, d correspond to the 4 orbits of roots of this root system.","image":"1d0fd99eb1abe68fe7e32885d60a8ba10f11db65.svg","url":"Askey–Wilson_polynomials"}
