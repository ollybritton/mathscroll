{"title":"Kőnig's lemma","summary":"Kőnig's lemma or Kőnig's infinity lemma is a theorem in graph theory due to the Hungarian mathematician Dénes Kőnig who published it in 1927.[1] It gives a sufficient condition for an infinite graph to have an infinitely long path. The computability aspects of this theorem have been thoroughly investigated by researchers in mathematical logic, especially in computability theory.  This theorem also has important roles in constructive mathematics and proof theory.","image":"Denes_König_-_Über_eine_Schlussweise_aus_dem_Endlichen_ins_Unendliche.png.webp","url":"Kőnig's_lemma"}
