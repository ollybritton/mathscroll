{"title":"Globular set","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a globular set is a higher-dimensional generalization of a directed graph. Precisely, it is a sequence of sets X 0 , X 1 , X 2 , … {\\displaystyle X_{0},X_{1},X_{2},\\dots } equipped with pairs of functions s n , t n : X n → X n − 1 {\\displaystyle s_{n},t_{n}:X_{n}\\to X_{n-1}} such that","image":"e068505f72a88bf2c295490331817273592e0788.svg","url":"Globular_set"}
