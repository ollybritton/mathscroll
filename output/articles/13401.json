{"title":"Representation theory of the Lorentz group","summary":"The Lorentz group is a Lie group of symmetries of the spacetime of special relativity.  This group can be realized as a collection of matrices, linear transformations, or unitary operators on some Hilbert space; it has a variety of representations.[nb 1]  This group is significant because special relativity together with quantum mechanics are the two physical theories that are most thoroughly established,[nb 2] and the conjunction of these two theories is the study of the infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the Lorentz group.  These have both historical importance in mainstream physics, as well as connections to more speculative present-day theories.","image":"Einstein_en_Lorentz.jpg.webp","url":"Representation_theory_of_the_Lorentz_group"}
