{"title":"Curry's paradox","summary":"Curry's paradox is a paradox in which an arbitrary claim F is proved from the mere existence of a sentence C that says of itself \"If C, then F\", requiring only a few apparently innocuous logical deduction rules. Since F is arbitrary, any logic having these rules allows one to prove everything. The paradox may be expressed in natural language and in various logics, including certain forms of set theory, lambda calculus, and combinatory logic.","image":"70092e1fb651b85773dc5c779031f8e779c42c9e.svg","url":"Curry's_paradox"}
