{"title":"K-theory of a category","summary":"In algebraic K-theory, the K-theory of a category C (usually equipped with some kind of additional data) is a sequence of abelian groups Ki(C) associated to it. If C is an abelian category, there is no need for extra data, but in general it only makes sense to speak of K-theory after specifying on C a structure of an exact category, or of a Waldhausen category, or of a dg-category, or possibly some other variants. Thus, there are several constructions of those groups, corresponding to various kinds of structures put on C. Traditionally, the K-theory of C is defined to be the result of a suitable construction, but in some contexts there are more conceptual definitions. For instance, the K-theory is a 'universal additive invariant' of dg-categories[1] and small stable âˆž-categories.[2]","image":"795d72de11bb1c7341e85c61e7aacef0872091e6.svg","url":"K-theory_of_a_category"}
