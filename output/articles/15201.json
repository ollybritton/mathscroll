{"title":"Subobject","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a subobject is, roughly speaking, an object that sits inside another object in the same category.  The notion is a generalization of concepts such as subsets from set theory, subgroups from group theory,[1] and subspaces from topology.  Since the detailed structure of objects is immaterial in category theory, the definition of subobject relies on a morphism that describes how one object sits inside another, rather than relying on the use of elements.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Subobject"}
