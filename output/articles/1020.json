{"title":"Arrangement of lines","summary":"In geometry, an arrangement of lines is the subdivision of the plane formed by a collection of lines. Bounds on the complexity of arrangements have been studied in discrete geometry, and computational geometers have found algorithms for the efficient construction of arrangements.","image":"Complete-quads.svg.png.webp","url":"Arrangement_of_lines"}
