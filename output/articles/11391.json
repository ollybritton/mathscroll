{"title":"Omnigeneity","summary":"Omnigeneity (sometimes also called omnigenity) is a property of a magnetic field inside a magnetic confinement fusion reactor. Such a magnetic field is called omnigenous if the path a single particle takes does not drift radially inwards or outwards on average.[1] A particle is then confined to stay on a flux surface. All tokamaks are exactly omnigenous by virtue of their axisymmetry,[2] and conversely an unoptimized stellarator is generally not omnigenous.","image":"W7X-Spulen_Plasma_blau_gelb.jpg.webp","url":"Omnigeneity"}
