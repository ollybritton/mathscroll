{"title":"Luus–Jaakola","summary":"In computational engineering, Luus–Jaakola (LJ) denotes a heuristic for global optimization of a real-valued function.[1] In engineering use, LJ is not an algorithm that terminates with an optimal solution; nor is it an iterative method that generates a sequence of points that converges to an optimal solution (when one exists). However, when applied to a twice continuously differentiable function, the LJ heuristic is a proper iterative method, that generates a sequence that has a convergent subsequence; for this class of problems, Newton's method is recommended and enjoys a quadratic rate of convergence, while no convergence rate analysis has been given for the LJ heuristic.[1] In practice, the LJ heuristic has been recommended for functions that need be neither convex nor differentiable nor locally Lipschitz: The LJ heuristic does not use a gradient or subgradient when one be available, which allows its application to non-differentiable and non-convex problems.","image":"Random_sampling_unimodal_function_(1).JPG.webp","url":"Luus–Jaakola"}
