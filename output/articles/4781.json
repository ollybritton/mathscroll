{"title":"Elongated pentagonal orthobirotunda","summary":"In geometry, the elongated pentagonal orthobirotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J42). Its Conway polyhedron notation is at5jP5. As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal orthobirotunda (J34) by inserting a decagonal prism between its congruent halves. Rotating one of the pentagonal rotundae (J6) through 36Â degrees before inserting the prism yields the elongated pentagonal gyrobirotunda (J43).","image":"Elongated_pentagonal_orthobirotunda.png.webp","url":"Elongated_pentagonal_orthobirotunda"}
