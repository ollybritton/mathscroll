{"title":"Radius of curvature","summary":"In differential geometry, the radius of curvature (Rc), R, is the reciprocal of the curvature. For a curve, it equals the radius of the circular arc which best approximates the curve at that point. For surfaces, the radius of curvature is the radius of a circle that best fits a normal section or combinations thereof.[1][2][3]","image":"Radius_of_curvature.svg.png.webp","url":"Radius_of_curvature"}
