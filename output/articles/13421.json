{"title":"Residue theorem","summary":"In complex analysis, the residue theorem, sometimes called Cauchy's residue theorem, is a powerful tool to evaluate line integrals of analytic functions over closed curves; it can often be used to compute real integrals and infinite series as well. It generalizes the Cauchy integral theorem and Cauchy's integral formula.  From a geometrical perspective, it can be seen as a special case of the generalized Stokes' theorem.","image":"Gamma_abs_3D.png.webp","url":"Residue_theorem"}
