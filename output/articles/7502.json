{"title":"Hyperbolic volume","summary":"In the mathematical field of knot theory, the hyperbolic volume of a hyperbolic link is the volume of the link's complement with respect to its complete hyperbolic metric.  The volume is necessarily a finite real number, and is a topological invariant of the link.[1] As a link invariant, it was first studied by William Thurston in connection with his geometrization conjecture.[2]","image":"Blue_Figure-Eight_Knot.png.webp","url":"Hyperbolic_volume"}
