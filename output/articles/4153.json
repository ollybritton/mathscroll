{"title":"Dini–Lipschitz criterion","summary":"In mathematics, the Dini–Lipschitz criterion is a sufficient condition for the Fourier series of a periodic function to converge uniformly at all real numbers. It was introduced by Ulisse Dini (1872), as a strengthening of a weaker criterion introduced by Rudolf Lipschitz (1864). The criterion states that the Fourier series of a periodic function f converges uniformly on the real line if","image":"1dae7335aa6da7a8eefbe645484bebd10d3a625e.svg","url":"Dini–Lipschitz_criterion"}
