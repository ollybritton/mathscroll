{"title":"Lemniscate constant","summary":"In mathematics, the lemniscate constant ϖ[1][2][3][4][5] is a transcendental mathematical constant that is the ratio of the perimeter of Bernoulli's lemniscate to its diameter, analogous to the definition of π for the circle. Equivalently, the perimeter of the lemniscate ( x 2 + y 2 ) 2 = x 2 − y 2 {\\displaystyle (x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}=x^{2}-y^{2}} is 2ϖ. The lemniscate constant is closely related to the lemniscate elliptic functions and approximately equal to 2.62205755.[6][7][8][9] The symbol ϖ is a cursive variant of π; see Pi § Variant pi.","image":"c10d4bfa7b558f088a810512bcf93854acbbe172.svg","url":"Lemniscate_constant"}
