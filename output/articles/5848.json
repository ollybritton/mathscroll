{"title":"Fundamental group scheme","summary":"In mathematics, the fundamental group scheme is a group scheme canonically attached to a scheme over a Dedekind scheme (e.g. the spectrum of a field or the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring). It is a generalisation of the Ã©tale fundamental group.  Although its existence was conjectured by Alexander Grothendieck, the first proof if its existence is due, for schemes defined over fields, to Madhav Nori.[1][2][3] A proof of its existence for schemes defined over Dedekind schemes is due to Marco Antei, Michel Emsalem and Carlo Gasbarri.[4][5]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Fundamental_group_scheme"}
