{"title":"Rhombille tiling","summary":"In geometry, the rhombille tiling,[1] also known as tumbling blocks,[2] reversible cubes, or the dice lattice, is a tessellation of identical 60° rhombi on the Euclidean plane. Each rhombus has two 60° and two 120° angles; rhombi with this shape are sometimes also called diamonds. Sets of three rhombi meet at their 120° angles, and sets of six rhombi meet at their 60° angles.","image":"1-uniform_7_dual.svg.png.webp","url":"Rhombille_tiling"}
