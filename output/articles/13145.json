{"title":"Rational normal curve","summary":"In mathematics, the rational normal curve is a smooth, rational curve C of degree n in projective n-space Pn. It is a simple example of a projective variety; formally, it is the Veronese variety when the domain is the projective line. For n = 2 it is the plane conic Z0Z2 = Z21, and for n = 3 it is the twisted cubic. The term \"normal\" refers to projective normality, not normal schemes. The intersection of the rational normal curve with an affine space is called the moment curve.","image":"d855526f25d3b8a8eb97e3e6345ea7827f6b021f.svg","url":"Rational_normal_curve"}
