{"title":"Matrix factorization of a polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, a matrix factorization of a polynomial is a technique for factoring irreducible polynomials with matrices. David Eisenbud proved that every multivariate real-valued polynomial p without linear terms can be written as a AB = pI, where A and B are square matrices and I is the identity matrix.[1]  Given the polynomial p, the matrices A and B can be found by elementary methods.[2]","image":"8c6602bba2981e7886239fc1eeebbc33006b361c.svg","url":"Matrix_factorization_of_a_polynomial"}
