{"title":"Dirichlet form","summary":"In potential theory (the study of harmonic function) and functional analysis, Dirichlet forms generalize the Laplacian (the mathematical operator on scalar fields). Dirichlet forms can be defined on any measure space, without the need for mentioning partial derivatives. This allows mathematicians to study the Laplace equation and heat equation on spaces that are not manifolds, for example, fractals. The benefit on these spaces is that one can do this without needing a gradient operator, and in particular, one can even weakly define a \"Laplacian\" in this manner if starting with the Dirichlet form.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Dirichlet_form"}
