{"title":"Complete Boolean algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a complete Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra in which every subset has a supremum (least upper bound).  Complete Boolean algebras are used to construct Boolean-valued models of set theory in the theory of forcing.  Every Boolean algebra A has an essentially unique completion, which is a complete Boolean algebra containing A such that every element is the supremum of some subset of A.  As a partially ordered set, this completion of A is the Dedekindâ€“MacNeille completion.","image":"74954195333a8593163b93a9688695b8dc74da55.svg","url":"Complete_Boolean_algebra"}
