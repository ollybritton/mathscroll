{"title":"Degenerate conic","summary":"In geometry, a degenerate conic is a conic (a second-degree plane curve, defined by a polynomial equation of degree two) that fails to be an irreducible curve. This means that the defining equation is factorable over the complex numbers (or more generally over an algebraically closed field) as the product of two linear polynomials.[note 1]","image":"Kegs-ausg-sg-s.svg.png.webp","url":"Degenerate_conic"}
