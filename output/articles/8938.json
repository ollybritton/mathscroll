{"title":"L (complexity)","summary":"In computational complexity theory, L (also known as LSPACE or DLOGSPACE) is the complexity class containing decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a logarithmic amount of writable memory space.[1][2] Formally, the Turing machine has two tapes, one of which encodes the input and can only be read, whereas the other tape has logarithmic size but can be read as well as written. Logarithmic space is sufficient to hold a constant number of pointers into the input[1] and a logarithmic number of boolean flags, and many basic logspace algorithms use the memory in this way.","image":"0145ec1d11424666da47c4a893d89db3809d839a.svg","url":"L_(complexity)"}
