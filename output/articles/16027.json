{"title":"Triangle group","summary":"In mathematics, a triangle group is a group that can be realized geometrically by sequences of reflections across the sides of a triangle.  The triangle can be an ordinary Euclidean triangle, a triangle on the sphere, or a hyperbolic triangle. Each triangle group is the symmetry group of a tiling of the Euclidean plane, the sphere, or the hyperbolic plane by congruent triangles called MÃ¶bius triangles, each one a fundamental domain for the action.","image":"40edd586c0cd7f26489867ff5d69c176745fd131.svg","url":"Triangle_group"}
