{"title":"Rigid analytic space","summary":"In mathematics, a rigid analytic space is an analogue of a complex analytic space over a nonarchimedean field. Such spaces were introduced by John Tate in 1962, as an outgrowth of his work on uniformizing p-adic elliptic curves with bad reduction using the multiplicative group.  In contrast to the classical theory of p-adic analytic manifolds, rigid analytic spaces admit meaningful notions of analytic continuation and connectedness.","image":"4d9241493be76739f2400f258f32c24f9689161f.svg","url":"Rigid_analytic_space"}
