{"title":"Truth-table reduction","summary":"In computability theory, a truth-table reduction is a reduction from one set of natural numbers to another. As a \"tool\", it is weaker than Turing reduction, since not every Turing reduction between sets can be performed by a truth-table reduction, but every truth-table reduction can be performed by a Turing reduction. For the same reason it is said to be a stronger reducibility than Turing reducibility, because it implies Turing reducibility. A weak truth-table reduction is a related type of reduction which is so named because it weakens the constraints placed on a truth-table reduction, and provides a weaker equivalence classification; as such, a \"weak truth-table reduction\" can actually be more powerful than a truth-table reduction as a \"tool\", and perform a reduction which is not performable by truth table.","image":"b067053df88cdea896138dbde51a34a8778fe45b.svg","url":"Truth-table_reduction"}
