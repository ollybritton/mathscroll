{"title":"Conjugacy class","summary":"In mathematics, especially group theory, two elements a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} of a group are conjugate if there is an element g {\\displaystyle g} in the group such that b = g a g − 1 . {\\displaystyle b=gag^{-1}.} This is an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are called conjugacy classes.  In other words, each conjugacy class is closed under b = g a g − 1 {\\displaystyle b=gag^{-1}} for all elements g {\\displaystyle g} in the group.","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"Conjugacy_class"}
