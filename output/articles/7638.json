{"title":"Idoneal number","summary":"In mathematics, Euler's idoneal numbers (also called  suitable numbers or convenient numbers) are the positive integers D such that any integer expressible in only one way as x2 ± Dy2 (where x2 is relatively prime to Dy2) is a prime power or twice a prime power. In particular, a number that has two distinct representations as a sum of two squares is composite. Every idoneal number generates a set containing infinitely many primes and missing infinitely many other primes.","image":"Symbol_portal_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Idoneal_number"}
