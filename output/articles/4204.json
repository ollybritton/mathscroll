{"title":"Dirichlet's unit theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Dirichlet's unit theorem is a basic result in algebraic number theory due to Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.[1] It determines the rank of the group of units in the ring OK of algebraic integers of a number field K. The regulator is a positive real number that determines how \"dense\" the units are.","image":"830ec6a7ff9b48ef79d3e0f301ce7c3c881fc061.svg","url":"Dirichlet's_unit_theorem"}
