{"title":"FK-space","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics a FK-space or Fréchet coordinate space is a sequence space equipped with a topological structure such that it becomes a Fréchet space. FK-spaces with a normable topology are called BK-spaces.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"FK-space"}
