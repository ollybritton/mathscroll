{"title":"Stromquist–Woodall theorem","summary":"The Stromquist–Woodall theorem is a theorem in fair division and measure theory. Informally, it says that, for any cake, for any n people with different tastes, and for any fraction w, there exists a subset of the cake that all people value at exactly a fraction w of the total cake value, and it can be cut using at most 2 n − 2 {\\displaystyle 2n-2} cuts.[1]","image":"a8593ff30008d016680ae67c34865b96087b62fa.svg","url":"Stromquist–Woodall_theorem"}
