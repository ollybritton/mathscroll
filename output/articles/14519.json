{"title":"Slope","summary":"In mathematics, the slope or gradient of a line is a number that describes both the direction and the steepness of the line.[1] Slope is often denoted by the letter m; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter m is used for slope, but its earliest use in English appears in O'Brien (1844)[2] who wrote the equation of a straight line as \"y = mx + b\" and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888)[3] who wrote it as \"y = mx + c\".[4]","image":"Wiki_slope_in_2d.svg.png.webp","url":"Slope"}
