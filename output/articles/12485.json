{"title":"Prime element","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in abstract algebra, a prime element of a commutative ring is an object satisfying certain properties similar to the prime numbers in the integers and to irreducible polynomials. Care should be taken to distinguish prime elements from irreducible elements, a concept which is the same in UFDs but not the same in general.","image":"84ed4e4e8f7026e55edc2e4c5f68e4fc9c93da46.svg","url":"Prime_element"}
