{"title":"Isomorphism","summary":"In mathematics, an isomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. Two mathematical structures are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them.  The word isomorphism is derived from the Ancient Greek: ἴσος isos \"equal\", and μορφή morphe \"form\" or \"shape\".","image":"One5Root.svg.png.webp","url":"Isomorphism"}
