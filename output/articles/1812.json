{"title":"Bolza surface","summary":"In mathematics, the Bolza surface, alternatively, complex algebraic Bolza curve (introduced by Oskar Bolza (1887)), is a compact Riemann surface of genus 2 {\\displaystyle 2} with the highest possible order of the conformal automorphism group in this genus, namely G L 2 ( 3 ) {\\displaystyle GL_{2}(3)} of order 48 (the general linear group of 2 × 2 {\\displaystyle 2\\times 2} matrices over the finite field F 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{3}} ). The full automorphism group (including reflections) is the semi-direct product G L 2 ( 3 ) ⋊ Z 2 {\\displaystyle GL_{2}(3)\\rtimes \\mathbb {Z} _{2}} of order 96. An affine model for the Bolza surface can be obtained as the locus of the equation","image":"901fc910c19990d0dbaaefe4726ceb1a4e217a0f.svg","url":"Bolza_surface"}
