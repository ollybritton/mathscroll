{"title":"Pseudo-arc","summary":"In general topology, the pseudo-arc is the simplest nondegenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum.  The pseudo-arc is an arc-like homogeneous continuum, and played a central role in the classification of homogeneous planar continua. R. H. Bing proved that, in a certain well-defined sense, most continua in Rn, n â‰¥ 2, are homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.","image":"b920d46c79630bc7e94a8939ad6b4b45291ee177.svg","url":"Pseudo-arc"}
