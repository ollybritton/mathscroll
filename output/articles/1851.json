{"title":"Borel functional calculus","summary":"In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Borel functional calculus is a functional calculus (that is, an assignment of operators from commutative algebras to functions defined on their spectra), which has particularly broad scope.[1][2] Thus for instance if T is an operator, applying the squaring function s → s2 to T yields the operator T2. Using the functional calculus for larger classes of functions, we can for example define rigorously the \"square root\" of the (negative) Laplacian operator −Δ or the exponential e i t Δ . {\\displaystyle e^{it\\Delta }.}","image":"7477d2f76a6be4d594390fd2dd44872b9ed8667e.svg","url":"Borel_functional_calculus"}
