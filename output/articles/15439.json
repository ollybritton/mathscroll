{"title":"Szpiro's conjecture","summary":"In number theory, Szpiro's conjecture relates to the conductor and the discriminant of an elliptic curve.  In a slightly modified form, it is equivalent to the well-known abc conjecture.  It is named for Lucien Szpiro, who formulated it in the 1980s. Szpiro's conjecture and its equivalent forms have been described as \"the most important unsolved problem in Diophantine analysis\" by Dorian Goldfeld,[1] in part to its large number of consequences in number theory including Roth's theorem, the Mordell conjecture, the Fermatâ€“Catalan conjecture, and Brocard's problem.[2][3][4][5]","image":"60ed918a2e85ff01e8d5b3c7dbfbcb81569799d2.svg","url":"Szpiro's_conjecture"}
