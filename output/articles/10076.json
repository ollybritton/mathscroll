{"title":"Mathematical induction","summary":"Mathematical induction is a method for proving that a statement P ( n ) {\\displaystyle P(n)} is true for every natural number n {\\displaystyle n} , that is, that the infinitely many cases P ( 0 ) , P ( 1 ) , P ( 2 ) , P ( 3 ) , â€¦ {\\displaystyle P(0),P(1),P(2),P(3),\\dots } all hold. Informal metaphors help to explain this technique, such as falling dominoes or climbing a ladder:","image":"5e303d2c14cd399b6f52b468c9fd44a542bed422.svg","url":"Mathematical_induction"}
