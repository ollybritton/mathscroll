{"title":"Chomsky–Schützenberger representation theorem","summary":"In formal language theory, the Chomsky–Schützenberger representation theorem is a theorem derived by Noam Chomsky and Marcel-Paul Schützenberger about representing a given context-free language in terms of two simpler languages. These two simpler languages, namely a regular language and a Dyck language, are combined by means of an intersection and a homomorphism.","image":"b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a.svg","url":"Chomsky–Schützenberger_representation_theorem"}
