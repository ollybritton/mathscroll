{"title":"Torsion of a curve","summary":"In the differential geometry of curves in three dimensions, the torsion of a curve measures how sharply it is twisting out of the osculating plane.  Taken together, the curvature and the torsion of a space curve are analogous to the curvature of a plane curve. For example, they are coefficients in the system of differential equations for the Frenet frame given by the Frenetâ€“Serret formulas.","image":"Torus-Knot_uebereinander_animated.gif","url":"Torsion_of_a_curve"}
