{"title":"Ptolemy's theorem","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, Ptolemy's theorem is a relation between the four sides and two diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral whose vertices lie on a common circle). The theorem is named after the Greek astronomer and mathematician Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus).[1] Ptolemy used the theorem as an aid to creating his table of chords, a trigonometric table that he applied to astronomy.","image":"Ptolemy_equality.svg.png.webp","url":"Ptolemy's_theorem"}
