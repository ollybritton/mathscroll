{"title":"Singular submodule","summary":"In the branches of abstract algebra known as ring theory and module theory, each right (resp. left) R-module M has a singular submodule consisting of elements whose annihilators are essential right (resp. left) ideals in R.  In set notation it is usually denoted as Z ( M ) = { m ∈ M ∣ a n n ( m ) ⊆ e R } {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {Z}}(M)=\\{m\\in M\\mid \\mathrm {ann} (m)\\subseteq _{e}R\\}\\,} .  For general rings, Z ( M ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {Z}}(M)} is a good generalization of the torsion submodule tors(M) which is most often defined for domains.  In the case that R is a commutative domain, tors ⁡ ( M ) = Z ( M ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {tors} (M)={\\mathcal {Z}}(M)} .","image":"035bac3eda36d336b0944bd1651b238a23645920.svg","url":"Singular_submodule"}
