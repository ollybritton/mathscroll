{"title":"Multibrot set","summary":"In mathematics, a Multibrot set is the set of values in the complex plane whose absolute value remains below some finite value throughout iterations by a member of the general monic univariate polynomial family of recursions.[1][2][3] The name is a portmanteau of multiple and Mandelbrot set. The same can be applied to the Julia set, this being called Multijulia set.","image":"c6a38dbe0ebc2eca067bdeb4e358b0973d0e45c4.svg","url":"Multibrot_set"}
