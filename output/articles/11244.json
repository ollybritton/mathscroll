{"title":"Normed vector space","summary":"In mathematics, a normed vector space or normed space is a vector space over the real or complex numbers, on which a norm is defined.[1] A norm is the formalization and the generalization to real vector spaces of the intuitive notion of \"length\" in the real (physical) world. A norm is a real-valued function defined on the vector space that is commonly denoted x ↦ ‖ x ‖ , {\\displaystyle x\\mapsto \\|x\\|,} and has the following properties:[2]","image":"30783b1dd032dafc4f79166985a682ad83b512be.svg","url":"Normed_vector_space"}
