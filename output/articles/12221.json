{"title":"Pluriharmonic function","summary":"In mathematics, precisely in the theory of functions of several complex variables, a pluriharmonic function is a real valued function which is locally the real part of a holomorphic function of several complex variables. Sometimes  such a function is referred to as n-harmonic function, where n â‰¥ 2 is the dimension of the complex domain where the function is defined.[1] However, in modern expositions of the theory of functions of several complex variables[2] it is preferred to give an equivalent formulation of the concept, by defining pluriharmonic function a complex valued function whose restriction to every complex line is a harmonic function with respect to the real and imaginary part of the complex line parameter.","image":"febca9f14dfe8bdfb3a29b0b22a0b559e67a8e83.svg","url":"Pluriharmonic_function"}
