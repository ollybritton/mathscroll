{"title":"Bitopological space","summary":"In mathematics, a bitopological space is a set endowed with two topologies. Typically, if the set is X {\\displaystyle X} and the topologies are σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } and τ {\\displaystyle \\tau } then the bitopological space is referred to as ( X , σ , τ ) {\\displaystyle (X,\\sigma ,\\tau )} . The notion was introduced by J. C. Kelly in the study of quasimetrics, i.e. distance functions that are not required to be symmetric.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Bitopological_space"}
