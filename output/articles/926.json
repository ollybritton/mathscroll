{"title":"Approximation error","summary":"The approximation error in a data value is the discrepancy between an exact value and some approximation to it. This error can be expressed as an absolute error (the numerical amount of the discrepancy) or as a relative error (the absolute error divided by the data value).","image":"E^x_with_linear_approximation.png.webp","url":"Approximation_error"}
