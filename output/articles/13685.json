{"title":"Rolle's theorem","summary":"In calculus, Rolle's theorem or Rolle's lemma essentially states that any real-valued differentiable function that attains equal values at two distinct points must have at least one stationary point somewhere between themâ€”that is, a point where the first derivative (the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function) is zero. The theorem is named after Michel Rolle.","image":"RTCalc.svg.png.webp","url":"Rolle's_theorem"}
