{"title":"Arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold","summary":"In mathematics, more precisely in group theory and hyperbolic geometry, Arithmetic Kleinian groups are a special class of Kleinian groups constructed using orders in quaternion algebras. They are particular instances of arithmetic groups. An arithmetic hyperbolic three-manifold is the quotient of hyperbolic space H 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} ^{3}} by an arithmetic Kleinian group.","image":"068bb76291b210b52f31eef3981f1c7311a24204.svg","url":"Arithmetic_hyperbolic_3-manifold"}
