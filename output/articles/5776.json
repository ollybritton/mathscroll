{"title":"Frobenius theorem (differential topology)","summary":"In mathematics, Frobenius' theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for finding a maximal set of independent solutions of an overdetermined system  of first-order homogeneous linear partial differential equations. In modern geometric terms, given a family of vector fields, the theorem gives necessary and sufficient integrability conditions for the existence of a foliation by maximal integral manifolds whose tangent bundles are spanned by the given vector fields. The theorem generalizes the existence theorem for ordinary differential equations, which guarantees that a single vector field always gives rise to integral curves; Frobenius gives compatibility conditions under which the integral curves of r vector fields mesh into coordinate grids on r-dimensional integral manifolds.  The theorem is foundational in differential topology and calculus on manifolds.","image":"3306eb1d3f4cdce128037f3cd2a4cc59f42bad6b.svg","url":"Frobenius_theorem_(differential_topology)"}
