{"title":"Formula for primes","summary":"In number theory, a formula for primes is a formula generating the prime numbers, exactly and without exception. No such formula which is efficiently computable is known. A number of constraints are known, showing what such a \"formula\" can and cannot be.","image":"dd29d87778ae21fbcbcb26c8ecc771650bb0f5b0.svg","url":"Formula_for_primes"}
