{"title":"Heptagonal tiling honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the heptagonal tiling honeycomb or 7,3,3 honeycomb a regular space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). Each infinite cell consists of a heptagonal tiling whose vertices lie on a 2-hypercycle, each of which has a limiting circle on the ideal sphere.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Heptagonal_tiling_honeycomb"}
