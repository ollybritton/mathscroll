{"title":"Near sets","summary":"In mathematics, near sets are either spatially close or descriptively close. Spatially close sets have nonempty intersection. In other words, spatially close sets are not disjoint sets, since they always have at least one element in common. Descriptively close sets contain elements that have matching descriptions. Such sets can be either disjoint or non-disjoint sets. Spatially near sets are also descriptively near sets.","image":"Minimally_Descriptive_Near_Sets.svg.png.webp","url":"Near_sets"}
