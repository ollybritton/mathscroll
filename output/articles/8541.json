{"title":"K-transform","summary":"In mathematics, the K transform (also called the Kemp-Macdonald Transform or Single-Pixel X-ray Transform) is an integral transform introduced by R. Scott Kemp and Ruaridh Macdonald in 2016.[1] The transform allows a 3-dimensional inhomogeneous object to be reconstructed from scalar point measurements taken in the volume external to the object.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"K-transform"}
