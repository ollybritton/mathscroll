{"title":"Reeb graph","summary":"A Reeb graph[1] (named after Georges Reeb by René Thom) is a mathematical object reflecting the evolution of the level sets of a real-valued function on a manifold.[2] According to [3] a similar concept was introduced by G.M. Adelson-Velskii and A.S. Kronrod and applied to analysis of Hilbert's thirteenth problem.[4] Proposed by G. Reeb as a tool in Morse theory,[5] Reeb graphs are the natural tool to study multivalued functional relationships between 2D scalar fields ψ {\\displaystyle \\psi } , λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } , and ϕ {\\displaystyle \\phi } arising from the conditions ∇ ψ = λ ∇ ϕ {\\displaystyle \\nabla \\psi =\\lambda \\nabla \\phi } and λ ≠ 0 {\\displaystyle \\lambda \\neq 0} , because these relationships are single-valued when restricted to a region associated with an individual edge of the Reeb graph. This general principle was first used to study neutral surfaces in oceanography.[6]","image":"45e5789e5d9c8f7c79744f43ecaaf8ba42a8553a.svg","url":"Reeb_graph"}
