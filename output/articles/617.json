{"title":"Algebraic variety","summary":"Algebraic varieties are the central objects of study in algebraic geometry, a sub-field of mathematics. Classically, an algebraic variety is defined as the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations over the real or complex numbers. Modern definitions generalize this concept in several different ways, while attempting to preserve the geometric intuition behind the original definition.[1]:â€Š58","image":"Twisted_cubic_curve.png.webp","url":"Algebraic_variety"}
