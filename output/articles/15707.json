{"title":"Thiele's interpolation formula","summary":"In mathematics, Thiele's interpolation formula is a formula that defines a rational function f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} from a finite set of inputs x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} and their function values f ( x i ) {\\displaystyle f(x_{i})} . The problem of generating a function whose graph passes through a given set of function values is called interpolation. This interpolation formula is named after the Danish mathematician Thorvald N. Thiele. It is expressed as a continued fraction, where œÅ represents the reciprocal difference:","image":"202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074.svg","url":"Thiele's_interpolation_formula"}
