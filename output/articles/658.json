{"title":"Almost all","summary":"In mathematics, the term \"almost all\" means \"all but a negligible amount\". More precisely, if X {\\displaystyle X} is a set, \"almost all elements of X {\\displaystyle X} \" means \"all elements of X {\\displaystyle X} but those in a negligible subset of X {\\displaystyle X} \".
