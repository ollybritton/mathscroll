{"title":"Eisenstein integral","summary":"In mathematical representation theory, the Eisenstein integral is an integral introduced by Harish-Chandra[1] in the representation theory of semisimple Lie groups, analogous to Eisenstein series in the theory of automorphic forms. Harish-Chandra used Eisenstein integrals to decompose the regular representation of a semisimple Lie group into representations induced from parabolic subgroups.[2] Trombi gave a survey of Harish-Chandra's work on this.[3]","image":"a924505b3813daa74d298e761fc502dda844df9a.svg","url":"Eisenstein_integral"}
