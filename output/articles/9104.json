{"title":"Leaf power","summary":"In the mathematical area of graph theory, a k-leaf power of a tree T is a graph G whose vertices are the leaves of T and whose edges connect pairs of leaves whose distance in T is at most k. That is, G is an induced subgraph of the graph power T k {\\displaystyle T^{k}} , induced by the leaves of T. For a graph G constructed in this way, T is called a k-leaf root of G.","image":"771fc765e0c47ac0e39f69ad85769d55022c944d.svg","url":"Leaf_power"}
