{"title":"Finite ring","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically abstract algebra, a finite ring is a ring that has a finite number of elements. Every finite field is an example of a finite ring, and the additive part of every finite ring is an example of an abelian finite group, but the concept of finite rings in their own right has a more recent history.","image":"d4b0bfca6971f8476fe7052366fe37b56dcbfc5e.svg","url":"Finite_ring"}
