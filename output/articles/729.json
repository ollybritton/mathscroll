{"title":"Amortized analysis","summary":"In computer science, amortized analysis is a method for analyzing a given algorithm's complexity, or how much of a resource, especially time or memory, it takes to execute.  The motivation for amortized analysis is that looking at the worst-case run time can be too pessimistic.  Instead, amortized analysis averages the running times of operations in a sequence over that sequence.[1]: 306 As a conclusion: \"Amortized analysis is a useful tool that complements other techniques such as worst-case and average-case analysis.\"[2]: 14","image":"AmortizedPush.png.webp","url":"Amortized_analysis"}
