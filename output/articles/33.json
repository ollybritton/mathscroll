{"title":"1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ⋯","summary":"In mathematics, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ⋯ is the infinite series whose terms are the successive powers of two. As a geometric series, it is characterized by its first term, 1, and its common ratio, 2. As a series of real numbers it diverges to infinity, so the sum of this series is infinity.","image":"Partial_sums_of_1%2B2%2B3%2B4.jpg.webp","url":"1_+_2_+_4_+_8_+_⋯"}
