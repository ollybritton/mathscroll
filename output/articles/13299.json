{"title":"Regressive discrete Fourier series","summary":"In applied mathematics, the regressive discrete Fourier series (RDFS) is a generalization of the discrete Fourier transform where the Fourier series coefficients are computed in a least squares sense and the period is arbitrary, i.e., not necessarily equal to the length of the data.  It was first proposed by Arruda (1992a, 1992b). It can be used to smooth data in one or more dimensions and to compute derivatives from the smoothed curve, surface, or hypersurface.","image":"6714fe048cf1ebcd057f7e1817c1001252a1003f.svg","url":"Regressive_discrete_Fourier_series"}
