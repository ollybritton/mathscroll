{"title":"Axonometry","summary":"Axonometry is a graphical procedure belonging to descriptive geometry that generates a planar image of a three-dimensional object. The term \"axonometry\" means \"to measure along axes\", and indicates that the dimensions and scaling of the coordinate axes play a crucial role. The result of an axonometric procedure is a uniformly-scaled parallel projection of the object. In general, the resulting parallel projection is oblique (the rays are not perpendicular to the image plane); but in special cases the result is orthographic (the rays are perpendicular to the image plane), which in this context is called an orthogonal axonometry.","image":"Axonometrie-torbogen-c.svg.png.webp","url":"Axonometry"}
