{"title":"Predictor–corrector method","summary":"In numerical analysis, predictor–corrector methods belong to a class of algorithms designed to integrate ordinary differential equations – to find an unknown function that satisfies a given differential equation.  All such algorithms proceed in two steps:","image":"6fcd1a6073091b6674d1c1fd5ed2276b02f37b8b.svg","url":"Predictor–corrector_method"}
