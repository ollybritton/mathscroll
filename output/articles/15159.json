{"title":"Structural Ramsey theory","summary":"In mathematics, structural Ramsey theory is a categorical generalisation of Ramsey theory, rooted in the idea that many important results of Ramsey theory have \"similar\" logical structure. The key observation is noting that these Ramsey-type theorems can be expressed as the assertion that a certain category (or class of finite structures) has the Ramsey property (defined below).","image":"d059936e77a2d707e9ee0a1d9575a1d693ce5d0b.svg","url":"Structural_Ramsey_theory"}
