{"title":"Support polygon","summary":"For a rigid object in contact with a fixed environment and acted upon by gravity in the vertical direction, its support polygon is a horizontal region over which the center of mass must lie to achieve static stability.[1]  For example, for an object resting on a horizontal surface (e.g. a table), the support polygon is the convex hull of its \"footprint\" on the table.","image":"b85e722aae5ce35069e4e2202c193e19a2e12ffb.svg","url":"Support_polygon"}
