{"title":"List of mathematical jargon","summary":"The language of mathematics has a vast vocabulary of specialist and technical terms. It also has a certain amount of jargon: commonly used phrases which are part of the culture of mathematics, rather than of the subject. Jargon often appears in lectures, and sometimes in print, as informal shorthand for rigorous arguments or precise ideas. Much of this is common English, but with a specific non-obvious meaning when used in a mathematical sense.","image":"ead64908b98f6afa779f4134dc9696816dc8ec60.svg","url":"List_of_mathematical_jargon"}
