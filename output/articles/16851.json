{"title":"Weyl's inequality","summary":"In linear algebra, Weyl's inequality is a theorem about the changes to eigenvalues of an Hermitian matrix that is perturbed.  It can be used to estimate the eigenvalues of a perturbed Hermitian matrix.","image":"519783a95b44c84825ecc366c02043f4bc9c23e9.svg","url":"Weyl's_inequality"}
