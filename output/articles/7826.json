{"title":"Innumeracy (book)","summary":"Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences is a 1988 book by mathematician John Allen Paulos about innumeracy (deficiency of numeracy) as the mathematical equivalent of illiteracy: incompetence with numbers rather than words. Innumeracy is a problem with many otherwise educated and knowledgeable people. While many people would be ashamed to admit they are illiterate, there is very little shame in admitting innumeracy by saying things like \"I'm a people person, not a numbers person\", or \"I always hated math\",[1]: 3–6 [2][3][4] but Paulos challenges whether that widespread cultural excusing of innumeracy is truly worthy of acceptability.[1]: 3–6","image":"Innumeracy.jpg.webp","url":"Innumeracy_(book)"}
