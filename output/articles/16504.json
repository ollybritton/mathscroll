{"title":"Van der Waerden's theorem","summary":"Van der Waerden's theorem is a theorem in the branch of mathematics called Ramsey theory.  Van der Waerden's theorem states that for any given positive integers r and k, there is some number N such that if the integers {1, 2, ..., N} are colored, each with one of r different colors, then there are at least k integers in arithmetic progression whose elements are of the same color. The least such N is the Van der Waerden number W(r,Â k), named after the Dutch mathematician B. L. van der Waerden.[1]","image":"2669cc1c37102db4a84ad89e50da23af52284c4c.svg","url":"Van_der_Waerden's_theorem"}
