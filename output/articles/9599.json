{"title":"Local World Evolving Network Models","summary":"Evolving networks are dynamic networks that change through time.  In each period t {\\displaystyle t} there are new nodes and edges that join the network while the old ones disappear.  Such dynamic behaviour is characteristic for most real-world networks, regardless of their range - global or local. However, networks differ not only in their range but also in their topological structure. It is possible to distinguish:","image":"65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560.svg","url":"Local_World_Evolving_Network_Models"}
