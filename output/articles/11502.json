{"title":"Order-6 hexagonal tiling honeycomb","summary":"In the field of hyperbolic geometry, the order-6 hexagonal tiling honeycomb is one of 11 regular paracompact honeycombs in 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. It is paracompact because it has cells with an infinite number of faces.  Each cell is a hexagonal tiling whose vertices lie on a horosphere: a flat plane in hyperbolic space that approaches a single ideal point at infinity.","image":"H3_636_FC_boundary.png.webp","url":"Order-6_hexagonal_tiling_honeycomb"}
