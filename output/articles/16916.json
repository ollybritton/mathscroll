{"title":"Wigner D-matrix","summary":"The Wigner D-matrix is a unitary matrix in an irreducible representation of the groups SU(2) and SO(3). It was introduced in 1927 by Eugene Wigner, and plays a fundamental role in the quantum mechanical theory of angular momentum. The complex conjugate of the D-matrix is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian of spherical and symmetric rigid rotors. The letter D stands for Darstellung, which means \"representation\" in German.","image":"174ba69063f90a76d451af6dea3b8e8519411e7c.svg","url":"Wigner_D-matrix"}
