{"title":"Aczel's anti-foundation axiom","summary":"In the foundations of mathematics, Aczel's anti-foundation axiom is an axiom set forth by Peter Aczel (1988), as an alternative to the axiom of foundation in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. It states that every accessible pointed directed graph corresponds to exactly one set.  In particular, according to this axiom, the graph consisting of a single vertex with a loop corresponds to a set that contains only itself as element, i.e. a Quine atom. A set theory obeying this axiom is necessarily a non-well-founded set theory.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Aczel's_anti-foundation_axiom"}
