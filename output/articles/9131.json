{"title":"Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration","summary":"In measure-theoretic analysis and related branches of mathematics, Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration generalizes both Riemann–Stieltjes and Lebesgue integration, preserving the many advantages of the former in a more general measure-theoretic framework.  The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is the ordinary Lebesgue integral with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of bounded variation on the real line.  The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a regular Borel measure, and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.","image":"101e683cb82bc44e2cf78fbbb7d449755c9e3911.svg","url":"Lebesgue–Stieltjes_integration"}
