{"title":"Polarization (Lie algebra)","summary":"In representation theory, polarization is the maximal totally isotropic subspace of a certain skew-symmetric bilinear form on a Lie algebra. The notion of polarization plays an important role in construction of irreducible unitary representations of some classes of Lie groups by means of the orbit method[1] as well as in harmonic analysis on Lie groups and mathematical physics.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Polarization_(Lie_algebra)"}
