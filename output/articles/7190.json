{"title":"Hierarchy (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a hierarchy is a set-theoretical object, consisting of a preorder defined on a set. This is often referred to as an ordered set, though that is an ambiguous term that many authors reserve for partially ordered sets or totally ordered sets. The term pre-ordered set is unambiguous, and is always synonymous with a mathematical hierarchy. The term hierarchy is used to stress a hierarchical relation among the elements.","image":"418e0399d2bc6effbf031c7e9b8ca09752453698.svg","url":"Hierarchy_(mathematics)"}
