{"title":"Kleene's algorithm","summary":"In theoretical computer science, in particular in formal language theory, Kleene's algorithm transforms a given nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) into a regular expression. Together with other conversion algorithms, it establishes the equivalence of several description formats for regular languages. Alternative presentations of the same method include the \"elimination method\" attributed to Brzozowski and McCluskey, the algorithm of McNaughton and Yamada,[1] and the use of Arden's lemma.","image":"Deterministicfiniteautomaton.svg.png.webp","url":"Kleene's_algorithm"}
