{"title":"Gibbs phenomenon","summary":"In mathematics, the Gibbs phenomenon is the oscillatory behavior of the Fourier series of a piecewise continuously differentiable periodic function around a jump discontinuity. The function's N {\\displaystyle N} th partial Fourier series (formed by summing its N {\\displaystyle N} lowest constituent sinusoids) produces large peaks around the jump which overshoot and undershoot the function's actual values. This approximation error approaches a limit of about 9% of the jump as more sinusoids are used, though the infinite Fourier series sum does eventually converge almost everywhere except the point of discontinuity.[1]","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Gibbs_phenomenon"}
