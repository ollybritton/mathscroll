{"title":"Hilbert's theorem (differential geometry)","summary":"In differential geometry, Hilbert's theorem (1901) states that there exists no complete regular surface S {\\displaystyle S} of constant negative gaussian curvature K {\\displaystyle K} immersed in R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} . This theorem answers the question for the negative case of which surfaces in R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} can be obtained by isometrically immersing complete manifolds with constant curvature.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Hilbert's_theorem_(differential_geometry)"}
