{"title":"New Foundations","summary":"In mathematical logic, New Foundations (NF) is an axiomatic set theory, conceived by Willard Van Orman Quine as a simplification of the theory of types of Principia Mathematica. Quine first proposed NF in a 1937 article titled \"New Foundations for Mathematical Logic\"; hence the name. Much of this entry discusses NF with urelements (NFU), an important variant of NF due to Jensen[1] and clarified by Holmes.[2] In 1940 and in a revision in 1951, Quine introduced an extension of NF sometimes called \"Mathematical Logic\" or \"ML\", that included proper classes as well as sets.","image":"505a4ceef454c69dffd23792c84b90f488543743.svg","url":"New_Foundations"}
