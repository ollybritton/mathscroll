{"title":"Affine connection","summary":"In differential geometry, an affine connection[lower-alpha 1] is a geometric object on a smooth manifold which connects nearby tangent spaces, so it permits tangent vector fields to be differentiated as if they were functions on the manifold with values in a fixed vector space. Connections are among the simplest methods of defining differentiation of the sections of vector bundles.[3]","image":"Parallel_transport_sphere.svg.png.webp","url":"Affine_connection"}
