{"title":"1-planar graph","summary":"In topological graph theory, a 1-planar graph is a graph that can be drawn in the Euclidean plane in such a way that each edge has at most one crossing point, where it crosses a single additional edge. If a 1-planar graph, one of the most natural generalizations of planar graphs, is drawn that way, the drawing is called a 1-plane graph or 1-planar embedding of the graph.","image":"3-crossing_Heawood_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"1-planar_graph"}
