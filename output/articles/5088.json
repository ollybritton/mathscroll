{"title":"Eulerian number","summary":"In combinatorics, the Eulerian number A(n, m) is the number of permutations of the numbers 1 to n in which exactly m elements are greater than the previous element (permutations with m \"ascents\"). They are the coefficients of the Eulerian polynomials:","image":"2482ca8ff29ff094cf42f6ea951b4b569abaabce.svg","url":"Eulerian_number"}
