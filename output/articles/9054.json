{"title":"Lattice (discrete subgroup)","summary":"In Lie theory and related areas of mathematics, a lattice in a locally compact group is a discrete subgroup with the property that the quotient space has finite invariant measure. In the special case of subgroups of Rn, this amounts to the usual geometric notion of a lattice as a periodic subset of points, and both the algebraic structure of lattices and the geometry of the space of all lattices are relatively well understood.","image":"HeisenbergCayleyGraph.png.webp","url":"Lattice_(discrete_subgroup)"}
