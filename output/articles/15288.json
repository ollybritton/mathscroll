{"title":"Supersolvable group","summary":"In mathematics, a group is supersolvable (or supersoluble) if it has an invariant normal series where all the factors are cyclic groups.  Supersolvability is stronger than the notion of solvability.","image":"ee520938cd67f7490bbb948192c9a74e177ef0bc.svg","url":"Supersolvable_group"}
