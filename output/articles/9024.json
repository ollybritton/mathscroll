{"title":"Laplace transform applied to differential equations","summary":"In mathematics, the Laplace transform is a powerful integral transform used to switch a function from the time domain to the s-domain. The Laplace transform can be used in some cases to solve linear differential equations with given initial conditions.","image":"38c4778e0226d35ab990383602960a029c80af87.svg","url":"Laplace_transform_applied_to_differential_equations"}
