{"title":"Petr Vopěnka","summary":"Petr Vopěnka (16 May 1935 – 20 March 2015) was a Czech mathematician. In the early seventies, he developed alternative set theory (i.e. alternative to the classical Cantor theory), which he subsequently developed in a series of articles and monographs.  Vopěnka’s name is associated with many mathematical achievements,[1][2] including Vopěnka's principle. Since the mid-eighties he concerned himself with philosophical questions of mathematics (particularly vis-à-vis Husserlian phenomenology).","image":"Vopenka.jpg.webp","url":"Petr_Vopěnka"}
