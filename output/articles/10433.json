{"title":"Microbundle","summary":"In mathematics, a microbundle is a generalization of the concept of vector bundle, introduced by the American mathematician John Milnor in 1964.[1] It allows the creation of bundle-like objects in situations where they would not ordinarily be thought to exist. For example, the tangent bundle is defined for a smooth manifold but not a topological manifold; use of microbundles allows the definition of a topological tangent bundle.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Microbundle"}
