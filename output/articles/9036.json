{"title":"Large deviations of Gaussian random functions","summary":"A random function – of either one variable (a random process), or two or more variables (a random field) – is called Gaussian if every finite-dimensional distribution is a multivariate normal distribution. Gaussian random fields on the sphere are useful (for example) when analysing","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Large_deviations_of_Gaussian_random_functions"}
