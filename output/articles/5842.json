{"title":"Functor represented by a scheme","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a functor represented by a scheme X is a set-valued contravariant functor on the category of schemes such that the value of the functor at each scheme S is (up to natural bijections) the set of all morphisms S â†’ X {\\displaystyle S\\to X} . The scheme X is then said to represent the functor and that classify geometric objects over S given by F.[1]","image":"5566629251250ba644683a256f3ae6b6ec516d8d.svg","url":"Functor_represented_by_a_scheme"}
