{"title":"Chi distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the chi distribution is a continuous probability distribution.  It is the distribution of the positive square root of the sum of squares of a set of independent random variables each following a standard normal distribution, or equivalently, the distribution of the Euclidean distance of the random variables from the origin. It is thus related to the chi-squared distribution by describing the distribution of the positive square roots of a variable obeying a chi-squared distribution.","image":"Chi_distribution_PDF.svg.png.webp","url":"Chi_distribution"}
