{"title":"Birth process","summary":"In probability theory, a birth process or a pure birth process[1] is a special case of a continuous-time Markov process and a generalisation of a Poisson process. It defines a continuous process which takes values in the natural numbers and can only increase by one (a \"birth\") or remain unchanged. This is a type of birthâ€“death process with no deaths. The rate at which births occur is given by an exponential random variable whose parameter depends only on the current value of the process","image":"Birth_process.svg.png.webp","url":"Birth_process"}
