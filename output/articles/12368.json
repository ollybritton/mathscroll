{"title":"Polytree","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a polytree[1] (also called directed tree,[2] oriented tree[3] or singly connected network[4]) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a tree. In other words, if we replace its directed edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected graph that is both connected and acyclic.","image":"Polytree.svg.png.webp","url":"Polytree"}
