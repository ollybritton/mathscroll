{"title":"Coupling (probability)","summary":"In probability theory, coupling is a proof technique that allows one to compare two unrelated random variables (distributions) X and Y by creating a random vector W whose marginal distributions correspond to X and Y respectively. The choice of W is generally not unique, and the whole idea of \"coupling\" is about making such a choice so that X and Y can be related in a particularly desirable way.","image":"f70b2694445a5901b24338a2e7a7e58f02a72a32.svg","url":"Coupling_(probability)"}
