{"title":"Pons asinorum","summary":"In geometry, the statement that the angles opposite the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are themselves equal is known as the pons asinorum (Latin: [ˈpõːs asɪˈnoːrũː], English: /ˈpɒnz ˌæsɪˈnɔːrəm/ PONZ ass-i-NOR-əm), typically translated as \"bridge of asses\". This statement is Proposition 5 of Book 1 in Euclid's Elements, and is also known as the isosceles triangle theorem.  Its converse is also true: if two angles of a triangle are equal, then the sides opposite them are also equal. The term is also applied to the Pythagorean theorem.[1]","image":"Byrne_Preface-15.png.webp","url":"Pons_asinorum"}
