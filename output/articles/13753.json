{"title":"Row equivalence","summary":"In linear algebra, two matrices are row equivalent if one can be changed to the other by a sequence of elementary row operations.  Alternatively, two m × n matrices are row equivalent if and only if they have the same row space.  The concept is most commonly applied to matrices that represent systems of linear equations, in which case two matrices of the same size are row equivalent if and only if the corresponding homogeneous systems have the same set of solutions, or equivalently the matrices have the same null space.","image":"92340931f2e8f636f8ebc0f27f658f47e5995b8f.svg","url":"Row_equivalence"}
