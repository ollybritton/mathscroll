{"title":"Shift space","summary":"In symbolic dynamics and related branches of mathematics, a shift space or subshift is a set of infinite words that represent the evolution of a discrete system. In fact, shift spaces and symbolic dynamical systems are often considered synonyms. The most widely studied shift spaces are the subshifts of finite type.","image":"0ecc5551b40e8c03343acce90db47d4a3d7bf4c4.svg","url":"Shift_space"}
