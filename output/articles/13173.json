{"title":"Real-root isolation","summary":"In mathematics, and, more specifically in numerical analysis and computer algebra, real-root isolation of a polynomial consist of producing disjoint intervals of the real line, which contain each one (and only one) real root of the polynomial, and, together, contain all the real roots of the polynomial.","image":"6421b3addc9a11e4872ed43ae1993cbd18ee3295.svg","url":"Real-root_isolation"}
