{"title":"Hopf decomposition","summary":"In mathematics, the Hopf decomposition, named after Eberhard Hopf, gives a canonical decomposition of a measure space  (X, μ) with respect to an invertible non-singular transformation T:X→X, i.e. a transformation which with its inverse is measurable and carries null sets onto null sets. Up to null sets, X can be written as a disjoint union C ∐ D of T-invariant sets where the action of T on C is conservative and the action of T on D is dissipative. Thus, if τ is the automorphism of A = L∞(X) induced by T, there is a unique τ-invariant projection p in A such that pA is conservative and (I–p)A is dissipative.","image":"ddb20b28c74cdaa09e1f101d426441da1996072f.svg","url":"Hopf_decomposition"}
