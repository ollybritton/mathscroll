{"title":"Feynman窶適ac formula","summary":"The Feynman窶適ac formula, named after Richard Feynman and Mark Kac, establishes a link between parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and stochastic processes. In 1947, when Kac and Feynman were both Cornell faculty, Kac attended a presentation of Feynman's and remarked that the two of them were working on the same thing from different directions.[1] The Feynman窶適ac formula resulted, which proves rigorously the real case of Feynman's path integrals. The complex case, which occurs when a particle's spin is included, is still an open question.[2]","image":"d6af699909b99302eebac643acedd8c382bb80b8.svg","url":"Feynman窶適ac_formula"}
