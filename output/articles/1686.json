{"title":"Biproduct","summary":"In category theory and its applications to mathematics, a biproduct of a finite collection of objects, in a category with zero objects, is both a product and a coproduct. In a preadditive category the notions of product and coproduct coincide for finite collections of objects.[1] The biproduct is a generalization of finite direct sums of modules.","image":"444c8c55839ce1900c4141ba83e6d24831745690.svg","url":"Biproduct"}
