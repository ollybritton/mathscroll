{"title":"Hausdorff paradox","summary":"The Hausdorff paradox is a paradox in mathematics named after Felix Hausdorff. It involves the sphere S 2 {\\displaystyle {S^{2}}} (a 3-dimensional sphere in R 3 {\\displaystyle {\\mathbb {R} ^{3}}} ). It states that if a certain countable subset is removed from S 2 {\\displaystyle {S^{2}}} , then the remainder can be divided into three disjoint subsets A , B {\\displaystyle {A,B}} and C {\\displaystyle {C}} such that A , B , C {\\displaystyle {A,B,C}} and B ∪ C {\\displaystyle {B\\cup C}} are all congruent. In particular, it follows that on S 2 {\\displaystyle S^{2}} there is no finitely additive measure defined on all subsets such that the measure of congruent sets is equal (because this would imply that the measure of B ∪ C {\\displaystyle {B\\cup C}} is simultaneously 1 / 3 {\\displaystyle 1/3} , 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle 1/2} , and 2 / 3 {\\displaystyle 2/3} of the non-zero measure of the whole sphere).","image":"20c13e9331e0c2e386ddba3c683ea791e6b5e9dc.svg","url":"Hausdorff_paradox"}
