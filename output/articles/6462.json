{"title":"Graph cut optimization","summary":"Graph cut optimization is a combinatorial optimization method applicable to a family of functions of discrete variables, named after the concept of cut in the theory of flow networks. Thanks to the max-flow min-cut theorem, determining the minimum cut over a graph representing a flow network is equivalent to computing the maximum flow over the network. Given a pseudo-Boolean function f {\\displaystyle f} , if it is possible to construct a flow network with positive weights such that","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Graph_cut_optimization"}
