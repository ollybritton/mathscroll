{"title":"Resolvent formalism","summary":"In mathematics, the resolvent formalism is a technique for applying concepts from complex analysis to the study of the spectrum of operators on Banach spaces and more general spaces. Formal justification for the manipulations can be found in the framework of holomorphic functional calculus.","image":"71cf60c18da4995914e32ca463367faf76cfb54c.svg","url":"Resolvent_formalism"}
