{"title":"Dual Hahn polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the dual Hahn polynomials are a family of orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. They are defined on a non-uniform lattice x ( s ) = s ( s + 1 ) {\\displaystyle x(s)=s(s+1)} and are defined as","image":"5565eed19642c4e6737e061c7e32013fe9f2b977.svg","url":"Dual_Hahn_polynomials"}
