{"title":"Quasiperfect number","summary":"In mathematics, a quasiperfect number is a natural number n for which the sum of all its divisors (the divisor function Ïƒ(n)) is equal to 2n + 1. Equivalently, n is the sum of its non-trivial divisors (that is, its divisors excluding 1 and n). No quasiperfect numbers have been found so far.","image":"Lattice_of_the_divisibility_of_60.svg.png.webp","url":"Quasiperfect_number"}
