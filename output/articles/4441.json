{"title":"Double centralizer theorem","summary":"In the branch of abstract algebra called ring theory, the double centralizer theorem can refer to any one of several similar results. These results concern the centralizer of a subring S of a ring R, denoted CR(S) in this article. It is always the case that CR(CR(S)) contains S, and a double centralizer theorem gives conditions on R and S that guarantee that CR(CR(S)) is equal to S.","image":"d192e43a10bad36b8040bae812392df5a729c962.svg","url":"Double_centralizer_theorem"}
