{"title":"Geiringer–Laman theorem","summary":"The Geiringer–Laman theorem gives a combinatorial characterization of generically rigid graphs in 2 {\\displaystyle 2} -dimensional Euclidean space, with respect to bar-joint frameworks.  This theorem was first proved by Hilda Pollaczek-Geiringer in 1927,[1] and later by Gerard Laman in 1970.[2]  An efficient algorithm called the Pebble Game is used to identify this class of graphs.[3]  This theorem has been the inspiration for many Geiringer-Laman type results for other types of frameworks with generalized Pebble games.[4]","image":"901fc910c19990d0dbaaefe4726ceb1a4e217a0f.svg","url":"Geiringer–Laman_theorem"}
