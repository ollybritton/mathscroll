{"title":"History of mathematical notation","summary":"The history of mathematical notation[1] includes the commencement, progress, and cultural diffusion of mathematical symbols and the conflict of the methods of notation confronted in a notation's move to popularity or inconspicuousness. Mathematical notation[2] comprises the symbols used to write mathematical equations and formulas. Notation generally implies a set of well-defined representations of quantities and symbols operators.[3] The history includes Hinduâ€“Arabic numerals, letters from the Roman, Greek, Hebrew, and German alphabets, and a host of symbols invented by mathematicians over the past several centuries.","image":"Ybc7289-bw.jpg.webp","url":"History_of_mathematical_notation"}
