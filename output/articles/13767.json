{"title":"Rule of division (combinatorics)","summary":"In combinatorics, the rule of division is a counting principle. It states that there are n/d ways to do a task if it can be done using a procedure that can be carried out in n ways, and for each way w, exactly d of the n ways correspond to the way w. In a nutshell, the division rule is a common way to ignore \"unimportant\" differences when counting things.[1]","image":"Round_table_rule_of_division.gif","url":"Rule_of_division_(combinatorics)"}
