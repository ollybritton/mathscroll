{"title":"Geometry of numbers","summary":"Geometry of numbers is the part of number theory which uses geometry for the study of algebraic numbers. Typically, a ring of algebraic integers is viewed as a lattice in R n , {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n},} and the study of these lattices provides fundamental information on algebraic numbers.[1] The geometry of numbers was initiated by Hermann MinkowskiÂ (1910).","image":"d7035fcb9fe3ebecc6bc9f372f82d0352202c8bf.svg","url":"Geometry_of_numbers"}
