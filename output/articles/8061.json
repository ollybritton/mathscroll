{"title":"Isocline","summary":"Given a family of curves, assumed to be differentiable, an isocline for that family is formed by the set of points at which some member of the family attains a given slope. The word comes from the Greek words ἴσος (isos), meaning \"same\", and the κλίνειν, meaning \"make to slope\". Generally, an isocline will itself have the shape of a curve or the union of a small number of curves.","image":"Isocline_3.png.webp","url":"Isocline"}
