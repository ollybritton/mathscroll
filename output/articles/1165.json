{"title":"Automorphic function","summary":"In mathematics, an automorphic function is a function on a space that is invariant under the action of some group, in other words a function on the quotient space.  Often the space is a complex manifold and the group is a discrete group.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Automorphic_function"}
