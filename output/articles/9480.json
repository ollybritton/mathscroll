{"title":"List of geodesic polyhedra and Goldberg polyhedra","summary":"This is a list of selected geodesic polyhedra and Goldberg polyhedra, two infinite classes of polyhedra. Geodesic polyhedra and Goldberg polyhedra are duals of each other. The geodesic and Goldberg polyhedra are parameterized by integers m and n, with m > 0 {\\displaystyle m>0} and n â‰¥ 0 {\\displaystyle n\\geq 0} . T is the triangulation number, which is equal to T = m 2 + m n + n 2 {\\displaystyle T=m^{2}+mn+n^{2}} .","image":"501173910e6da8425b4e9d44a4e8643620bc2464.svg","url":"List_of_geodesic_polyhedra_and_Goldberg_polyhedra"}
