{"title":"Uniform continuity","summary":"In mathematics, a real function f {\\displaystyle f} of real numbers is said to be uniformly continuous if there is a positive real number δ {\\displaystyle \\delta } such that function values over any function domain interval of the size δ {\\displaystyle \\delta } are as close to each other as we want. In other words, for a uniformly continuous real function of real numbers, if we want function value differences to be less than any positive real number ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } , then there is a positive real number δ {\\displaystyle \\delta } such that | f ( x ) − f ( y ) | < ϵ {\\displaystyle |f(x)-f(y)|<\\epsilon } at any x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} in any function interval of the size δ {\\displaystyle \\delta } .","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Uniform_continuity"}
