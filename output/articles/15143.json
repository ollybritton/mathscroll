{"title":"Strong connectivity augmentation","summary":"Strong connectivity augmentation is a computational problem in the mathematical study of graph algorithms, in which the input is a directed graph and the goal of the problem is to add a small number of edges, or a set of edges with small total weight, so that the added edges make the graph into a strongly connected graph.","image":"01d131dfd7673938b947072a13a9744fe997e632.svg","url":"Strong_connectivity_augmentation"}
