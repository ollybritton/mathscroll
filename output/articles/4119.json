{"title":"Digon","summary":"In geometry, a digon  is a polygon with two sides (edges) and two vertices. Its construction is degenerate in a Euclidean plane because either the two sides would coincide or one or both would have to be curved; however, it can be easily visualised in elliptic space.","image":"Digon.svg.png.webp","url":"Digon"}
