{"title":"Jean-Victor Poncelet","summary":"Jean-Victor Poncelet (French pronunciation: ​[ʒɑ̃ viktɔʁ pɔ̃slɛ]; 1 July 1788 – 22 December 1867) was a French engineer and mathematician who served most notably as the Commanding General of the École Polytechnique. He is considered a reviver of projective geometry, and his work Traité des propriétés projectives des figures is considered the first definitive text on the subject since Gérard Desargues' work on it in the 17th century. He later wrote an introduction to it: Applications d'analyse et de géométrie.[3]","image":"Jean-Victor_Poncelet.jpg.webp","url":"Jean-Victor_Poncelet"}
