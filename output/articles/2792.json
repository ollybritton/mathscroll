{"title":"Cluster-weighted modeling","summary":"In data mining, cluster-weighted modeling (CWM) is an algorithm-based approach to non-linear prediction of outputs (dependent variables) from inputs (independent variables) based on density estimation using a set of models (clusters) that are each notionally appropriate in a sub-region of the input space. The overall approach works in jointly input-output space and an initial version was proposed by Neil Gershenfeld.[1][2]","image":"1a9943640f2d05d10f8bbd826af2533757eed58f.svg","url":"Cluster-weighted_modeling"}
