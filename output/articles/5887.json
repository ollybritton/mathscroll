{"title":"Følner sequence","summary":"In mathematics, a Følner sequence for a group is a sequence of sets satisfying a particular condition.  If a group has a Følner sequence with respect to its action on itself, the group is amenable. A more general notion of Følner nets can be defined analogously, and is suited for the study of uncountable groups.  Følner sequences are named for Erling Følner.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Følner_sequence"}
