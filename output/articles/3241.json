{"title":"Connection (composite bundle)","summary":"Composite bundles Y → Σ → X {\\displaystyle Y\\to \\Sigma \\to X} play a prominent role in gauge theory with symmetry breaking, e.g., gauge gravitation theory, non-autonomous mechanics where X = R {\\displaystyle X=\\mathbb {R} } is the time axis, e.g., mechanics with time-dependent parameters, and so on. There are the important relations between connections on fiber bundles Y → X {\\displaystyle Y\\to X} , Y → Σ {\\displaystyle Y\\to \\Sigma } and Σ → X {\\displaystyle \\Sigma \\to X} .","image":"0b5235eee9c500569c12e70eb64e4fca338ce41a.svg","url":"Connection_(composite_bundle)"}
