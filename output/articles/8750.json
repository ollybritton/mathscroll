{"title":"Kleinian model","summary":"In mathematics, a Kleinian model is a model of a three-dimensional hyperbolic manifold N by the quotient space H 3 / Γ {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} ^{3}/\\Gamma } where Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } is a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,C).  Here, the subgroup Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } , a Kleinian group, is defined so that it is isomorphic to the fundamental group π 1 ( N ) {\\displaystyle \\pi _{1}(N)} of the surface N. Many authors use the terms Kleinian group and Kleinian model interchangeably, letting one stand for the other.  The concept is named after Felix Klein.","image":"8aff632025d642f387cdc0eddabeb9d52a1208c6.svg","url":"Kleinian_model"}
