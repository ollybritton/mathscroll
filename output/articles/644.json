{"title":"All horses are the same color","summary":"All horses are the same color is a falsidical paradox that arises from a flawed use of mathematical induction to prove the statement All horses are the same color.[1] There is no actual contradiction, as these arguments have a crucial flaw that makes them incorrect. This example was originally raised by George PÃ³lya in a 1954 book in different terms: \"Are any n numbers equal?\" or \"Any n girls have eyes of the same color\", as an exercise in mathematical induction.[2] It has also been restated as \"All cows have the same color\".[3]","image":"Horses_induction2.svg.png.webp","url":"All_horses_are_the_same_color"}
