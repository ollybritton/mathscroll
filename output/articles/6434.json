{"title":"Graham–Pollak theorem","summary":"In graph theory, the Graham–Pollak theorem states that the edges of an n {\\displaystyle n} -vertex complete graph cannot be partitioned into fewer than n − 1 {\\displaystyle n-1} complete bipartite graphs.[1] It was first published by Ronald Graham and Henry O. Pollak in two papers in 1971 and 1972, in connection with an application to telephone switching circuitry.[2][3]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Graham–Pollak_theorem"}
