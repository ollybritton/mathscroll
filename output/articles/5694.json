{"title":"Frederick Soddy","summary":"Frederick Soddy FRS[2] (2 September 1877 â€“ 22 September 1956) was an English radiochemist who explained, with Ernest Rutherford, that radioactivity is due to the transmutation of elements, now known to involve nuclear reactions. He also proved the existence of isotopes of certain radioactive elements.[3][4][5] In 1921 he received the Nobel Prize in  Chemistry \"for his contributions to our knowledge of the chemistry of radioactive substances, and his investigations into the origin and nature of isotopes\". Soddy was a polymath who mastered chemistry, nuclear physics, statistical mechanics, finance and economics.[6][7]","image":"Frederick_Soddy.jpg.webp","url":"Frederick_Soddy"}
