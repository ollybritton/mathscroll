{"title":"Horrocks–Mumford bundle","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the Horrocks–Mumford bundle is an indecomposable rank 2 vector bundle on 4-dimensional projective space P4 introduced by Geoffrey Horrocks and David Mumford (1973). It is the only such bundle known, although a generalized construction involving Paley graphs produces other rank 2 sheaves (Sasukara et al. 1993). The zero sets of sections of the Horrocks–Mumford bundle are abelian surfaces of degree 10, called Horrocks–Mumford surfaces.","image":"8cbb5c770c2728a235f504a42678cb1b9428489b.svg","url":"Horrocks–Mumford_bundle"}
