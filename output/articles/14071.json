{"title":"Seifert conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the Seifert conjecture states that every nonsingular, continuous vector field on the 3-sphere has a closed orbit.  It is named after Herbert Seifert.  In a 1950 paper, Seifert asked if such a vector field exists, but did not phrase non-existence as a conjecture.  He also established the conjecture for perturbations of the Hopf fibration.","image":"bd24bae0d7570018e828e19851902c09c618af91.svg","url":"Seifert_conjecture"}
