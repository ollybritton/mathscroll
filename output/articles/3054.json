{"title":"Compound of 5-cube and 5-orthoplex","summary":"In 5-dimensional geometry, the 5-cube 5-orthoplex compound[1] is a polytope compound composed of a regular 5-cube and dual regular 5-orthoplex.[2]  A compound polytope is a figure that is composed of several polytopes sharing a common center. The outer vertices of a compound can be connected to form a convex polytope called the convex hull. The compound is a facetting of the convex hull.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Compound_of_5-cube_and_5-orthoplex"}
