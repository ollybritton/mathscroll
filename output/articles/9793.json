{"title":"Lévy's constant","summary":"In mathematics Lévy's constant (sometimes known as the Khinchin–Lévy constant) occurs in an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the denominators of the convergents of continued fractions.[1] In 1935, the Soviet mathematician Aleksandr Khinchin showed[2] that the denominators qn of the convergents of the continued fraction expansions of almost all real numbers satisfy","image":"19a27e2092687dfc5067d79a56eec566a63550a9.svg","url":"Lévy's_constant"}
