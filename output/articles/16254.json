{"title":"Twist knot","summary":"In knot theory, a branch of mathematics, a twist knot is a knot obtained by repeatedly twisting a closed loop and then linking the ends together.  (That is, a twist knot is any Whitehead double of an unknot.)  The twist knots are an infinite family of knots, and are considered the simplest type of knots after the torus knots.","image":"Blue_8_1_Knot.png.webp","url":"Twist_knot"}
