{"title":"List decoding","summary":"In coding theory, list decoding is an alternative to unique decoding of error-correcting codes for large error rates. The notion was proposed by Elias in the 1950s. The main idea behind list decoding is that the decoding algorithm instead of outputting a single possible message outputs a list of possibilities one of which is correct. This allows for handling a greater number of errors than that allowed by unique decoding.","image":"e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019.svg","url":"List_decoding"}
