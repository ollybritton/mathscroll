{"title":"Connected sum","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in topology, the operation of connected sum is a geometric modification on manifolds. Its effect is to join two given manifolds together near a chosen point on each. This construction plays a key role in the classification of closed surfaces.","image":"Connected_sum.svg.png.webp","url":"Connected_sum"}
