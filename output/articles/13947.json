{"title":"Schläfli orthoscheme","summary":"In geometry, a Schläfli orthoscheme is a type of simplex. The orthoscheme is the generalization of the right triangle to simplex figures of any number of dimensions. Orthoschemes are defined by a sequence of edges ( v 0 v 1 ) , ( v 1 v 2 ) , … , ( v d − 1 v d ) {\\displaystyle (v_{0}v_{1}),(v_{1}v_{2}),\\dots ,(v_{d-1}v_{d})\\,} that are mutually orthogonal.  They were introduced by Ludwig Schläfli, who called them orthoschemes and studied their volume in Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical geometries.  H. S. M. Coxeter later named them after Schläfli. As right triangles provide the basis for trigonometry, orthoschemes form the basis of a trigonometry of n dimensions, as developed by Schoute who called it polygonometry.[1] J.-P. Sydler and Børge Jessen studied orthoschemes extensively in connection with Hilbert's third problem.","image":"91733d68124991c6561d8d6f5ca550f921c44e5e.svg","url":"Schläfli_orthoscheme"}
