{"title":"Stability (probability)","summary":"In probability theory,  the stability of a random variable is the property that a linear combination of two independent copies of the variable has the same distribution, up to location and scale  parameters.[1] The distributions of random variables having this property are said to be \"stable distributions\". Results available in probability theory show that all possible distributions having this property are members of a four-parameter family of distributions. The article on the stable distribution describes this family together with some of the properties of these distributions.","image":"59211072324157bd549fb216cbe669fddc19d9bb.svg","url":"Stability_(probability)"}
