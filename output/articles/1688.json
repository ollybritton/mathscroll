{"title":"Biquaternion","summary":"In abstract algebra, the biquaternions are the numbers  w + x i + y j + z k, where w, x, y, and z are complex numbers, or variants thereof, and the elements of {1, i, j, k} multiply as in the quaternion group and commute with their coefficients. There are three types of biquaternions corresponding to complex numbers and the variations thereof:","image":"41421172aa6699dbcb38403713316e918dc3c253.svg","url":"Biquaternion"}
