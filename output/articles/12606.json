{"title":"Projective Set (game)","summary":"Projective Set (sometimes shortened to ProSet) is a real-time card game derived from the older game Set. The deck contains cards consisting of colored dots; some cards are laid out on the table and players attempt to find \"Sets\" among them. The word projective comes from the game's relation to Projective spaces over the finite field with two elements.[1]","image":"Projective-set-deck.jpg.webp","url":"Projective_Set_(game)"}
