{"title":"Order bound dual","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, the order bound dual of an ordered vector space X {\\displaystyle X} is the set of all linear functionals on X {\\displaystyle X} that map order intervals, which are sets of the form [ a , b ] := { x ∈ X : a ≤ x and x ≤ b } , {\\displaystyle [a,b]:=\\{x\\in X:a\\leq x{\\text{ and }}x\\leq b\\},} to bounded sets.[1] The order bound dual of X {\\displaystyle X} is denoted by X b . {\\displaystyle X^{\\operatorname {b} }.} This space plays an important role in the theory of ordered topological vector spaces.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Order_bound_dual"}
