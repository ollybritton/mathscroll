{"title":"Maekawa's theorem","summary":"Maekawa's theorem is a theorem in the mathematics of paper folding named after Jun Maekawa. It relates to flat-foldable origami crease patterns and states that at every vertex, the numbers of valley and mountain folds always differ by two in either direction.[1] The same result was also discovered by Jacques Justin[2] and, even earlier, by S. Murata.[3]","image":"Kawasaki's_theorem.jpg.webp","url":"Maekawa's_theorem"}
