{"title":"Janko group","summary":"In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Janko groups are the four sporadic simple groups  J1,  J2,  J3 and  J4 introduced by Zvonimir Janko.   Unlike the Mathieu groups, Conway groups, or Fischer groups, the Janko groups do not form a series, and the relation among the four groups is mainly historical rather than mathematical.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Janko_group"}
