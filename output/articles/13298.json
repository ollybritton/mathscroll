{"title":"Regression toward the mean","summary":"In statistics, regression toward the mean (also called reversion to the mean, and reversion to mediocrity) is the phenomenon where if one sample of a random variable is extreme, the next sampling of the same random variable is likely to be closer to its mean.[1][2][3] Furthermore, when many random variables are sampled and the most extreme results are intentionally picked out, it refers to the fact that (in many cases) a second sampling of these picked-out variables will result in \"less extreme\" results, closer to the initial mean of all of the variables.","image":"Quincunx_(Galton_Box)_-_Galton_1889_diagram.png.webp","url":"Regression_toward_the_mean"}
