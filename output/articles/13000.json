{"title":"R-algebroid","summary":"In mathematics, R-algebroids are constructed starting from groupoids. These are more abstract concepts than the Lie algebroids that play a similar role in the theory of Lie groupoids to that of Lie algebras in the theory of Lie groups. (Thus, a Lie algebroid can be thought of as 'a Lie algebra with many objects ').","image":"a63e6d6ab7aa0f66f985f210429ade6fa057d184.svg","url":"R-algebroid"}
