{"title":"Expected value of sample information","summary":"In decision theory, the expected value of sample information (EVSI) is the expected increase in utility that a decision-maker could obtain from gaining access to a sample of additional observations before making a decision.  The additional information obtained from the sample may allow them to make a more informed, and thus better, decision, thus resulting in an increase in expected utility.  EVSI attempts to estimate what this improvement would be before seeing actual sample data; hence, EVSI is a form of what is known as preposterior analysis. The use of EVSI in decision theory was popularized by Robert Schlaifer and Howard Raiffa in the 1960s.[1]","image":"bb8a2028ef2c21858dda0cf83a1c2f7309813c37.svg","url":"Expected_value_of_sample_information"}
