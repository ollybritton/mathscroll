{"title":"Ford circle","summary":"In mathematics, a Ford circle is a circle in the Euclidean plane, in a family of circles that are all tangent to the x {\\displaystyle x} -axis at rational points. For each rational number p / q {\\displaystyle p/q} , expressed in lowest terms, there is a Ford circle whose center is at the point ( p / q , 1 / ( 2 q 2 ) ) {\\displaystyle (p/q,1/(2q^{2}))} and whose radius is 1 / ( 2 q 2 ) {\\displaystyle 1/(2q^{2})} . It is tangent to the x {\\displaystyle x} -axis at its bottom point, ( p / q , 0 ) {\\displaystyle (p/q,0)} . The two Ford circles for rational numbers p / q {\\displaystyle p/q} and r / s {\\displaystyle r/s} (both in lowest terms) are tangent circles when | p s âˆ’ q r | = 1 {\\displaystyle |ps-qr|=1} and otherwise these two circles are disjoint.[1]","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Ford_circle"}
