{"title":"Direct proof","summary":"In mathematics and logic, a direct proof is a way of showing the truth or falsehood of a given statement by a straightforward combination of established facts, usually axioms, existing lemmas and theorems, without making any further assumptions.[1] In order to directly prove a conditional statement of the form \"If p, then q\", it suffices to consider the situations in which the statement p is true. Logical deduction is employed to reason from assumptions to conclusion. The type of logic employed is almost invariably first-order logic, employing the quantifiers for all and there exists. Common proof rules used are modus ponens and universal instantiation.[2]","image":"d4a99135d4a7dff5d8cd7278267efb3225a1801a.svg","url":"Direct_proof"}
