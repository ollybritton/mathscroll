{"title":"Symmetry (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, an object has symmetry if there is an operation or transformation (such as translation, scaling, rotation or reflection) that maps the figure/object onto itself (i.e., the object has an invariance under the transform).[1] Thus, a symmetry can be thought of as an immunity to change.[2] For instance, a circle rotated about its center will have the same shape and size as the original circle, as all points before and after the transform would be indistinguishable. A circle is thus said to be symmetric under rotation or to have rotational symmetry. If the isometry is the reflection of a plane figure about a line, then the figure is said to have reflectional symmetry or line symmetry;[3] it is also possible for a figure/object to have more than one line of symmetry.[4]","image":"Simetria-bilateria.svg.png.webp","url":"Symmetry_(geometry)"}
