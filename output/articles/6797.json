{"title":"Hahn series","summary":"In mathematics, Hahn series (sometimes also known as Hahn–Mal'cev–Neumann series) are a type of formal infinite series. They are a generalization of Puiseux series (themselves a generalization of formal power series) and were first introduced by Hans Hahn in 1907[1] (and then further generalized by Anatoly Maltsev and Bernhard Neumann to a non-commutative setting). They allow for arbitrary exponents of the indeterminate so long as the set supporting them forms a well-ordered subset of the value group (typically Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } or R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } ). Hahn series were first introduced, as groups, in the course of the proof of the Hahn embedding theorem and then studied by him in relation to Hilbert's second problem.","image":"c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a.svg","url":"Hahn_series"}
