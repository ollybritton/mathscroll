{"title":"Milnor K-theory","summary":"In mathematics, Milnor K-theory[1] is an algebraic invariant (denoted K ∗ ( F ) {\\displaystyle K_{*}(F)} for a field F {\\displaystyle F} ) defined by John Milnor (1970) as an attempt to study higher algebraic K-theory in the special case of fields. It was hoped this would help illuminate the structure for algebraic K-theory and give some insight about its relationships with other parts of mathematics, such as Galois cohomology and the Grothendieck–Witt ring of quadratic forms. Before Milnor K-theory was defined, there existed ad-hoc definitions for K 1 {\\displaystyle K_{1}} and K 2 {\\displaystyle K_{2}} . Fortunately, it can be shown Milnor K-theory is a part of algebraic K-theory, which in general is the easiest part to compute.[2]","image":"8aa77b09c3801035b602a28c73e36e70816498fa.svg","url":"Milnor_K-theory"}
