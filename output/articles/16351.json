{"title":"Uniform antiprismatic prism","summary":"In 4-dimensional geometry, a uniform antiprismatic prism or antiduoprism is a uniform 4-polytope with two uniform antiprism cells in two parallel 3-space hyperplanes, connected by uniform prisms cells between pairs of faces. The symmetry of a p-gonal antiprismatic prism is [2p,2+,2], order 8p.","image":"CDel_node.png.webp","url":"Uniform_antiprismatic_prism"}
