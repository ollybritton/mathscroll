{"title":"Tangential polygon","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, a tangential polygon, also known as a circumscribed polygon, is a convex polygon that contains an inscribed circle (also called an incircle). This is a circle that is tangent to each of the polygon's sides. The dual polygon of a tangential polygon is a cyclic polygon, which has a circumscribed circle passing through each of its vertices.","image":"Tangential_trapezoid.svg.png.webp","url":"Tangential_polygon"}
