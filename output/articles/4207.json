{"title":"Dirichlet algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Dirichlet algebra is a particular type of algebra associated to a compact Hausdorff space X.  It is a closed subalgebra of C(X), the uniform algebra of bounded continuous functions on X, whose real parts are dense in the algebra of bounded continuous real functions on X. The concept was introduced by Andrew GleasonÂ (1957).","image":"206ee2bdf9b148adf0ffe07620839642973fb771.svg","url":"Dirichlet_algebra"}
