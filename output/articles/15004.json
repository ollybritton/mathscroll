{"title":"Steinmetz curve","summary":"A Steinmetz curve is the curve of intersection of two right circular cylinders of radii a {\\displaystyle a} and b , {\\displaystyle b,} whose axes intersect perpendicularly. In case of a = b {\\displaystyle a=b} the Steimetz curves are the edges of a Steinmetz solid. If the cylinder axes are the x- and y-axes and a â‰¤ b {\\displaystyle a\\leq b} , then the Steinmetz curves are given by the parametric equations:","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"Steinmetz_curve"}
