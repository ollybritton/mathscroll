{"title":"Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks","summary":"In mathematics and telecommunications, stochastic geometry models of wireless networks refer to mathematical models based on stochastic geometry that are designed to represent aspects of wireless networks. The related research consists of analyzing  these models with the aim of better understanding wireless communication networks in order to predict and control various network performance metrics. The models require using techniques from stochastic geometry and related fields including point processes, spatial statistics, geometric probability, percolation theory, as well as methods from more general mathematical disciplines such as geometry, probability theory, stochastic processes, queueing theory, information theory,  and Fourier analysis.[1][2][3][4]","image":"WirelessChannelTypes.jpg.webp","url":"Stochastic_geometry_models_of_wireless_networks"}
