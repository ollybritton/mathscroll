{"title":"Equiprobability","summary":"Equiprobability is a property for a collection of events that each have the same probability of occurring.[1] In statistics and probability theory it is applied in the discrete uniform distribution and the equidistribution theorem for rational numbers. If there are n {\\textstyle n} events under consideration, the probability of each occurring is 1 n . {\\textstyle {\\frac {1}{n}}.}","image":"cc6e1f880981346a604257ebcacdef24c0aca2d6.svg","url":"Equiprobability"}
