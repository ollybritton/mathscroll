{"title":"Simple function","summary":"In the mathematical field of real analysis, a simple function is a  real (or complex)-valued function over a subset of the real line, similar to a step function. Simple functions are sufficiently \"nice\" that using them makes mathematical reasoning, theory, and proof easier. For example, simple functions attain only a finite number of values. Some authors also require simple functions to be measurable; as used in practice, they invariably are.","image":"a57fe120f564b03d50ef328f6a5e09d0e860781e.svg","url":"Simple_function"}
