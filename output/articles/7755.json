{"title":"Inertial manifold","summary":"In mathematics, inertial manifolds are concerned with the long term behavior of the solutions of dissipative dynamical systems.  Inertial manifolds are finite-dimensional, smooth, invariant manifolds that contain the global attractor and attract all solutions exponentially quickly.  Since an inertial manifold is finite-dimensional even if the original system is infinite-dimensional, and because most of the dynamics for the system takes place on the inertial manifold,  studying the dynamics on an inertial manifold produces a considerable simplification in the study of the dynamics of the original system.[1]","image":"9b827c545ca1487214f0c498131228ef87718ece.svg","url":"Inertial_manifold"}
