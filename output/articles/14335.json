{"title":"Siegel–Walfisz theorem","summary":"In analytic number theory, the Siegel–Walfisz theorem was obtained by Arnold Walfisz[1] as an application of a theorem by Carl Ludwig Siegel[2] to primes in arithmetic progressions. It is a refinement both of the prime number theorem and of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions.","image":"336331f1e7d77d81d90ec2eda908c0028632e390.svg","url":"Siegel–Walfisz_theorem"}
