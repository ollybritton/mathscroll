{"title":"Möbius function","summary":"The Möbius function μ(n) is a multiplicative function in number theory introduced by the German mathematician August Ferdinand Möbius (also transliterated Moebius) in 1832.[lower-roman 1][lower-roman 2][2] It is ubiquitous in elementary and analytic number theory and most often appears as part of its namesake the Möbius inversion formula. Following work of Gian-Carlo Rota in the 1960s, generalizations of the Möbius function were introduced into combinatorics, and are similarly denoted μ(x).","image":"e688a6d05a27bcf0942463c2c78588d6a9458c86.svg","url":"Möbius_function"}
