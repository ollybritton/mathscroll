{"title":"Combinatorial Geometry in the Plane","summary":"Combinatorial Geometry in the Plane is a book in discrete geometry. It was translated from a German-language book, Kombinatorische Geometrie in der Ebene, which its authors Hugo Hadwiger and Hans Debrunner published through the University of Geneva in 1960, expanding a 1955 survey paper that Hadwiger had published in L'Enseignement mathématique.[1] Victor Klee translated it into English, and added a chapter of new material. It was published in 1964 by Holt, Rinehart and Winston,[2] and republished in 1966 by Dover Publications.[3] A Russian-language edition, Комбинаторная геометрия плоскости, translated by I. M. Jaglom and including a summary of the new material by Klee, was published by Nauka in 1965.[4] The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has recommended its inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries.[3]","image":"62f7f33480be6f5028c4275840b3bd9f48b683d1.svg","url":"Combinatorial_Geometry_in_the_Plane"}
