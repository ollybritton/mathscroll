{"title":"Complete intersection","summary":"In mathematics, an algebraic variety V in projective space is a complete intersection if the ideal of V is generated by exactly codim V elements. That is, if V has dimension m and  lies in projective space Pn, there should exist n âˆ’ m homogeneous polynomials:[1]","image":"82a8e6c2a63402e989bb264d1ad821c6f2a283c2.svg","url":"Complete_intersection"}
