{"title":"Newey–West estimator","summary":"A Newey–West estimator is used in statistics and econometrics to provide an estimate of the covariance matrix of the parameters of a regression-type model where the standard assumptions of regression analysis do not apply.[1] It was devised by Whitney K. Newey and Kenneth D. West in 1987, although there are a number of later variants.[2][3][4][5] The estimator is used to try to overcome autocorrelation (also called serial correlation), and heteroskedasticity in the error terms in the models, often for regressions applied to time series data.  The abbreviation \"HAC,\" sometimes used for the estimator, stands for \"heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent.\"[2] There are a number of HAC estimators described in,[6] and HAC estimator does not refer uniquely to Newey-West. One version of Newey-West Bartlett requires the user to specify the bandwidth and usage of the Bartlett Kernel from Kernel density estimation[6]","image":"e39b09b9895bd51f03141d3d01790bdbf07feedd.svg","url":"Newey–West_estimator"}
