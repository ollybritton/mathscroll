{"title":"Choice sequence","summary":"In intuitionistic mathematics, a choice sequence is a constructive formulation of a sequence. Since the Intuitionistic school of mathematics, as formulated by L. E. J. Brouwer, rejects the idea of a completed infinity, in order to use a sequence (which is, in classical mathematics, an infinite object), we must have a formulation of a finite, constructible object that can serve the same purpose as a sequence.  Thus, Brouwer formulated the choice sequence, which is given as a construction, rather than an abstract, infinite object.[1]","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"Choice_sequence"}
