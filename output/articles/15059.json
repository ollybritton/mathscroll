{"title":"Stickelberger's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Stickelberger's theorem is a result of algebraic number theory, which gives some information about the Galois module structure of class groups of cyclotomic fields. A special case was first proven by Ernst Kummer (1847) while the general result is due to Ludwig Stickelberger (1890).[1]","image":"c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a.svg","url":"Stickelberger's_theorem"}
