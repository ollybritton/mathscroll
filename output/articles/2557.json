{"title":"Chernoff bound","summary":"In probability theory, a Chernoff bound is an exponentially decreasing upper bound on the tail of a random variable based on its moment generating function. The minimum of all such exponential bounds forms the Chernoff or Chernoff-Cram√©r bound, which may decay faster than exponential (e.g. sub-Gaussian).[1][2] It is especially useful for sums of independent random variables, such as sums of Bernoulli random variables.[3][4]","image":"Chernoff-bound.svg.png.webp","url":"Chernoff_bound"}
