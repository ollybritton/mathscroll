{"title":"Cyclic subspace","summary":"In mathematics, in linear algebra and functional analysis, a cyclic subspace is a certain special subspace of a vector space associated with a vector in the vector space and a linear transformation of the vector space. The cyclic subspace associated with a vector v in a vector space V and a linear transformation T of V is called the  T-cyclic subspace generated by v. The concept of a cyclic subspace is a basic component in the formulation of the cyclic decomposition theorem in linear algebra.","image":"91ddb9f7cbfc6bb6431475e3b360da7953c28b32.svg","url":"Cyclic_subspace"}
