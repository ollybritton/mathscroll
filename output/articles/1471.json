{"title":"Bergman space","summary":"In complex analysis, functional analysis and operator theory, a Bergman space, named after Stefan Bergman, is a function space of holomorphic functions in a domain D of the complex plane that are sufficiently well-behaved at the boundary that they are absolutely integrable. Specifically, for 0 < p < âˆž, the Bergman space Ap(D) is the space of all holomorphic functions f {\\displaystyle f} in D for which the p-norm is finite:","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Bergman_space"}
