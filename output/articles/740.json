{"title":"Analytic capacity","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of complex analysis, the analytic capacity of a compact subset K of the complex plane is a number that denotes \"how big\" a bounded analytic function on C \\ K can become. Roughly speaking, γ(K) measures the size of the unit ball of the space of bounded analytic functions outside K.","image":"464d727d1694b6a89392d87af86a7222a430fdd4.svg","url":"Analytic_capacity"}
