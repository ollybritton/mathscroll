{"title":"First fundamental form","summary":"In differential geometry, the first fundamental form is the inner product on the tangent space of a surface in three-dimensional Euclidean space which is induced canonically from the dot product of R3.  It permits the calculation of curvature and metric properties of a surface such as length and area in a manner consistent with the ambient space.  The first fundamental form is denoted by the Roman numeral I,","image":"352daad7884614e6cd9124e2087192d5cfc55a5f.svg","url":"First_fundamental_form"}
