{"title":"Motion (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a motion is an isometry of a metric space. For instance, a plane equipped with the Euclidean distance metric is a metric space in which a mapping associating congruent figures is a motion.[1] More generally, the term motion is a synonym for surjective isometry in metric geometry,[2] including elliptic geometry and hyperbolic geometry. In the latter case, hyperbolic motions provide an approach to the subject for beginners.","image":"Glide_reflection.svg.png.webp","url":"Motion_(geometry)"}
