{"title":"Bridgeland stability condition","summary":"In mathematics, and especially algebraic geometry, a Bridgeland stability condition, defined by Tom Bridgeland, is an algebro-geometric stability condition defined on elements of a triangulated category. The case of original interest and particular importance is when this derived category is the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabiâ€“Yau manifold, and this situation has fundamental links to string theory and the study of D-branes.","image":"eed3e3db6cc2028a183af948212ed2551d25c954.svg","url":"Bridgeland_stability_condition"}
