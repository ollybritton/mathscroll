{"title":"Information processing (psychology)","summary":"Information processing is the change (processing) of information in any manner detectable by an observer.  As such, it is a  process that describes everything that happens (changes) in the universe, from the falling of a rock (a change in position) to the printing of a text file from a digital computer system. In the latter case, an information processor (the printer) is changing the form of presentation of that text file (from bytes to glyphs). The computers up to this period function on the basis of programs saved in the memory, having no intelligence of their own.","image":"Information_Processing_Model_-_Atkinson_%26_Shiffrin.jpg.webp","url":"Information_processing_(psychology)"}
