{"title":"Natural deduction","summary":"In logic and proof theory, natural deduction is a kind of proof calculus in which logical reasoning is expressed by inference rules closely related to the \"natural\" way of reasoning. This contrasts with Hilbert-style systems, which instead use axioms as much as possible to express the logical laws of deductive reasoning.","image":"e86fbe93c98e68dc66cd518c98d5f6a624f5022b.svg","url":"Natural_deduction"}
