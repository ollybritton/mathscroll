{"title":"Octonion","summary":"In mathematics, the octonions are a normed division algebra over the real numbers, a kind of hypercomplex number system. The octonions are usually represented by the capital letter O, using boldface O or blackboard bold O {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {O} } . Octonions have eight dimensions; twice the number of dimensions of the quaternions, of which they are an extension. They are noncommutative and nonassociative, but satisfy a weaker form of associativity; namely, they are alternative. They are also power associative.","image":"c1ed2664a4fe515e6fbed25a7193ce663b82920c.svg","url":"Octonion"}
