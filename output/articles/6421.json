{"title":"Gradient network","summary":"In network science, a gradient network is a directed subnetwork of an undirected \"substrate\" network where each node has an associated scalar potential and one out-link that points to the node with the smallest (or largest) potential in its neighborhood, defined as the union of itself and its neighbors on the substrate network.[1]","image":"8a6deb419f6b68e47881c89a5172e0509fe25469.svg","url":"Gradient_network"}
