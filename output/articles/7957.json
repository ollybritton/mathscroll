{"title":"Intrinsic metric","summary":"In the mathematical study of metric spaces, one can consider the arclength of paths in the space.  If two points are at a given distance from each other, it is natural to expect that one should be able to get from the first point to the second along a path whose arclength is equal to (or very close to) that distance.  The distance between two points of a metric space relative to the intrinsic metric is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all paths from the first point to the second.  A metric space is a length metric space if the intrinsic metric agrees with the original metric of the space.","image":"d78e6f2ddf5baee227ee2a9f164726ba0c23c263.svg","url":"Intrinsic_metric"}
