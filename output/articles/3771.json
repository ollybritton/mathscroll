{"title":"Darboux's theorem","summary":"Darboux's theorem is a theorem in the mathematical field of differential geometry and more specifically differential forms, partially generalizing the Frobenius integration theorem.  It is a foundational result in several fields, the chief among them being symplectic geometry.  The theorem is named after Jean Gaston Darboux[1] who established it as the solution of the Pfaff problem.[2]","image":"6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af.svg","url":"Darboux's_theorem"}
