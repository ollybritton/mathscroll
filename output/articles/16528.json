{"title":"Vector-valued Hahn–Banach theorems","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in functional analysis and Hilbert space theory, vector-valued Hahn–Banach theorems are generalizations of the Hahn–Banach theorems from linear functionals (which are always valued in the real numbers R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } or the complex numbers C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } )  to linear operators valued in topological vector spaces (TVSs).","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Vector-valued_Hahn–Banach_theorems"}
