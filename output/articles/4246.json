{"title":"Discrete Morse theory","summary":"Discrete Morse theory is a combinatorial adaptation of Morse theory developed by Robin Forman. The theory has various practical applications in diverse fields of applied mathematics and computer science, such as configuration spaces,[1] homology computation,[2][3] denoising,[4] mesh compression,[5] and topological data analysis.[6]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Discrete_Morse_theory"}
