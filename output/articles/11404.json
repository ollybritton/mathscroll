{"title":"One-dimensional space","summary":"In physics and mathematics, a sequence of n numbers can specify a location in n-dimensional space. When n = 1, the set of all such locations is called a one-dimensional space. An example of a one-dimensional space is the number line, where the position of each point on it can be described by a single number.[1]","image":"Number-line.svg.png.webp","url":"One-dimensional_space"}
