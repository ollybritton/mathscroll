{"title":"Unknot","summary":"In the mathematical theory of knots, the unknot, not knot, or trivial knot, is the least knotted of all knots.  Intuitively, the unknot is a closed loop of rope without a knot tied into it, unknotted.  To a knot theorist, an unknot is any embedded topological circle in the 3-sphere that is ambient isotopic (that is, deformable) to a geometrically round circle, the standard unknot.","image":"Blue_Unknot.png.webp","url":"Unknot"}
