{"title":"Perron–Frobenius theorem","summary":"In matrix theory, the Perron–Frobenius theorem, proved by Oskar Perron (1907) and Georg Frobenius (1912), asserts that a real square matrix with positive entries has a unique largest real eigenvalue and that the corresponding eigenvector can be chosen to have strictly positive components, and also asserts a similar statement for certain classes of nonnegative matrices. This theorem has important applications to probability theory (ergodicity of Markov chains); to the theory of dynamical systems (subshifts of finite type); to economics (Okishio's theorem,[1] Hawkins–Simon condition[2]); to demography (Leslie population age distribution model);[3] to social networks (DeGroot learning process); to  Internet search engines (PageRank);[4] and even to ranking of football teams.[5] The first to discuss the ordering of players within tournaments using Perron–Frobenius eigenvectors is Edmund Landau.[6][7]","image":"296ad42d9541f8285979ce822ccb661da56111ca.svg","url":"Perron–Frobenius_theorem"}
