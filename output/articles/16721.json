{"title":"Wall-crossing","summary":"In algebraic geometry and string theory, the phenomenon of wall-crossing describes the discontinuous change of a certain quantity, such as an integer geometric invariant, an index or a space of BPS state, across a codimension-one wall in a space of stability conditions, a so-called wall of marginal stability.","image":"Calabi_yau_formatted.svg.png.webp","url":"Wall-crossing"}
