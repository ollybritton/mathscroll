{"title":"Crossed pentagrammic cupola","summary":"In geometry, the crossed pentagrammic cupola is one of the nonconvex Johnson solid isomorphs, being topologically identical to the convex pentagonal cupola. It can be obtained as a slice of the great rhombicosidodecahedron or quasirhombicosidodecahedron. As in all cupolae, the base polygon has twice as many edges and vertices as the top; in this case the base polygon is a decagram.","image":"Crossed_pentagrammic_cupola.png.webp","url":"Crossed_pentagrammic_cupola"}
