{"title":"Quotient group","summary":"A quotient group or factor group is a mathematical group obtained by aggregating similar elements of a larger group using an equivalence relation that preserves some of the group structure (the rest of the structure is \"factored\" out).  For example, the cyclic group of addition modulo n can be obtained from the group of integers under addition by identifying elements that differ by a multiple of n {\\displaystyle n} and defining a group structure that operates on each such class (known as a congruence class) as a single entity. It is part of the mathematical field known as group theory.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Quotient_group"}
