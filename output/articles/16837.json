{"title":"Well-defined expression","summary":"In mathematics, a well-defined expression or unambiguous expression is an expression whose definition assigns it a unique interpretation or value. Otherwise, the expression is said to be not well defined, ill defined or ambiguous.[1] A function is well defined if it gives the same result when the representation of the input is changed without changing the value of the input. For instance, if f {\\displaystyle f} takes real numbers as input, and if f ( 0.5 ) {\\displaystyle f(0.5)} does not equal f ( 1 / 2 ) {\\displaystyle f(1/2)} then f {\\displaystyle f} is not well defined (and thus not a function).[2] The term well defined can also be used to indicate that a logical expression is unambiguous or uncontradictory.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Well-defined_expression"}
