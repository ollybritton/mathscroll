{"title":"Fukaya category","summary":"In symplectic topology, a Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold ( X , ω ) {\\displaystyle (X,\\omega )} is a  category F ( X ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}(X)} whose objects are Lagrangian submanifolds of X {\\displaystyle X} , and morphisms are Lagrangian Floer chain groups: H o m ( L 0 , L 1 ) = C F ( L 0 , L 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Hom} (L_{0},L_{1})=CF(L_{0},L_{1})} . Its finer structure can be described as an A∞-category.","image":"83448c52b1207c57bf64e007e1b6004262b58218.svg","url":"Fukaya_category"}
