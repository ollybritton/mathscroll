{"title":"Naimark's problem","summary":"Naimark's problem is a question in functional analysis asked by Naimark (1951). It asks whether every C*-algebra that has only one irreducible ∗ {\\displaystyle *} -representation up to unitary equivalence is isomorphic to the ∗ {\\displaystyle *} -algebra of compact operators on some (not necessarily separable) Hilbert space.","image":"8e9972f426d9e07855984f73ee195a21dbc21755.svg","url":"Naimark's_problem"}
