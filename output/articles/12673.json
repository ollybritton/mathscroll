{"title":"Propositional calculus","summary":"Propositional calculus is a branch of logic.  It is also called propositional logic, statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic. It deals with propositions (which can be true or false) and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives. Propositions that contain no logical connectives are called atomic propositions.","image":"d7cad5b2c2991ae1dbded560c5d875fbf49fe8ea.svg","url":"Propositional_calculus"}
