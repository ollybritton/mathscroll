{"title":"Block matrix pseudoinverse","summary":"In mathematics, a block matrix pseudoinverse is a formula for the pseudoinverse of a partitioned matrix. This is useful for decomposing or approximating many algorithms updating parameters in signal processing, which are based on the least squares method.","image":"bdea33211664be8c712445a69a27afebf1555320.svg","url":"Block_matrix_pseudoinverse"}
