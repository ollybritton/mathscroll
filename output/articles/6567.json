{"title":"Green's identities","summary":"In mathematics, Green's identities are a set of three identities in vector calculus relating the bulk with the boundary of a region on which differential operators act. They are named after the mathematician George Green, who discovered Green's theorem.","image":"ab63f924f31f11dc8700f6218984c05b35ef1d95.svg","url":"Green's_identities"}
