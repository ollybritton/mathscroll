{"title":"Symplectic sum","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in symplectic geometry, the symplectic sum is a geometric modification on symplectic manifolds, which glues two given manifolds into a single new one. It is a symplectic version of connected summation along a submanifold, often called a fiber sum.","image":"577d686fc81d1d1eb3ae54e78aeee8957baf6718.svg","url":"Symplectic_sum"}
