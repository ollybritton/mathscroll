{"title":"Eilenberg–Ganea theorem","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in homological algebra and algebraic topology, the Eilenberg–Ganea theorem states for every finitely generated group G with certain conditions on its cohomological dimension (namely 3 ≤ cd ⁡ ( G ) ≤ n {\\displaystyle 3\\leq \\operatorname {cd} (G)\\leq n} ), one can construct an aspherical CW complex X of dimension n whose fundamental group is G. The theorem is named after Polish mathematician Samuel Eilenberg and Romanian mathematician Tudor Ganea. The theorem was first published in a short paper in 1957 in the Annals of Mathematics.[1]","image":"aea148ccbddcf4e03fb5339a6fc4b318aee73387.svg","url":"Eilenberg–Ganea_theorem"}
