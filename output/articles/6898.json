{"title":"Harmonic conjugate","summary":"In mathematics, a real-valued function u ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle u(x,y)} defined on a connected open set Ω ⊂ R 2 {\\displaystyle \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} is said to have a conjugate (function) v ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle v(x,y)} if and only if they are respectively the real and imaginary parts of a holomorphic function f ( z ) {\\displaystyle f(z)} of the complex variable z := x + i y ∈ Ω . {\\displaystyle z:=x+iy\\in \\Omega .} That is, v {\\displaystyle v} is conjugate to u {\\displaystyle u} if f ( z ) := u ( x , y ) + i v ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle f(z):=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)} is holomorphic on Ω . {\\displaystyle \\Omega .} As a first consequence of the definition, they are both harmonic real-valued functions on Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } . Moreover, the conjugate of u , {\\displaystyle u,} if it exists, is unique up to an additive constant. Also, u {\\displaystyle u} is conjugate to v {\\displaystyle v} if and only if v {\\displaystyle v} is conjugate to − u {\\displaystyle -u} .","image":"b57461332078df873c81bca2a395fd13f78bef50.svg","url":"Harmonic_conjugate"}
