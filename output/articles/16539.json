{"title":"Vector field","summary":"In vector calculus and physics, a vector field is an assignment of a vector to each point in its domain, a subset of space, most commonly Euclidean space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} .[1]  A vector field in the plane can be visualised as a collection of arrows with a given magnitude and direction, each attached to a point in the plane. Vector fields are often used to model, for example, the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout three dimensional space, such as the wind, or the strength and direction of some force, such as the magnetic or gravitational force, as it changes from one point to another point.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Vector_field"}
