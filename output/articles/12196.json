{"title":"Planar straight-line graph","summary":"In computational geometry and geometric graph theory, a planar straight-line graph, in short PSLG, (or straight-line plane graph, or plane straight-line graph) is a term used for an embedding of a planar graph in the plane such that its edges are mapped into straight-line segments.[1] FÃ¡ry's theorem (1948) states that every planar graph has this kind of embedding.","image":"Point_location1.png.webp","url":"Planar_straight-line_graph"}
