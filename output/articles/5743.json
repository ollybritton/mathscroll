{"title":"Fresnel integral","summary":"The Fresnel integrals S(x) and C(x) are two transcendental functions named after Augustin-Jean Fresnel that are used in optics and are closely related to the error function (erf). They arise in the description of near-field Fresnel diffraction phenomena and are defined through the following integral representations:","image":"f5721ef9ddeab8142ff68250e6ad10d1dab2b6d6.svg","url":"Fresnel_integral"}
