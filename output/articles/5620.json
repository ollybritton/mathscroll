{"title":"Fourier–Mukai transform","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a Fourier–Mukai transform ΦK  is a functor between derived categories of coherent sheaves D(X) → D(Y) for schemes X and Y, which is, in a sense, an integral transform along a kernel object K ∈ D(X×Y). Most natural functors, including basic ones like pushforwards and pullbacks, are of this type.","image":"7d01edc8e3ab06386ff2e530a7a0c7bef096ddba.svg","url":"Fourier–Mukai_transform"}
