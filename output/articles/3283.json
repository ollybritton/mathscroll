{"title":"Constructible number","summary":"In geometry and algebra, a real number r {\\displaystyle r} is constructible if and only if, given a line segment of unit length, a line segment of length | r | {\\displaystyle |r|} can be constructed with compass and straightedge in a finite number of steps. Equivalently, r {\\displaystyle r} is constructible if and only if there is a closed-form expression for r {\\displaystyle r} using only integers and the operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots.","image":"0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538.svg","url":"Constructible_number"}
