{"title":"Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field","summary":"In classical field theories, the Lagrangian specification of the flow field is a way of looking at fluid motion where the observer follows an individual fluid parcel as it moves through space and time.[1][2] Plotting the position of an individual parcel through time gives the pathline of the parcel. This can be visualized as sitting in a boat and drifting down a river.","image":"1f6606810b20f4fba086816847f00a4121f6064e.svg","url":"Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_specification_of_the_flow_field"}
