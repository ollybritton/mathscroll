{"title":"Total set","summary":"In functional analysis, a total set (also called a complete set) in a vector space is a set of linear functionals T {\\displaystyle T} with the property that if a vector x ∈ X {\\displaystyle x\\in X} satisfies f ( x ) = 0 {\\displaystyle f(x)=0} for all f ∈ T , {\\displaystyle f\\in T,} then x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0} is the zero vector.[1]","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Total_set"}
