{"title":"Hamiltonian (control theory)","summary":"The Hamiltonian is a function used to solve a problem of optimal control for a dynamical system. It can be understood as an instantaneous increment of the Lagrangian expression of the problem that is to be optimized over a certain time period.[1] Inspired by, but distinct from, the Hamiltonian of classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian of optimal control theory was developed by Lev Pontryagin as part of his maximum principle.[2] Pontryagin proved that a necessary condition for solving the optimal control problem is that the control should be chosen so as to optimize the Hamiltonian.[3]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Hamiltonian_(control_theory)"}
