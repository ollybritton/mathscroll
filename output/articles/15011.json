{"title":"Stellated truncated hexahedron","summary":"In geometry, the stellated truncated hexahedron (or quasitruncated hexahedron, and stellatruncated cube[1]) is a uniform star polyhedron, indexed as U19. It has 14 faces (8 triangles and 6 octagrams), 36 edges, and 24 vertices.[2] It is represented by Schl√§fli symbol t'{4,3} or t{4/3,3}, and Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, . It is sometimes called quasitruncated hexahedron because it is related to the truncated cube, , except that the square faces become inverted into {8/3} octagrams.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Stellated_truncated_hexahedron"}
