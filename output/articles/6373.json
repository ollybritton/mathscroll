{"title":"Good cover (algebraic topology)","summary":"In mathematics, an open cover of a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} is a family of open subsets such that X {\\displaystyle X} is the union of all of the open sets. A good cover is an open cover in which all sets and all non-empty intersections of finitely-many sets are contractible (Petersen 2006).","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Good_cover_(algebraic_topology)"}
