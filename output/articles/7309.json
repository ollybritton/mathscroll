{"title":"Hitchin's equations","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular differential geometry and gauge theory, Hitchin's equations are a system of partial differential equations for a connection and Higgs field on a vector bundle or principal bundle over a Riemann surface, written down by Nigel Hitchin in 1987.[1] Hitchin's equations are locally equivalent to the harmonic map equation for a surface into the symmetric space dual to the structure group.[2] They also appear as a dimensional reduction of the self-dual Yangâ€“Mills equations from four dimensions to two dimensions, and solutions to Hitchin's equations give examples of Higgs bundles and of holomorphic connections. The existence of solutions to Hitchin's equations on a compact Riemann surface follows from the stability of the corresponding Higgs bundle or the corresponding holomorphic connection, and this is the simplest form of the Nonabelian Hodge correspondence.","image":"fae5a1e8719783bd354ea0097bcdce6b3098ca67.svg","url":"Hitchin's_equations"}
