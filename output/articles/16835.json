{"title":"Well-colored graph","summary":"In graph theory, a subfield of mathematics, a well-colored graph is an undirected graph for which greedy coloring uses the same number of colors regardless of the order in which colors are chosen for its vertices. That is, for these graphs, the chromatic number (minimum number of colors) and Grundy number (maximum number of greedily-chosen colors) are equal.[1]","image":"Complex_tripartite_graph_octahedron.svg.png.webp","url":"Well-colored_graph"}
