{"title":"Voderberg tiling","summary":"The Voderberg tiling is a mathematical spiral tiling, invented in 1936 by mathematician Heinz Voderberg (1911-1945).[1] It is a monohedral tiling: it consists of only one shape that tessellates the plane with congruent copies of itself. In this case, the prototile is an elongated irregular nonagon, or nine-sided figure. The most interesting feature of this polygon is the fact that two copies of it can fully enclose a third one. E.g., the lowest purple nonagon is enclosed by two yellow ones, all three of identical shape.[2] Before Voderberg's discovery, mathematicians had questioned whether this could be possible.","image":"Voderberg-1.png.webp","url":"Voderberg_tiling"}
