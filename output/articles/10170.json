{"title":"Matroid parity problem","summary":"In combinatorial optimization, the matroid parity problem is a problem of finding the largest independent set of paired elements in a matroid.[1] The problem was formulated by Lawler (1976) as a common generalization of graph matching and matroid intersection.[1][2] It is also known as polymatroid matching, or the matchoid problem.[3]","image":"Graphic_matroid_parity.svg.png.webp","url":"Matroid_parity_problem"}
