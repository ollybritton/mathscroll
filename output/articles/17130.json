{"title":"Zariski tangent space","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the Zariski tangent space is a construction that defines a tangent space at a point P on an algebraic variety V (and more generally). It does not use differential calculus, being based directly on abstract algebra, and in the most concrete cases just the theory of a system of linear equations.","image":"adc0e9162e96758157a34a6e44967288b481a7cd.svg","url":"Zariski_tangent_space"}
