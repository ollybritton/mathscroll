{"title":"Slow-growing hierarchy","summary":"In computability theory, computational complexity theory and proof theory, the slow-growing hierarchy is an ordinal-indexed family of slowly increasing functions gα: N → N (where N is the set of natural numbers, {0, 1, ...}). It contrasts with the fast-growing hierarchy.","image":"203713f891947e01b29e73dfbe06b0359ad6a657.svg","url":"Slow-growing_hierarchy"}
