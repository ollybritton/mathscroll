{"title":"Chord diagram (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a chord diagram consists of a cyclic order on a set of objects, together with a one-to-one pairing (perfect matching) of those objects. Chord diagrams are conventionally visualized by arranging the objects in their order around a circle, and drawing the pairs of the matching as chords of the circle.","image":"Chord_diagrams_K6_matchings.svg.png.webp","url":"Chord_diagram_(mathematics)"}
