{"title":"Sharp QT-8B","summary":"The Sharp QT-8B Micro Compet, a portable electronic desktop calculator, was the first mass-produced calculator to be battery-powered.[1] Introduced in mid-1970, it was based on its immediate predecessor, the QT-8D introduced in late 1969, but it replaced the QT-8D's integrated power supply with a rechargeable battery pack.[1] It has the same calculating integrated circuits as the QT-8D[1] and is of similar appearance and dimensions; the power supply is the only major difference.","image":"Logo_of_the_Sharp_Corporation.svg.png.webp","url":"Sharp_QT-8B"}
