{"title":"Whitehead's algorithm","summary":"Whitehead's algorithm is a mathematical algorithm in group theory for solving the automorphic equivalence problem in the finite rank free group Fn. The algorithm is based on a classic 1936 paper of J. H. C. Whitehead.[1] It is still unknown (except for the case n = 2) if Whitehead's algorithm has polynomial time complexity.","image":"15a00afaabddbe2e829b2ccce6a3f1ed31a43da6.svg","url":"Whitehead's_algorithm"}
