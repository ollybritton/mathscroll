{"title":"Cauchy surface","summary":"In the mathematical field of Lorentzian geometry, a Cauchy surface is a certain kind of submanifold of a Lorentzian manifold. In the application of Lorentzian geometry to the physics of general relativity, a Cauchy surface is usually interpreted as defining an \"instant of time\"; in the mathematics of general relativity, Cauchy surfaces are important in the formulation of the Einstein equations as an evolutionary problem.","image":"e24402fa140604df50747b5faf1e8bfefcc28b58.svg","url":"Cauchy_surface"}
