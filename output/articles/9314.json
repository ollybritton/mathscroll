{"title":"Limited principle of omniscience","summary":"In constructive mathematics, the limited principle of omniscience (LPO) and the lesser limited principle of omniscience (LLPO) are axioms that are nonconstructive but are weaker than the full law of the excluded middle (Bridges & Richman 1987). The LPO and LLPO axioms are used to gauge the amount of nonconstructivity required for an argument, as in constructive reverse mathematics. They are also related to weak counterexamples in the sense of Brouwer.","image":"693ad9f934775838bd72406b41ada4a59785d7ba.svg","url":"Limited_principle_of_omniscience"}
