{"title":"Volume form","summary":"In mathematics, a volume form or top-dimensional form is a differential form of degree equal to the differentiable manifold dimension. Thus on a manifold M {\\displaystyle M} of dimension n {\\displaystyle n} , a volume form is an n {\\displaystyle n} -form.  It is an element of the space of sections of the line bundle ⋀ n ( T ∗ M ) {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\bigwedge }^{n}(T^{*}M)} , denoted as Ω n ( M ) {\\displaystyle \\Omega ^{n}(M)} .  A manifold admits a nowhere-vanishing volume form if and only if it is orientable. An orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a density.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Volume_form"}
