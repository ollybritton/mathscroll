{"title":"Hemipolyhedron","summary":"In geometry, a hemipolyhedron is a uniform star polyhedron some of whose faces pass through its center. These \"hemi\" faces lie parallel to the faces of some other symmetrical polyhedron, and their count is half the number of faces of that other polyhedron â€“ hence the \"hemi\" prefix.[1]","image":"Tetrahemihexahedron.png.webp","url":"Hemipolyhedron"}
