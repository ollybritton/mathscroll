{"title":"Lie bialgebroid","summary":"A Lie bialgebroid is a mathematical structure in the area of non-Riemannian differential geometry. In brief a Lie bialgebroid are two compatible Lie algebroids defined on dual vector bundles.  They form the vector bundle version of a Lie bialgebra.","image":"3943eb6d1524c9f89da78227e2f8845f8ed73f6f.svg","url":"Lie_bialgebroid"}
