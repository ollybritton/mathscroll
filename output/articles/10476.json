{"title":"Mimetic interpolation","summary":"In mathematics, mimetic interpolation is a method for interpolating differential forms. In contrast to other interpolation methods, which estimate a field at a location given its values on neighboring points, mimetic interpolation estimates the field's k {\\displaystyle k} -form given the field's projection on neighboring grid elements. The grid elements can be grid points as well as cell edges or faces, depending on k = 0 , 1 , 2 , â‹¯ {\\displaystyle k=0,1,2,\\cdots } .","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Mimetic_interpolation"}
