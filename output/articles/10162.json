{"title":"Matrix splitting","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of numerical linear algebra, a  matrix splitting is an expression which represents a given matrix as a sum or difference of matrices.  Many iterative methods (for example, for systems of  differential equations) depend upon the direct solution of matrix equations involving matrices more general than tridiagonal matrices.  These matrix equations can often be solved directly and efficiently when written as a matrix splitting.  The technique was devised by Richard S. Varga in 1960.[1]","image":"df9bc8e691f6fee36d87072f35d438eef362d284.svg","url":"Matrix_splitting"}
