{"title":"Gyroelongated square cupola","summary":"In geometry, the gyroelongated square cupola is one of the Johnson solids (J23). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a square cupola (J4) by attaching an octagonal antiprism to its base. It can also be seen as a gyroelongated square bicupola (J45) with one square bicupola removed.","image":"Gyroelongated_square_cupola.png.webp","url":"Gyroelongated_square_cupola"}
