{"title":"Coherent topology","summary":"In topology, a coherent topology is a topology that is uniquely determined by a family of subspaces. Loosely speaking, a topological space is coherent with a family of subspaces if it is a topological union of those subspaces. It is also sometimes called the weak topology generated by the family of subspaces, a notion that is quite different from the notion of a weak topology generated by a set of maps.[1]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Coherent_topology"}
