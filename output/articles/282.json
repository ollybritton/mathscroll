{"title":"Absolutely convex set","summary":"In mathematics, a subset C of a real or complex vector space is said to be absolutely convex or disked if it is convex and balanced (some people use the term \"circled\" instead of \"balanced\"), in which case it is called a disk. The disked hull or the absolute convex hull of a set is the intersection of all disks containing that set.","image":"Absolute_convex_hull.svg.png.webp","url":"Absolutely_convex_set"}
