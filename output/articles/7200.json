{"title":"Higher category theory","summary":"In mathematics, higher category theory is the part of category theory at a higher order, which means that some equalities are replaced by explicit arrows in order to be able to explicitly study the structure behind those equalities. Higher category theory is often applied in algebraic topology (especially in homotopy theory), where one studies algebraic invariants of spaces, such as their fundamental weak âˆž-groupoid.","image":"Commons-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Higher_category_theory"}
