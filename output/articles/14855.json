{"title":"Square lattice","summary":"In mathematics, the square lattice is a type of lattice in a two-dimensional Euclidean space. It is the two-dimensional version of the integer lattice, denoted as Z 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} ^{2}} .[1] It is one of the five types of two-dimensional lattices as classified by their symmetry groups;[2] its symmetry group in IUC notation as p4m,[3] Coxeter notation as [4,4],[4] and orbifold notation as *442.[5]","image":"a807ab4cb3de13a66771b5a303aca31e0391e6aa.svg","url":"Square_lattice"}
