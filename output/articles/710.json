{"title":"Ambient space (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, especially in geometry and topology, an ambient space is the space surrounding a mathematical object along with the object itself.  For example, a 1-dimensional line ( l ) {\\displaystyle (l)} may be studied in isolation —in which case the ambient space of l {\\displaystyle l} is l {\\displaystyle l} , or it may be studied as an object embedded in 2-dimensional Euclidean space ( R 2 ) {\\displaystyle (\\mathbb {R} ^{2})} —in which case the ambient space of l {\\displaystyle l} is R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} , or as an object embedded in 2-dimensional hyperbolic space ( H 2 ) {\\displaystyle (\\mathbb {H} ^{2})} —in which case the ambient space of l {\\displaystyle l} is H 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} ^{2}} .  To see why this makes a difference, consider the statement \"Parallel lines never intersect.\"  This is true if the ambient space is R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} , but false if the ambient space is H 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} ^{2}} , because the geometric properties of R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} are different from the geometric properties of H 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} ^{2}} .  All spaces are subsets of their ambient space.","image":"0039d0ec175cfc7dd2fad577676dd9dc95ed3ed9.svg","url":"Ambient_space_(mathematics)"}
