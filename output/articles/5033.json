{"title":"Euclidean group","summary":"In mathematics, a Euclidean group is the group of (Euclidean) isometries of a Euclidean space E n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {E} ^{n}} ; that is, the transformations of that space that preserve the Euclidean distance between any two points (also called Euclidean transformations).  The group depends only on the dimension n of the space, and is commonly denoted E(n) or ISO(n).","image":"7e8fa8586d428ff5706c6d0a00a7939950fad89b.svg","url":"Euclidean_group"}
