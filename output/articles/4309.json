{"title":"Distortion problem","summary":"In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the distortion problem is to determine by how much one can distort the unit sphere in a given Banach space using an equivalent norm.  Specifically, a Banach space X is called Î»-distortable if there exists an equivalent norm |x| on X such that, for all infinite-dimensional subspaces Y in X,","image":"1194f3ad5524fbf8181e35cc0edd581d20a44964.svg","url":"Distortion_problem"}
