{"title":"Open and closed maps","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in topology, an open map is a function between two topological spaces that maps open sets to open sets.[1][2][3] That is, a function f : X â†’ Y {\\displaystyle f:X\\to Y} is open if for any open set U {\\displaystyle U} in X , {\\displaystyle X,} the image f ( U ) {\\displaystyle f(U)} is open in Y . {\\displaystyle Y.} Likewise, a closed map is a function that maps closed sets to closed sets.[3][4] A map may be open, closed, both, or neither;[5] in particular, an open map need not be closed and vice versa.[6]","image":"abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c.svg","url":"Open_and_closed_maps"}
