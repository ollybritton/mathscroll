{"title":"Index calculus algorithm","summary":"In computational number theory, the index calculus algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm  for computing discrete logarithms. Dedicated to the discrete logarithm in ( Z / q Z ) âˆ— {\\displaystyle (\\mathbb {Z} /q\\mathbb {Z} )^{*}} where q {\\displaystyle q} is a prime, index calculus leads to a family of algorithms adapted to finite fields and to some families of elliptic curves. The algorithm collects relations among the discrete logarithms of small primes, computes them by a linear algebra procedure and finally expresses the desired discrete logarithm with respect to the discrete logarithms of small primes.","image":"a0752dea7e1143fd2afefefa43c49735aaaf06cb.svg","url":"Index_calculus_algorithm"}
