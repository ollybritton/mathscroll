{"title":"Kantorovich theorem","summary":"The Kantorovich theorem, or Newtonâ€“Kantorovich theorem, is a mathematical statement on the semi-local convergence of Newton's method. It was first stated by Leonid Kantorovich in 1948.[1][2] It is similar to the form of the Banach fixed-point theorem, although it states existence and uniqueness of a zero rather than a fixed point.[3]","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Kantorovich_theorem"}
