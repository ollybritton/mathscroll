{"title":"Connectedness","summary":"In mathematics, connectedness[1] is used to refer to various properties meaning, in some sense, \"all one piece\". When a mathematical object has such a property, we say it is connected; otherwise it is disconnected. When a disconnected object can be split naturally into connected pieces, each piece is usually called a component (or connected component).","image":"Triangular_3_connectivity.svg.png.webp","url":"Connectedness"}
