{"title":"Weak solution","summary":"In mathematics, a weak solution (also called a generalized solution) to an ordinary or partial differential equation is a function for which the derivatives may not all exist but which is nonetheless deemed to satisfy the equation in some precisely defined sense.  There are many different definitions of weak solution, appropriate for different classes of equations.  One of the most important is based on the notion of distributions.","image":"9ef656fa72345afe28b1dd3cd7f0859f58a463d0.svg","url":"Weak_solution"}
