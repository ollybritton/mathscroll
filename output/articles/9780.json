{"title":"Luzin N property","summary":"In mathematics, a function f on the interval [a, b] has the Luzin N property, named after Nikolai Luzin (also called Luzin property or N property) if for all N ⊂ [ a , b ] {\\displaystyle N\\subset [a,b]} such that λ ( N ) = 0 {\\displaystyle \\lambda (N)=0} , there holds: λ ( f ( N ) ) = 0 {\\displaystyle \\lambda (f(N))=0} , where λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } stands for the Lebesgue measure.","image":"33194ec123afd1a8ffdd697e1464f0a3b321608a.svg","url":"Luzin_N_property"}
