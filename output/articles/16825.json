{"title":"Weil restriction","summary":"In mathematics, restriction of scalars (also known as \"Weil restriction\") is a functor which, for any finite extension of fields L/k and any algebraic variety X over L, produces another variety ResL/kX, defined over k. It is useful for reducing questions about varieties over large fields to questions about more complicated varieties over smaller fields.","image":"7f4c5f0a2db2be60dfcb8c68cfd096ddb564f87e.svg","url":"Weil_restriction"}
