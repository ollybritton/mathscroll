{"title":"Determinacy","summary":"Determinacy is a subfield of set theory, a branch of mathematics, that examines the conditions under which one or the other player of a game has a winning strategy, and the consequences of the existence of such strategies. Alternatively and similarly, \"determinacy\" is the property of a game whereby such a strategy exists. Determinacy was introduced by Gale and Stewart in 1950, under the name \"determinateness\".[1]","image":"32c7d4a93ae69b6eb771652617806fbf1a29086e.svg","url":"Determinacy"}
