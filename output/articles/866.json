{"title":"Antihomomorphism","summary":"In mathematics, an antihomomorphism is a type of function defined on sets with multiplication that reverses the order of multiplication.  An antiautomorphism is a bijective antihomomorphism, i.e. an antiisomorphism, from a set to itself. From bijectivity it follows that antiautomorphisms have inverses, and that the inverse of an antiautomorphism is also an antiautomorphism.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Antihomomorphism"}
