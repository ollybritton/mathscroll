{"title":"Kuratowski's closure-complement problem","summary":"In point-set topology, Kuratowski's closure-complement problem asks for the largest number of distinct sets obtainable by repeatedly applying the set operations of closure and complement to a given starting subset of a topological space.  The answer is 14.  This result was first published by Kazimierz Kuratowski in 1922.[1] It gained additional exposure in Kuratowski's fundamental monograph Topologie (first published in French in 1933; the first English translation appeared in 1966) before achieving fame as a textbook exercise in John L. Kelley's 1955 classic, General Topology.[2]","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Kuratowski's_closure-complement_problem"}
