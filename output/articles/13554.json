{"title":"Riemann–Hilbert correspondence","summary":"In mathematics, the term Riemann–Hilbert correspondence refers to the correspondence between regular singular flat connections on algebraic vector bundles and representations of the fundamental group, and more generally to one of several generalizations of this. The original setting appearing in Hilbert's twenty-first problem was for the Riemann sphere, where it was about the existence of systems of linear regular differential equations with prescribed monodromy representations. First the Riemann sphere may be replaced by an arbitrary Riemann surface and then, in higher dimensions, Riemann surfaces are replaced by complex manifolds of dimension > 1. There is a correspondence between certain systems of partial differential equations (linear and having very special properties for their solutions) and possible monodromies of their solutions.","image":"c0615564d8e28242d0d33fe285fe2ca7eab038d7.svg","url":"Riemann–Hilbert_correspondence"}
