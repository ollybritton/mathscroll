{"title":"Seifert–Weber space","summary":"In mathematics, Seifert–Weber space (introduced by Herbert Seifert and Constantin Weber) is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold.  It is also known as Seifert–Weber dodecahedral space and hyperbolic dodecahedral space.  It is one of the first discovered examples of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.","image":"be264aa681ecff64c5e07cd2de582194d1b20ac3.svg","url":"Seifert–Weber_space"}
