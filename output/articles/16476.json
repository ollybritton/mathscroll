{"title":"Utilitarian cake-cutting","summary":"Utilitarian cake-cutting (also called maxsum cake-cutting) is a rule for dividing a heterogeneous resource, such as a cake or a land-estate, among several partners with different cardinal utility functions, such that the sum of the utilities of the partners is as large as possible. It is a special case of the utilitarian social choice rule. Utilitarian cake-cutting is often not \"fair\"; hence, utilitarianism is often in conflict with fair cake-cutting.","image":"4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029.svg","url":"Utilitarian_cake-cutting"}
