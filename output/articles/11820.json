{"title":"Parity problem (sieve theory)","summary":"In number theory, the parity problem refers to a limitation in sieve theory that prevents sieves from giving good estimates in many kinds of prime-counting problems. The problem was identified and named by Atle Selberg in 1949. Beginning around 1996, John Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec developed some parity-sensitive sieves that make the parity problem less of an obstacle.","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"Parity_problem_(sieve_theory)"}
