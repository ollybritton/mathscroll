{"title":"Definite matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a symmetric matrix M {\\displaystyle M} with real entries is  positive-definite if the real number z T M z {\\displaystyle z^{\\textsf {T}}Mz} is positive for every nonzero real column vector z , {\\displaystyle z,} where z T {\\displaystyle z^{\\textsf {T}}} is the transpose of z {\\displaystyle z} .[1] More generally, a Hermitian matrix (that is, a complex matrix equal to its conjugate transpose)  is positive-definite if the real number z ∗ M z {\\displaystyle z^{*}Mz} is positive for every nonzero complex column vector z , {\\displaystyle z,} where z ∗ {\\displaystyle z^{*}} denotes the conjugate transpose of z . {\\displaystyle z.}","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Definite_matrix"}
