{"title":"Quadratic growth","summary":"In mathematics, a function or sequence is said to exhibit quadratic growth when its values are proportional to the square of the function argument or sequence position. \"Quadratic growth\" often means more generally \"quadratic growth in the limit\", as the argument or sequence position goes to infinity – in big Theta notation, f ( x ) = Θ ( x 2 ) {\\displaystyle f(x)=\\Theta (x^{2})} .[1] This can be defined both continuously (for a real-valued function of a real variable) or discretely (for a sequence of real numbers, i.e., real-valued function of an integer or natural number variable).","image":"50466d759f5ddf586591bbbd2560387854396543.svg","url":"Quadratic_growth"}
