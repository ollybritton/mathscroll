{"title":"Galois theory","summary":"In mathematics, Galois theory, originally introduced by Ã‰variste Galois, provides a connection between field theory and group theory. This connection, the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, allows reducing certain problems in field theory to group theory, which makes them simpler and easier to understand.","image":"Lattice_diagram_of_Q_adjoin_the_positive_square_roots_of_2_and_3%2C_its_subfields%2C_and_Galois_groups.svg.png.webp","url":"Galois_theory"}
