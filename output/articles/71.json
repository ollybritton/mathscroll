{"title":"3-torus","summary":"The three-dimensional torus, or 3-torus, is defined as any topological space that is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of three circles, T 3 = S 1 × S 1 × S 1 . {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {T} ^{3}=S^{1}\\times S^{1}\\times S^{1}.} In contrast, the usual torus is the Cartesian product of only two circles.","image":"9e9c4288d789fb62385de600057f776ef27f1d22.svg","url":"3-torus"}
