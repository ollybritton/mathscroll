{"title":"Close-packing of equal spheres","summary":"In geometry, close-packing of equal spheres is a dense arrangement of congruent spheres in an infinite, regular arrangement (or lattice). Carl Friedrich Gauss proved that the highest average density – that is, the greatest fraction of space occupied by spheres – that can be achieved by a lattice packing is","image":"a933279d99023ef275e33ebd794dd6ba51ac4b19.svg","url":"Close-packing_of_equal_spheres"}
