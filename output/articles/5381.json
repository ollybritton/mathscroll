{"title":"Fiber derivative","summary":"In the context of Lagrangian mechanics, the fiber derivative is used to convert between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian forms.  In particular, if Q {\\displaystyle Q} is the configuration manifold then the Lagrangian L {\\displaystyle L} is defined on the tangent bundle T Q {\\displaystyle TQ} and the Hamiltonian is defined on the cotangent bundle T ∗ Q {\\displaystyle T^{*}Q} —the fiber derivative is a map F L : T Q → T ∗ Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} L:TQ\\rightarrow T^{*}Q} such that","image":"8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed.svg","url":"Fiber_derivative"}
