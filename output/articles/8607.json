{"title":"Karmarkar's algorithm","summary":"Karmarkar's algorithm is an algorithm introduced by Narendra Karmarkar in 1984 for solving linear programming problems. It was the first reasonably efficient algorithm that solves these problems in polynomial time. The ellipsoid method is also polynomial time but proved to be inefficient in practice.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Karmarkar's_algorithm"}
