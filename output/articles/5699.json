{"title":"Fredholm integral equation","summary":"In mathematics, the Fredholm integral equation is an integral equation whose solution gives rise to Fredholm theory, the study of Fredholm kernels and Fredholm operators.  The integral equation was studied by Ivar Fredholm.  A useful method to solve such equations, the Adomian decomposition method, is due to George Adomian.","image":"dbba1aee3760825a222253bad7fab68e9f0437dd.svg","url":"Fredholm_integral_equation"}
