{"title":"König's theorem (complex analysis)","summary":"In complex analysis and numerical analysis, König's theorem,[1] named after the Hungarian mathematician Gyula Kőnig, gives a way to estimate simple poles or simple roots of a function. In particular, it has numerous applications in root finding algorithms like Newton's method and its generalization Householder's method.","image":"ca11780d056a19a1b907ac9a936415963b561f45.svg","url":"König's_theorem_(complex_analysis)"}
