{"title":"Artin L-function","summary":"In mathematics, an Artin L-function is a type of Dirichlet series associated to a linear representation œÅ of a Galois group G. These functions were introduced in 1923 by Emil Artin, in connection with his research into class field theory. Their fundamental properties, in particular the Artin conjecture described below,  have turned out to be resistant to easy proof. One of the aims of proposed non-abelian class field theory is to incorporate the complex-analytic nature of Artin L-functions into a larger framework, such as is provided by automorphic forms and the Langlands program. So far, only a small part of such a theory has been put on a firm basis.","image":"1f7d439671d1289b6a816e6af7a304be40608d64.svg","url":"Artin_L-function"}
