{"title":"Rogers–Ramanujan identities","summary":"In mathematics, the Rogers–Ramanujan identities are two identities related to basic hypergeometric series and integer partitions. The identities were first discovered and proved  by Leonard James Rogers (1894), and were subsequently rediscovered (without a proof) by Srinivasa Ramanujan some time before 1913. Ramanujan had no proof, but rediscovered Rogers's paper in 1917, and they then published a joint new proof (Rogers & Ramanujan 1919). Issai Schur (1917) independently rediscovered and proved the identities.","image":"ac2658451ca67fd73b1bfb9736e2f1c1cc4b3f3f.svg","url":"Rogers–Ramanujan_identities"}
