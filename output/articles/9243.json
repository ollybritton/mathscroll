{"title":"Lewis's triviality result","summary":"In the mathematical theory of probability, David Lewis's triviality result is a theorem about the impossibility of systematically equating the conditional probability P ( B ∣ A ) {\\displaystyle P(B\\mid A)} with the probability of a so-called conditional event, A → B {\\displaystyle A\\rightarrow B} .","image":"e2fe9ad0fdfd8920e56ca948400e111852af0665.svg","url":"Lewis's_triviality_result"}
