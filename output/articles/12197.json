{"title":"Plancherel theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Plancherel theorem (sometimes called the Parseval–Plancherel identity[1]) is a result in harmonic analysis, proven by Michel Plancherel in 1910. It states that the integral of a function's squared modulus is equal to the integral of the squared modulus of its frequency spectrum. That is, if f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} is a function on the real line, and f ^ ( ξ ) {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {f}}(\\xi )} is its frequency spectrum, then","image":"202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074.svg","url":"Plancherel_theorem"}
