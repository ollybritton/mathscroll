{"title":"Bounded inverse theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the bounded inverse theorem (or inverse mapping theorem) is a result in the theory of bounded linear operators on Banach spaces. It states that a bijective bounded linear operator T from one Banach space to another has bounded inverse Tâˆ’1. It is equivalent to both the open mapping theorem and the closed graph theorem.","image":"0588597845322faa8574bb51063d57575a355c19.svg","url":"Bounded_inverse_theorem"}
