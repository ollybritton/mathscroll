{"title":"L-theory","summary":"In mathematics, algebraic L-theory is the K-theory of quadratic forms; the term was coined by C. T. C. Wall, with L being used as the letter after K. Algebraic L-theory, also known as \"Hermitian K-theory\", is important in surgery theory.[1]","image":"eaa6c5ff0cb61f711a35d082ba0fc588307d7dbb.svg","url":"L-theory"}
