{"title":"Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory","summary":"In set theory, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, named after mathematicians Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel, is an axiomatic system that was proposed in the early twentieth century in order to formulate a theory of sets free of paradoxes such as Russell's paradox.  Today, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, with the historically controversial axiom of choice (AC) included, is the standard form of axiomatic set theory and as such is the most common foundation of mathematics. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice included is abbreviated ZFC, where C stands for \"choice\",[1] and ZF refers to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded.","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory"}
