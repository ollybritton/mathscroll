{"title":"Whitehead torsion","summary":"In geometric topology, a field within mathematics, the obstruction to a homotopy equivalence f : X → Y {\\displaystyle f\\colon X\\to Y} of finite CW-complexes being a simple homotopy equivalence is its Whitehead torsion τ ( f ) {\\displaystyle \\tau (f)} which is an element in the Whitehead group Wh ⁡ ( π 1 ( Y ) ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Wh} (\\pi _{1}(Y))} . These concepts are named after the mathematician J. H. C. Whitehead.","image":"07b9ff205beb51e7899846aeae788ae5e5546a3e.svg","url":"Whitehead_torsion"}
