{"title":"Proprism","summary":"In geometry of 4 dimensions or higher, a proprism is a polytope resulting from the Cartesian product of two or more polytopes, each of two dimensions or higher. The term was coined by John Horton Conway for product prism. The dimension of the space of a proprism equals the sum of the dimensions of all its product elements. Proprisms are often seen as k-face elements of uniform polytopes.[1]","image":"3-generalized-2-cube_skew.svg.png.webp","url":"Proprism"}
