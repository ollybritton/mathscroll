{"title":"Cubical complex","summary":"In mathematics, a cubical complex (also called cubical set and Cartesian complex[1]) is a set composed of points, line segments, squares, cubes, and their n-dimensional counterparts. They are used analogously to simplicial complexes and CW complexes in the computation of the homology of topological spaces.","image":"SimpleGraf.jpg.webp","url":"Cubical_complex"}
