{"title":"Discrete Chebyshev polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, discrete Chebyshev polynomials, or Gram polynomials, are a type of discrete orthogonal polynomials used in approximation theory, introduced by Pafnuty Chebyshev[1] and rediscovered by Gram.[2] They were later found to be applicable to various algebraic properties of spin angular momentum.","image":"72ccb1d3f163080c4b79d2da56a74711080750ff.svg","url":"Discrete_Chebyshev_polynomials"}
