{"title":"Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation","summary":"The Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation was historically significant and was formulated by Leslie Lawrance Foldy and Siegfried Adolf Wouthuysen in 1949 to understand the nonrelativistic limit of the Dirac equation, the equation for spin-½ particles.[1][2][3][4] A detailed general discussion of the Foldy–Wouthuysen-type transformations in particle interpretation of relativistic wave equations is in Acharya and Sudarshan (1960).[5] Its utility in high energy physics  is now limited due to the primary applications being in the ultra-relativistic domain where the Dirac field is treated as a quantised field.","image":"f6efc3d7c2cf6948737dd92740d7f987d7cf874a.svg","url":"Foldy–Wouthuysen_transformation"}
