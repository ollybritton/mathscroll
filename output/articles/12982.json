{"title":"Quiver (mathematics)","summary":"In graph theory, a quiver is a directed graph where loops and multiple arrows between two vertices are allowed, i.e. a multidigraph. They are commonly used in representation theory: a representation V of a quiver assigns a vector space V(x) to each vertex x of the quiver and a linear map V(a) to each arrow a.","image":"37fa5e6ef93e60763f3240cec06e126385c31f0b.svg","url":"Quiver_(mathematics)"}
