{"title":"Yang–Mills equations","summary":"In physics and mathematics, and especially differential geometry and gauge theory, the Yang–Mills equations are a system of partial differential equations for a connection on a vector bundle or principal bundle. They arise in physics as the Euler–Lagrange equations of the Yang–Mills action functional. They have also found significant use in mathematics.","image":"-y-(x^2%2By^2%2B1)_plot%3B_BPST_instanton.png.webp","url":"Yang–Mills_equations"}
