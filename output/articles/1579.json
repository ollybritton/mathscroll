{"title":"Biconditional elimination","summary":"Biconditional elimination is the name of two valid rules of inference of propositional logic. It allows for one to infer a conditional from a biconditional. If P ↔ Q {\\displaystyle P\\leftrightarrow Q} is true, then one may infer that P → Q {\\displaystyle P\\to Q} is true, and also that Q → P {\\displaystyle Q\\to P} is true.[1] For example, if it's true that I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive, then it's true that if I'm breathing, I'm alive; likewise, it's true that if I'm alive, I'm breathing. The rules can be stated formally as:","image":"43e9c3ed4d9717db81fc3794218f377bea4f6eb0.svg","url":"Biconditional_elimination"}
