{"title":"External (mathematics)","summary":"The term external is useful for describing certain algebraic structures. The term comes from the concept of an external binary operation which is a binary operation that draws from some external set. To be more specific, a left external binary operation on S over R is a function f : R × S → S {\\displaystyle f:R\\times S\\rightarrow S} and a right external binary operation on S over R is a function f : S × R → S {\\displaystyle f:S\\times R\\rightarrow S} where S is the set the operation is defined on, and R is the external set (the set the operation is defined over).[1]","image":"32f468aa134d5b9493e7d05d6b389133aecfdb83.svg","url":"External_(mathematics)"}
