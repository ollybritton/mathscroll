{"title":"Unary language","summary":"In computational complexity theory, a unary language or tally language is a formal language (a set of strings) where all strings have the form 1k, where \"1\" can be any fixed symbol. For example, the language {1, 111, 1111} is unary, as is the language {1k | k is prime}. The complexity class of all such languages is sometimes called TALLY.","image":"Closed_Access_logo_transparent.svg.png.webp","url":"Unary_language"}
