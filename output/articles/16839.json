{"title":"Well-founded relation","summary":"In mathematics, a binary relation R is called well-founded (or wellfounded or foundational[1]) on a class X if every non-empty subset S ⊆ X has a minimal element with respect to R, that is, an element m ∈ S not related by s R m (for instance, \"s is not smaller than m\") for any s ∈ S. In other words, a relation is well founded if","image":"39674b23f300f531f307e8dbab52b953786a5e4b.svg","url":"Well-founded_relation"}
