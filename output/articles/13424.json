{"title":"Resolution of singularities","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the problem of resolution of singularities asks whether every algebraic variety V has a resolution, a non-singular variety W with a proper birational map Wâ†’V. For varieties over fields of characteristic 0 this was proved in Hironaka (1964),[1] while for varieties over fields of characteristic p it is an open problem in dimensions at least 4.[2]","image":"Functorial_Resolution_of_Singularities.svg.png.webp","url":"Resolution_of_singularities"}
