{"title":"6-sphere coordinates","summary":"In mathematics, 6-sphere coordinates are a coordinate system for three-dimensional space obtained by inverting the 3D Cartesian coordinates across the unit 2-sphere x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1} .  They are so named because the loci where one coordinate is constant form spheres tangent to the origin from one of six sides (depending on which coordinate is held constant and whether its value is positive or negative). They have nothing whatsoever to do with the 6-sphere, which is an object of considerable interest in its own right.","image":"a5b5c3e3525a1604f9425edb80835d236fe7af82.svg","url":"6-sphere_coordinates"}
