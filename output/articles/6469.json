{"title":"Graph enumeration","summary":"In combinatorics, an area of mathematics, graph enumeration describes a class of combinatorial enumeration problems in which one must count undirected or directed graphs of certain types, typically as a function of the number of vertices of the graph.[1] These problems may be solved either exactly (as an algebraic enumeration problem) or asymptotically. The pioneers in this area of mathematics were George PÃ³lya,[2] Arthur Cayley[3] and J. Howard Redfield.[4]","image":"Cayley's_formula_2-4.svg.png.webp","url":"Graph_enumeration"}
