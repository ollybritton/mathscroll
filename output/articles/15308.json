{"title":"Surgery exact sequence","summary":"In the mathematical  surgery theory the surgery exact sequence is the main technical tool to calculate the surgery structure set of a compact manifold in dimension > 4 {\\displaystyle >4} . The surgery structure set S ( X ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {S}}(X)} of a compact n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold X {\\displaystyle X} is a pointed set which classifies n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifolds within the homotopy type of X {\\displaystyle X} .","image":"a338bdfc80fb56e273bc77f2cc4cce83d2e9bf08.svg","url":"Surgery_exact_sequence"}
