{"title":"Total operating characteristic","summary":"The total operating characteristic (TOC)  is a statistical method to compare a Boolean variable versus a rank variable. TOC can measure the ability of an index variable to diagnose either presence or absence of a characteristic. The diagnosis of presence or absence depends on whether the value of the index is above a threshold. TOC considers multiple possible thresholds. Each threshold generates a two-by-two contingency table, which contains four entries: hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections.[1]","image":"TOC_labeled.png.webp","url":"Total_operating_characteristic"}
