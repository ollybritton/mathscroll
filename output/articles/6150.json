{"title":"Geometric mean theorem","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, the right triangle altitude theorem or geometric mean theorem is a relation between the altitude on the hypotenuse in a right triangle and the two line segments it creates on the hypotenuse. It states that the geometric mean of the two segments equals the altitude.","image":"Hoehensatz2.svg.png.webp","url":"Geometric_mean_theorem"}
