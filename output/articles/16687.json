{"title":"Von Neumann neighborhood","summary":"In cellular automata, the von Neumann neighborhood (or 4-neighborhood) is classically defined on a two-dimensional square lattice and is composed of a central cell and its four adjacent cells.[1]  The neighborhood is named after John von Neumann, who used it to define the von Neumann cellular automaton and the von Neumann universal constructor within it.[2]  It is one of the two most commonly used neighborhood types for two-dimensional cellular automata, the other one being the Moore neighborhood.","image":"Von_Neumann_neighborhood.svg.png.webp","url":"Von_Neumann_neighborhood"}
