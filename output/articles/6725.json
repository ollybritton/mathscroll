{"title":"Gδ space","summary":"In mathematics, particularly topology, a Gδ space is a topological space in which closed sets are in a way ‘separated’ from their complements using only countably many open sets. A Gδ space may thus be regarded as a space satisfying a different kind of separation axiom. In fact normal Gδ spaces are referred to as perfectly normal spaces, and satisfy the strongest of separation axioms.","image":"468c749f915c3d6164d1ae27b903fc92f45e013d.svg","url":"Gδ_space"}
