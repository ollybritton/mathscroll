{"title":"Hauptvermutung","summary":"The Hauptvermutung[lower-alpha 1] of geometric topology is a now refuted conjecture asking whether any two triangulations of a triangulable space have subdivisions that are combinatorially equivalent, i.e. the subdivided triangulations are built up in the same combinatorial pattern. It was originally formulated as a conjecture in 1908 by Ernst Steinitz[1] and Heinrich Franz Friedrich Tietze,[2] but it is now known to be false.","image":"b6258592f93adb13d3b3ed0979fdb722dcad1aa7.svg","url":"Hauptvermutung"}
