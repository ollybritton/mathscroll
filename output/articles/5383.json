{"title":"Fiber product of schemes","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in algebraic geometry, the fiber product of schemes is a fundamental construction. It has many interpretations and special cases. For example, the fiber product describes how an algebraic variety over one field determines a variety over a bigger field, or the pullback of a family of varieties, or a fiber of a family of varieties. Base change is a closely related notion.","image":"Fiber_product.png.webp","url":"Fiber_product_of_schemes"}
