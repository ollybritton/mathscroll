{"title":"Klein quadric","summary":"In mathematics, the lines of a 3-dimensional projective space, S, can be viewed as points of a 5-dimensional projective space, T. In that 5-space, the points that represent each line in S lie on a quadric, Q known as the Klein quadric.","image":"590b081b67a8f7407a216e294659cc564e3a442b.svg","url":"Klein_quadric"}
