{"title":"Spectrum of a C*-algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the spectrum of a C*-algebra or dual of a C*-algebra A, denoted Â, is the set of unitary equivalence classes of  irreducible *-representations of A. A *-representation π of A on a Hilbert space H is irreducible if, and only if, there is no closed subspace K different from H and {0} which is invariant under all operators π(x) with x ∈ A. We implicitly assume that irreducible representation means non-null irreducible representation, thus excluding trivial (i.e. identically 0) representations on one-dimensional spaces. As explained below, the spectrum Â is also naturally a topological space; this is similar to the notion of the spectrum of a ring.","image":"8df8960788c6bd026486f0c31d82f9d52b4d7536.svg","url":"Spectrum_of_a_C*-algebra"}
