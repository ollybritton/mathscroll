{"title":"Davenport–Schmidt theorem","summary":"In mathematics, specifically the area of Diophantine approximation, the Davenport–Schmidt theorem tells us how well a certain kind of real number can be approximated by another kind.  Specifically it tells us that we can get a good approximation to irrational numbers that are not quadratic by using either quadratic irrationals or simply rational numbers.  It is named after Harold Davenport and Wolfgang M. Schmidt.","image":"887c9b33ab246d3510ef66be35fb097580f27c50.svg","url":"Davenport–Schmidt_theorem"}
