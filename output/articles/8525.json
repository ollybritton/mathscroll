{"title":"k-graph C*-algebra","summary":"For C*-algebra in mathematics, a k-graph (or higher-rank graph, graph of rank k) is a countable category Λ {\\displaystyle \\Lambda } with domain and codomain maps r {\\displaystyle r} and s {\\displaystyle s} , together with a functor d : Λ → N k {\\displaystyle d:\\Lambda \\to \\mathbb {N} ^{k}} which satisfies the following factorisation property: if d ( λ ) = m + n {\\displaystyle d(\\lambda )=m+n} then there are unique μ , ν ∈ Λ {\\displaystyle \\mu ,\\nu \\in \\Lambda } with d ( μ ) = m , d ( ν ) = n {\\displaystyle d(\\mu )=m,d(\\nu )=n} such that λ = μ ν {\\displaystyle \\lambda =\\mu \\nu } .","image":"0ac0a4a98a414e3480335f9ba652d12571ec6733.svg","url":"K-graph_C*-algebra"}
