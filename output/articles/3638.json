{"title":"Curl (mathematics)","summary":"In vector calculus, the curl is a vector operator that describes the infinitesimal circulation of a vector field in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The curl at a point in the field is represented by a vector whose length and direction denote the magnitude and axis of the maximum circulation.[1] The curl of a field is formally defined as the circulation density at each point of the field.","image":"Uniform_curl.svg.png.webp","url":"Curl_(mathematics)"}
