{"title":"Tangent developable","summary":"In the mathematical study of the differential geometry of surfaces, a tangent developable is a particular kind of developable surface obtained from a curve in Euclidean space as the surface swept out by the tangent lines to the curve.  Such a surface is also the envelope of the tangent planes to the curve.","image":"Helixtgtdev.png.webp","url":"Tangent_developable"}
