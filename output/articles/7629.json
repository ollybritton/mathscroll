{"title":"Identity (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, an identity is an equality relating one mathematical expression A to another mathematical expression B, such that A and B (which might contain some variables) produce the same value for all values of the variables within a certain range of validity.[1] In other words, A = B is an identity if A and B define the same functions, and an identity is an equality between functions that are differently defined. For example, ( a + b ) 2 = a 2 + 2 a b + b 2 {\\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}} and cos 2 ⁡ θ + sin 2 ⁡ θ = 1 {\\displaystyle \\cos ^{2}\\theta +\\sin ^{2}\\theta =1} are identities.[1] Identities are sometimes indicated by the triple bar symbol ≡ instead of =, the equals sign.[2] Formally, an identity is a universally quantified equality.","image":"088a0cbbeff707c1e8629fedd307923f5fe9d0e2.svg","url":"Identity_(mathematics)"}
