{"title":"L-reduction","summary":"In computer science, particularly the study of approximation algorithms, an L-reduction (\"linear reduction\") is a transformation of optimization problems which linearly preserves approximability features; it is one type of approximation-preserving reduction. L-reductions in studies of approximability of optimization problems play a similar role to that of polynomial reductions in the studies of computational complexity of decision problems.","image":"cb79d2eb846f419d78a5babdd1afcdf689febc4b.svg","url":"L-reduction"}
