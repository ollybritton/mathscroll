{"title":"Invariant differential operator","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical physics, an invariant differential operator is a kind of mathematical map from some objects to an object of similar type. These objects are typically functions on R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} , functions on a manifold, vector valued functions, vector fields, or, more generally, sections of a vector bundle.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Invariant_differential_operator"}
