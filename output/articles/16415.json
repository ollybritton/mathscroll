{"title":"Unitary operator","summary":"In functional analysis, a unitary operator is a surjective bounded operator on a Hilbert space that preserves the inner product. Unitary operators are usually taken as operating on a Hilbert space, but the same notion serves to define the concept of isomorphism between Hilbert spaces.","image":"d44322777c4d280bf535872bbc558b6847441919.svg","url":"Unitary_operator"}
