{"title":"Sequentially complete","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in topology and functional analysis, a subspace S of a uniform space X is said to be sequentially complete or semi-complete if every Cauchy sequence in S converges to an element in S. X is called sequentially complete if it is a sequentially complete subset of itself.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Sequentially_complete"}
