{"title":"Hexagonal tiling-triangular tiling honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the hexagonal tiling-triangular tiling honeycomb is a paracompact uniform honeycomb, constructed from triangular tiling, hexagonal tiling, and trihexagonal tiling cells, in a rhombitrihexagonal tiling vertex figure. It has a single-ring Coxeter diagram, , and is named by its two regular cells.","image":"CDel_label6.png.webp","url":"Hexagonal_tiling-triangular_tiling_honeycomb"}
