{"title":"Stark–Heegner theorem","summary":"In number theory, the Baker–Heegner–Stark theorem[1] establishes the complete list of the quadratic imaginary number fields whose rings of integers are unique factorization domains. It solves a special case of Gauss's class number problem of determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields that have a given fixed class number.","image":"0cbe28d4abe306edec1f32eaa85c57afded3cd37.svg","url":"Stark–Heegner_theorem"}
