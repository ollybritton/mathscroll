{"title":"Gradient discretisation method","summary":"In numerical mathematics, the gradient discretisation method (GDM) is a framework which contains classical and recent numerical schemes for diffusion problems of various kinds: linear or non-linear, steady-state or time-dependent.  The schemes may be conforming or non-conforming, and may rely on very general polygonal or polyhedral meshes (or may even be meshless).","image":"Plaplacien4.svg.png.webp","url":"Gradient_discretisation_method"}
