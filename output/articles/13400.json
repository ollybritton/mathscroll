{"title":"Representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras","summary":"In mathematics, the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras is one of the crowning achievements of the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. The theory was worked out mainly by E. Cartan and H. Weyl and because of that, the theory is also known as the Cartanâ€“Weyl theory.[1] The theory gives the structural description and classification of a finite-dimensional representation of a semisimple Lie algebra (over C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } ); in particular, it gives a way to parametrize (or classify) irreducible finite-dimensional representations of a semisimple Lie algebra, the result known as the theorem of the highest weight.","image":"f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7.svg","url":"Representation_theory_of_semisimple_Lie_algebras"}
