{"title":"Composite Bézier curve","summary":"In geometric modelling and in computer graphics, a composite Bézier curve or Bézier spline is a spline made out of Bézier curves that is at least C 0 {\\displaystyle C^{0}} continuous. In other words, a composite Bézier curve is a series of Bézier curves joined end to end where the last point of one curve coincides with the starting point of the next curve. Depending on the application, additional smoothness requirements (such as C 1 {\\displaystyle C^{1}} or C 2 {\\displaystyle C^{2}} continuity) may be added.[1]","image":"7c14274cad45f7c22b662e7a4e56b1db052883d1.svg","url":"Composite_Bézier_curve"}
