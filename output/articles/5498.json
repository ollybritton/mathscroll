{"title":"Five-dimensional space","summary":"A five-dimensional space is a space with five dimensions. In mathematics, a sequence of N numbers can represent a location in an N-dimensional space. If interpreted physically, that is one more than the usual three spatial dimensions and the fourth dimension of time used in relativistic physics.[1] Whether or not the universe is five-dimensional is a topic of debate.","image":"5-cube_t0.svg.png.webp","url":"Five-dimensional_space"}
