{"title":"Schönhardt polyhedron","summary":"In geometry, the Schönhardt polyhedron is the simplest non-convex polyhedron that cannot be triangulated into tetrahedra without adding new vertices. It is named after German mathematician Erich Schönhardt, who described it in 1928.[1] The same polyhedra have also been studied in connection with Cauchy's rigidity theorem as an example where polyhedra with two different shapes have faces of the same shapes.","image":"Schönhardt_polyhedron.svg.png.webp","url":"Schönhardt_polyhedron"}
