{"title":"Galois connection","summary":"In mathematics, especially in order theory, a Galois connection is a particular correspondence (typically) between two partially ordered sets (posets).  Galois connections find applications in various mathematical theories. They generalize the fundamental theorem of Galois theory about the correspondence between subgroups and subfields, discovered by the French mathematician Ã‰variste Galois.","image":"9c5d0b666a10497100a6fb0a737ce630a2adc420.svg","url":"Galois_connection"}
