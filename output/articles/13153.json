{"title":"Rational set","summary":"In computer science, more precisely in automata theory, a rational set of a monoid is an element of the minimal class of subsets of this monoid that contains all finite subsets and is closed under union, product and Kleene star. Rational sets are useful in automata theory, formal languages and algebra.","image":"13bab949c133208a6ced672bdaaaae1756cfd899.svg","url":"Rational_set"}
