{"title":"Congruence subgroup","summary":"In mathematics, a congruence subgroup of a matrix group with integer entries is a subgroup defined by congruence conditions on the entries. A very simple example would be invertible 2 × 2 integer matrices of determinant 1, in which the off-diagonal entries are even. More generally, the notion of congruence subgroup can be defined for arithmetic subgroups of algebraic groups; that is, those for which we have a notion of 'integral structure' and can define reduction maps modulo an integer.","image":"ca2d95ba975aa85bd6c46f0a696872d3aa385869.svg","url":"Congruence_subgroup"}
