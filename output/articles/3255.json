{"title":"Conservative system","summary":"In mathematics, a conservative system is a dynamical system which stands in contrast to a dissipative system. Roughly speaking, such systems have no friction or other mechanism to dissipate the dynamics, and thus, their phase space does not shrink over time. Precisely speaking, they are those dynamical systems that have a null wandering set: under time evolution, no portion of the phase space ever \"wanders away\", never to be returned to or revisited. Alternately, conservative systems are those to which the  Poincar√© recurrence theorem applies. An important special case of conservative systems are the measure-preserving dynamical systems.","image":"281fdbc63924c5875baf99bb182c27223e230e76.svg","url":"Conservative_system"}
