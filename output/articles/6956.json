{"title":"Hausdorff gap","summary":"In mathematics, a Hausdorff gap consists roughly of two collections of sequences of integers, such that there is no sequence lying between the two collections. The first example was found by HausdorffÂ (1909). The existence of Hausdorff gaps shows that the partially ordered set of possible growth rates of sequences is not complete.","image":"9aa5636cabcea62c44c8b91fd9095e06054a6fa4.svg","url":"Hausdorff_gap"}
