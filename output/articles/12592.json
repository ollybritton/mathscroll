{"title":"Projected dynamical system","summary":"Projected dynamical systems is a mathematical theory investigating the behaviour of dynamical systems where solutions are restricted to a constraint set. The discipline shares connections to and applications with both the static world of optimization and equilibrium problems and the dynamical world of ordinary differential equations. A projected dynamical system is given by the flow to the projected differential equation","image":"35c7ecbd1ef06c198d0de0d5bd97da31e2a6be6f.svg","url":"Projected_dynamical_system"}
