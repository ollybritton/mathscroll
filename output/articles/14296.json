{"title":"Shifting nth root algorithm","summary":"The shifting nth root algorithm is an algorithm for extracting the nth root of a positive real number which proceeds iteratively by shifting in n digits of the radicand, starting with the most significant, and produces one digit of the root on each iteration, in a manner similar to long division.","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Shifting_nth_root_algorithm"}
