{"title":"Divisor (algebraic geometry)","summary":"In algebraic geometry, divisors are a generalization of codimension-1 subvarieties of algebraic varieties. Two different generalizations are in common use, Cartier divisors and Weil divisors (named for Pierre Cartier and Andr√© Weil by David Mumford). Both are derived from the notion of divisibility in the integers and algebraic number fields.","image":"8c94a4ed8e904c62004e8d75f56ca724e9c9fa9b.svg","url":"Divisor_(algebraic_geometry)"}
