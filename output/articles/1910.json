{"title":"Box topology","summary":"In topology, the cartesian product of topological spaces can be given several different topologies. One of the more natural choices is the box topology, where a base is given by the Cartesian products of open sets in the component spaces.[1] Another possibility is the product topology, where a base is given by the Cartesian products of open sets in the component spaces, only finitely many of which can be not equal to the entire component space.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Box_topology"}
