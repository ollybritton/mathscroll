{"title":"Peter Orno","summary":"Beginning in 1974, the fictitious Peter Orno (alternatively, Peter Ørno, P. Ørno, and P. Orno) appeared as the author of research papers in mathematics. According to Robert Phelps,[1] the name \"P. Orno\" is a pseudonym that was inspired by \"porno\", an abbreviation for \"pornography\".[2][3] Orno's short papers have been called \"elegant\" contributions to functional analysis. Orno's theorem on linear operators is important in the theory of Banach spaces. Research mathematicians have written acknowledgments that have thanked Orno for stimulating discussions and for Orno's generosity in allowing others to publish his results. The Mathematical Association of America's journals have also published more than a dozen problems whose solutions were submitted in the name of Orno.","image":"OSU_Numbers_Garden.JPG.webp","url":"Peter_Orno"}
