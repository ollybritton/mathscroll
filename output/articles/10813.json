{"title":"Multiplication theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the multiplication theorem is a certain type of identity obeyed by many special functions related to the gamma function. For the explicit case of the gamma function, the identity is a product of values; thus the name. The various relations all stem from the same underlying principle; that is, the relation for one special function can be derived from that for the others, and is simply a manifestation of the same identity in different guises.","image":"a53ff89a741c305596d1a6bbb29f829efe7cc857.svg","url":"Multiplication_theorem"}
