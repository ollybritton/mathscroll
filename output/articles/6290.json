{"title":"Gittins index","summary":"The Gittins index is a measure of the reward that can be achieved through a given stochastic process with certain properties, namely: the process has an ultimate termination state and evolves with an option, at each intermediate state, of terminating. Upon terminating at a given state, the reward achieved is the sum of the probabilistic expected rewards associated with every state from the actual terminating state to the ultimate terminal state, inclusive. The index is a real scalar.","image":"507ab5908f554d441b5cbdc3f172c59cb28ca2ff.svg","url":"Gittins_index"}
