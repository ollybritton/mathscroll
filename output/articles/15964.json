{"title":"Transformation (function)","summary":"In mathematics, a transformation is a function f, usually with some geometrical underpinning, that maps a set X to itself, i.e. f : X → X.[1][2][3] Examples include linear transformations of vector spaces and geometric transformations, which include projective transformations, affine transformations, and specific affine transformations, such as rotations, reflections and translations.[4][5]","image":"A_code_snippet_for_a_rhombic_repetitive_pattern.svg.png.webp","url":"Transformation_(function)"}
