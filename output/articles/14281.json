{"title":"Shell integration","summary":"Shell integration (the shell method in integral calculus) is a method for calculating the volume of a solid of revolution, when integrating along an axis perpendicular to the axis of revolution. This is in contrast to disc integration which integrates along the axis parallel to the axis of revolution.","image":"Shell_integral_undergraph_-_around_y-axis.png.webp","url":"Shell_integration"}
