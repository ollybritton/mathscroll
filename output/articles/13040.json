{"title":"Radius of convergence","summary":"In mathematics, the radius of convergence of a power series is the radius of the largest disk at the center of the series in which the series converges.  It is either a non-negative real number or âˆž {\\displaystyle \\infty } .  When it is positive, the power series converges absolutely and uniformly on compact sets inside the open disk of radius equal to the radius of convergence, and it is the Taylor series of the analytic function to which it converges. In case of multiple singularities of a function (singularities are those values of the argument for which the function is not defined), the radius of convergence is the shortest or minimum of all the respective distances (which are all non-negative numbers) calculated from the center of the disk of convergence to the respective singularities of the function.","image":"c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21.svg","url":"Radius_of_convergence"}
