{"title":"Orthobifastigium","summary":"In geometry,  the orthobifastigium (digonal orthobicupola), is formed by gluing together two triangular prisms on their square faces, but without twisting. With regular faces, it has coplanar faces, so it is a limiting case of a Johnson solid. More generally the square can be isosceles trapezoids.","image":"4-diminished_icosahedron.png.webp","url":"Orthobifastigium"}
