{"title":"Skorokhod's representation theorem","summary":"In mathematics and statistics, Skorokhod's representation theorem is a result that shows that a weakly convergent sequence of probability measures whose limit measure is sufficiently well-behaved can be represented as the distribution/law of a pointwise convergent sequence of random variables defined on a common probability space. It is named for the Soviet mathematician A. V. Skorokhod.","image":"7bc9252c111eb11e19f8bc66d61e5a68ba5217ab.svg","url":"Skorokhod's_representation_theorem"}
