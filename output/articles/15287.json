{"title":"Supersingular prime (moonshine theory)","summary":"In the mathematical branch of moonshine theory, a supersingular prime is a prime number that divides the order of the Monster group M, which is the largest sporadic simple group.  There are precisely fifteen supersingular prime numbers: the first eleven primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31), as well as 41, 47, 59, and 71.
