{"title":"Truth table","summary":"A truth table is a mathematical table used in logic—specifically in connection with Boolean algebra, boolean functions, and propositional calculus—which sets out the functional values of logical expressions on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical variables.[1] In particular, truth tables can be used to show whether a propositional expression is true for all legitimate input values, that is, logically valid.","image":"7694c9fc8eebe8a57c8156dd3c2caf022a619439.svg","url":"Truth_table"}
