{"title":"Tangent bundle","summary":"In differential geometry, the tangent bundle of a differentiable manifold M {\\displaystyle M} is a manifold T M {\\displaystyle TM} which assembles all the tangent vectors in M {\\displaystyle M} . As a set, it is given by the disjoint union[note 1] of the tangent spaces of M {\\displaystyle M} .  That is,","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Tangent_bundle"}
