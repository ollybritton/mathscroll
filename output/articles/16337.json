{"title":"Unibranch local ring","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a local ring A is said to be unibranch if the reduced ring Ared (obtained by quotienting A by its nilradical) is an integral domain, and the integral closure B of Ared is also a local ring. A unibranch local ring is said to be geometrically unibranch if the residue field of B is a purely inseparable extension of the residue field of Ared. A complex variety X is called topologically unibranch at a point x if for all complements Y of closed algebraic subsets of X there is a fundamental system of neighborhoods (in the classical topology) of x whose intersection with Y is connected.","image":"07b9ff205beb51e7899846aeae788ae5e5546a3e.svg","url":"Unibranch_local_ring"}
