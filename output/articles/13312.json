{"title":"Regular graph","summary":"In graph theory, a regular graph is a graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors; i.e. every vertex has the same degree or valency. A regular directed graph must also satisfy the stronger condition that the indegree and outdegree of each internal vertex are equal to each other.[1] A regular graph with vertices of degree k is called a kâ€‘regular graph or regular graph of degree k. Also, from the handshaking lemma, a regular graph contains an even number of vertices with odd degree.","image":"0-regular_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Regular_graph"}
