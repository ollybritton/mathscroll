{"title":"Chevalley basis","summary":"In mathematics, a Chevalley basis for a simple complex Lie algebra is a basis constructed by Claude Chevalley with the property that all structure constants are integers. Chevalley used these bases to construct analogues of Lie groups over finite fields, called Chevalley groups.  The Chevalley basis is the Cartan-Weyl basis, but with a different normalization.","image":"69a71f6c9e544e93bbf659f1597e724c8dd8405b.svg","url":"Chevalley_basis"}
