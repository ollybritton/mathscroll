{"title":"Fourier operator","summary":"The Fourier operator is the kernel of the Fredholm integral of the first kind that defines the continuous Fourier transform, and is a two-dimensional function when it corresponds to the Fourier transform of one-dimensional functions. It is complex-valued and has a constant (typically unity) magnitude everywhere.  When depicted, e.g. for teaching purposes, it may be visualized by its separate real and imaginary parts, or as a colour image using a colour wheel to denote phase.[1][2]","image":"Fourieropr.png.webp","url":"Fourier_operator"}
