{"title":"Local regression","summary":"Local regression or local polynomial regression,[1] also known as moving regression,[2] is a generalization of the moving average and polynomial regression.[3] Its most common methods, initially developed for scatterplot smoothing, are LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) and LOWESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing), both pronounced /ˈloʊɛs/. They are two strongly related non-parametric regression methods that combine multiple regression models in a k-nearest-neighbor-based meta-model. In some fields, LOESS is known and commonly referred to as Savitzky–Golay filter[4][5] (proposed 15 years before LOESS).","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Local_regression"}
