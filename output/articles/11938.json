{"title":"Pell's equation","summary":"Pell's equation, also called the Pell–Fermat equation, is any Diophantine equation of the form x 2 − n y 2 = 1 , {\\displaystyle x^{2}-ny^{2}=1,} where n is a given positive nonsquare integer, and integer solutions are sought for x and y. In Cartesian coordinates, the equation is represented by a hyperbola; solutions occur wherever the curve passes through a point whose x and y coordinates are both integers, such as the trivial solution with x = 1 and y = 0. Joseph Louis Lagrange proved that, as long as n is not a perfect square, Pell's equation has infinitely many distinct integer solutions. These solutions may be used to accurately approximate the square root of n by rational numbers of the form x/y.","image":"879365ec46ff5a6685f05f0c03d95f1f4bc8827c.svg","url":"Pell's_equation"}
