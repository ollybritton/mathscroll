{"title":"Arithmetic mean","summary":"In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean ( /ˌærɪθˈmɛtɪk ˈmiːn/ arr-ith-MET-ik), arithmetic average, or just the mean or average (when the context is clear), is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.[1] The collection is often a set of results from an experiment, an observational study, or a survey. The term \"arithmetic mean\" is preferred in some mathematics and statistics contexts because it helps distinguish it from other types of means, such as geometric and harmonic.","image":"c09e28c409c45c4ee539208dc40e404f3c111724.svg","url":"Arithmetic_mean"}
