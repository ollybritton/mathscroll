{"title":"Uncountable set","summary":"In mathematics, an uncountable set (or uncountably infinite set)[1] is an infinite set that contains too many elements to be countable. The uncountability of a set is closely related to its cardinal number: a set is uncountable if its cardinal number is larger than that of the set of all natural numbers.","image":"721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1.svg","url":"Uncountable_set"}
