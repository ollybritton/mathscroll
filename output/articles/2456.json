{"title":"Chain (algebraic topology)","summary":"In algebraic topology, a k-chain is a formal linear combination of the k-cells in a cell complex. In simplicial complexes (respectively, cubical complexes), k-chains are combinations of k-simplices (respectively, k-cubes),[1][2][3] but not necessarily connected. Chains are used in homology; the elements of a homology group are equivalence classes of chains.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Chain_(algebraic_topology)"}
