{"title":"Wigner quasiprobability distribution","summary":"The Wigner quasiprobability distribution (also called the Wigner function or the Wigner–Ville distribution, after Eugene Wigner and Jean-André Ville) is a quasiprobability distribution. It was introduced by Eugene Wigner in 1932[1] to study quantum corrections to classical statistical mechanics. The goal was to link the wavefunction that appears in Schrödinger's equation to a probability distribution in phase space.","image":"Wignerfunction_catstate_even_2.0.png.webp","url":"Wigner_quasiprobability_distribution"}
