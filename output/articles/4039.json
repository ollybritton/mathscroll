{"title":"Diagonal lemma","summary":"In mathematical logic, the diagonal lemma  (also known as diagonalization lemma, self-reference lemma[1] or fixed point theorem) establishes the existence of self-referential sentences in certain formal theories of the natural numbers—specifically those theories that are strong enough to represent all computable functions. The sentences whose existence is secured by the diagonal lemma can then, in turn, be used to prove fundamental limitative results such as  Gödel's incompleteness theorems and Tarski's undefinability theorem.[2]","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"Diagonal_lemma"}
