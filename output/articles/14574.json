{"title":"Smith–Minkowski–Siegel mass formula","summary":"In mathematics, the Smith–Minkowski–Siegel mass formula (or Minkowski–Siegel mass formula) is a formula for the sum of the weights of the lattices (quadratic forms) in a genus, weighted by the reciprocals of the orders of their automorphism groups. The mass formula is often given for integral quadratic forms, though it can be generalized to quadratic forms over any algebraic number field.","image":"ffcde48b8e7ce402214e4bc0a3776208608bab4e.svg","url":"Smith–Minkowski–Siegel_mass_formula"}
