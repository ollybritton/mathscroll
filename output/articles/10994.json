{"title":"Neighbourhood (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, an adjacent vertex of a vertex v in a graph is a vertex that is connected to v by an edge. The neighbourhood of a vertex v in a graph G is the subgraph of G  induced by all vertices adjacent to v, i.e., the graph composed of the vertices adjacent to v and all edges connecting vertices adjacent to v.","image":"6n-graf.svg.png.webp","url":"Neighbourhood_(graph_theory)"}
