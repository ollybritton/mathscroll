{"title":"Matrix calculus","summary":"In mathematics, matrix calculus is a specialized notation for doing multivariable calculus, especially over spaces of matrices.  It collects the various partial derivatives of a single function with respect to many variables, and/or of a multivariate function with respect to a single variable, into vectors and matrices that can be treated as single entities.  This greatly simplifies operations such as finding the maximum or minimum of a multivariate function and solving systems of differential equations. The notation used here is commonly used in statistics and engineering, while the tensor index notation is preferred in physics.","image":"7940f5f72123cd1db44888f39bcb6c8453a21d90.svg","url":"Matrix_calculus"}
