{"title":"Artin's conjecture on primitive roots","summary":"In number theory, Artin's conjecture on primitive roots states that a given integer a that is neither a square number nor âˆ’1 is a primitive root modulo infinitely many primes p. The conjecture also ascribes an asymptotic density to these primes. This conjectural density equals Artin's constant or a rational multiple thereof.","image":"5421efad12728c0b0b76bac7b93c8cf554791aa7.svg","url":"Artin's_conjecture_on_primitive_roots"}
