{"title":"Boolean prime ideal theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Boolean prime ideal theorem states that ideals in a Boolean algebra can be extended to  prime ideals. A variation of this statement for filters on sets is known as the ultrafilter lemma. Other theorems are obtained by considering different mathematical structures with appropriate notions of ideals, for example, rings and prime ideals (of ring theory), or distributive lattices and maximal ideals (of order theory). This article focuses on prime ideal theorems from order theory.","image":"3378f65d191a92b42edb1020f8fede1ce40a7d2d.svg","url":"Boolean_prime_ideal_theorem"}
