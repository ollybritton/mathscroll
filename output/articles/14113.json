{"title":"Semi-s-cobordism","summary":"In mathematics, a cobordism (W, M, M−) of an (n + 1)-dimensional manifold (with boundary) W between its boundary components, two n-manifolds M and M−, is called a semi-s-cobordism if (and only if) the inclusion M ↪ W {\\displaystyle M\\hookrightarrow W} is a simple homotopy equivalence (as in an s-cobordism), with no further requirement on the inclusion M − ↪ W {\\displaystyle M^{-}\\hookrightarrow W} (not even being a homotopy equivalence).","image":"7ec5967267672aecbe7d39d81b19a886ea870c11.svg","url":"Semi-s-cobordism"}
