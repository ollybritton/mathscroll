{"title":"Cuboctahedron","summary":"A cuboctahedron is a polyhedron with 8 triangular faces and 6 square faces. A cuboctahedron has 12 identical vertices, with 2 triangles and 2 squares meeting at each, and 24 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a square. As such, it is a quasiregular polyhedron, i.e. an Archimedean solid that is not only vertex-transitive but also edge-transitive.[1] It is radially equilateral.","image":"Cuboctahedron.jpg.webp","url":"Cuboctahedron"}
