{"title":"Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method","summary":"In mathematics, the Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method (or Fehlberg method) is an algorithm in numerical analysis for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. It was developed by the German mathematician Erwin Fehlberg and is based on the large class of Runge–Kutta methods.","image":"Periodic_3-body_RKF_Integration.gif","url":"Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg_method"}
