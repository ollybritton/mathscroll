{"title":"Graphon","summary":"In graph theory and statistics, a graphon (also known as a graph limit) is a symmetric measurable function W : [ 0 , 1 ] 2 â†’ [ 0 , 1 ] {\\displaystyle W:[0,1]^{2}\\to [0,1]} , that is important in the study of dense graphs. Graphons arise both as a natural notion for the limit of a sequence of dense graphs, and as the fundamental defining objects of exchangeable random graph models. Graphons are tied to dense graphs by the following pair of observations: the random graph models defined by graphons give rise to dense graphs almost surely, and, by the regularity lemma, graphons capture the structure of arbitrary large dense graphs.","image":"ed1d68dec2c8a2552affdd7869423b1185846c34.svg","url":"Graphon"}
