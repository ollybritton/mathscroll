{"title":"Lucky number","summary":"In number theory, a lucky number is a natural number in a set which is generated by a certain \"sieve\". This sieve is similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes that generates the primes, but it eliminates numbers based on their position in the remaining set, instead of their value (or position in the initial set of natural numbers).[1]","image":"LuckySieve.gif","url":"Lucky_number"}
