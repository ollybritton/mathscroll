{"title":"Constant-Q transform","summary":"In mathematics and signal processing, the constant-Q transform and variable-Q transform, simply known as CQT and VQT, transforms a data series to the frequency domain. It is related to the Fourier transform[1] and very closely related to the complex Morlet wavelet transform.[2] Its design is suited for musical representation.","image":"CQT-piano-chord.png.webp","url":"Constant-Q_transform"}
