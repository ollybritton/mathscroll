{"title":"Geodesic polyhedron","summary":"A geodesic polyhedron is a convex polyhedron made from triangles. They usually have icosahedral symmetry, such that they have 6 triangles at a vertex, except 12 vertices which have 5 triangles. They are the dual of corresponding Goldberg polyhedra with mostly hexagonal faces.","image":"Geodesic_icosahedral_polyhedron_example.png.webp","url":"Geodesic_polyhedron"}
