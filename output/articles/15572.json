{"title":"Tensor product of Hilbert spaces","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular functional analysis, the tensor product of Hilbert spaces is a way to extend the tensor product construction so that the result of taking a tensor product of two Hilbert spaces is another Hilbert space. Roughly speaking, the tensor product is the metric space completion of the ordinary tensor product. This is an example of a topological tensor product. The tensor product allows Hilbert spaces to be collected into a symmetric monoidal category.[1]","image":"4d4d9a872a55b209f2eb7cc23a71e5e1541bd1f4.svg","url":"Tensor_product_of_Hilbert_spaces"}
