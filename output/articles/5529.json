{"title":"Floer homology","summary":"In mathematics, Floer homology is a tool for studying symplectic geometry and low-dimensional topology.  Floer homology is a novel invariant that arises as an infinite-dimensional analogue of finite-dimensional Morse homology.  Andreas Floer introduced the first version of Floer homology, now called Lagrangian Floer homology, in his proof of the Arnold conjecture in symplectic geometry.  Floer also developed a closely related theory for Lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold. A third construction, also due to Floer, associates homology groups to closed three-dimensional manifolds using the Yangâ€“Mills functional.  These constructions and their descendants play a fundamental role in current investigations into the topology of symplectic and contact manifolds as well as (smooth) three- and four-dimensional manifolds.","image":"a49773a35ec00315c49bc758ca60ea2f170f61ad.svg","url":"Floer_homology"}
