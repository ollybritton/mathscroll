{"title":"Normal subgroup","summary":"In abstract algebra, a normal subgroup (also known as an invariant subgroup or self-conjugate subgroup)[1] is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by members of the group of which it is a part. In other words, a subgroup N {\\displaystyle N} of the group G {\\displaystyle G} is normal in G {\\displaystyle G} if and only if g n g − 1 ∈ N {\\displaystyle gng^{-1}\\in N} for all g ∈ G {\\displaystyle g\\in G} and n ∈ N . {\\displaystyle n\\in N.} The usual notation for this relation is N ◃ G . {\\displaystyle N\\triangleleft G.}","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Normal_subgroup"}
