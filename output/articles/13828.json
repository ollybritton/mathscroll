{"title":"S-procedure","summary":"The S-procedure or S-lemma is a mathematical result that gives conditions under which a particular quadratic inequality is a consequence of another quadratic inequality. The S-procedure was developed independently in a number of different contexts[1][2] and has applications in control theory, linear algebra and mathematical optimization.","image":"fd0ff7103761124c95d8e2a1ec19fbd773599f4b.svg","url":"S-procedure"}
