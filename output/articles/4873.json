{"title":"Envelope (category theory)","summary":"In Category theory and related fields of mathematics, an envelope is a construction that generalizes the operations of \"exterior completion\", like completion of a locally convex space, or Stone–Čech compactification of a topological space. A dual construction is called refinement.","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Envelope_(category_theory)"}
