{"title":"Radical of an ideal","summary":"In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, the radical of an ideal I {\\displaystyle I} of a commutative ring is another ideal defined by the property that an element x {\\displaystyle x} is in the radical if and only if some power of x {\\displaystyle x} is in I {\\displaystyle I} . Taking the radical of an ideal is called radicalization. A radical ideal (or semiprime ideal) is an ideal that is equal to its radical. The radical of a primary ideal is a prime ideal.","image":"535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f.svg","url":"Radical_of_an_ideal"}
