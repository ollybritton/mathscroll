{"title":"Asymptote","summary":"In analytic geometry, an asymptote (/ˈæsɪmptoʊt/) of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as one or both of the x or y coordinates tends to infinity. In projective geometry and related contexts, an asymptote of a curve is a line which is tangent to the curve at a point at infinity.[1][2]","image":"Asymptotic_curve_hvo1.svg.png.webp","url":"Asymptote"}
