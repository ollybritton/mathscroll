{"title":"Windmill graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the windmill graph Wd(k,n) is an undirected graph constructed  for k ≥ 2 and n ≥ 2 by joining n copies of the complete graph Kk at a shared universal vertex. That is, it is a 1-clique-sum of these complete graphs.[1]","image":"Windmill_graph_Wd(5%2C4).svg.png.webp","url":"Windmill_graph"}
