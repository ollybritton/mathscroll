{"title":"Clarkson's inequalities","summary":"In mathematics, Clarkson's inequalities, named after James A. Clarkson, are results in the theory of Lp spaces.  They give bounds for the Lp-norms of the sum and difference of two measurable functions in Lp in terms of the Lp-norms of those functions individually.","image":"bb8ddf98e291770795ea7f2f847214cc12d64fc7.svg","url":"Clarkson's_inequalities"}
