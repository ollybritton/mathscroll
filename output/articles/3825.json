{"title":"De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (incidence geometry)","summary":"In incidence geometry, the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem, originally published by Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn and Paul Erdős (1948), states a lower bound on the number of lines determined by n points in a projective plane. By duality, this is also a bound on the number of intersection points determined by a configuration of lines.","image":"Nearpencil.svg.png.webp","url":"De_Bruijn–Erdős_theorem_(incidence_geometry)"}
