{"title":"Vector calculus","summary":"Vector calculus, or vector analysis, is  concerned with differentiation and integration of vector fields, primarily in 3-dimensional Euclidean space R 3 . {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}.} The term \"vector calculus\" is sometimes used as a synonym for the broader subject of multivariable calculus, which spans vector calculus as well as partial differentiation and multiple integration.  Vector calculus plays an important role in differential geometry and in the study of partial differential equations.  It is used extensively in physics and engineering, especially in the description of electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, and fluid flow.","image":"b00b2b4fd27c2cbffa02df568472f77b194a6db9.svg","url":"Vector_calculus"}
