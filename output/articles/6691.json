{"title":"Gyroelongated pentagonal bicupola","summary":"In geometry, the gyroelongated pentagonal bicupola is one of the Johnson solids (J46). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a pentagonal bicupola (J30 or J31) by inserting a decagonal antiprism between its congruent halves.","image":"Gyroelongated_pentagonal_bicupola.png.webp","url":"Gyroelongated_pentagonal_bicupola"}
