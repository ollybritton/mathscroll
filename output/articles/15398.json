{"title":"Symplectic filling","summary":"In mathematics, a filling of a manifold X is a cobordism W between X and the empty set. More to the point, the n-dimensional topological manifold X is the boundary of an (n + 1)-dimensional manifold W. Perhaps the most active area of current research is when n = 3, where one may consider certain types of fillings.","image":"1962bb17649b9b48383ed5083852c3856e8a7caf.svg","url":"Symplectic_filling"}
