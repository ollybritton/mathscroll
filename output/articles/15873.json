{"title":"Topos","summary":"In mathematics, a topos (UK: /ˈtɒpɒs/, US: /ˈtoʊpoʊs, ˈtoʊpɒs/; plural topoi /ˈtoʊpɔɪ/ or /ˈtɒpɔɪ/, or toposes) is a category that behaves like the category of sheaves of sets on a topological space (or more generally: on a site). Topoi behave much like the category of sets and possess a notion of localization; they are a direct generalization of point-set topology.[1]  The Grothendieck topoi find applications in algebraic geometry; the more general elementary topoi are used in logic.","image":"57fb6db9c16c4a07a802a640eacb67f60f4d9507.svg","url":"Topos"}
