{"title":"Kummer sum","summary":"In mathematics, Kummer sum is the name given to certain cubic Gauss sums for a prime modulus p, with p congruent to 1 modulo 3. They are named after Ernst Kummer, who made a conjecture about the statistical properties of their arguments, as complex numbers. These sums were known and used before Kummer, in the theory of cyclotomy.","image":"ddab6869d96c16dd84942c30b5ae57798952165b.svg","url":"Kummer_sum"}
