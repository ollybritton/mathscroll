{"title":"Cardinal number","summary":"In mathematics, cardinal numbers, or cardinals for short, are a generalization of the natural numbers used to measure the cardinality (size) of sets. The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number: the number of elements in the set. The transfinite cardinal numbers, often denoted using the Hebrew symbol â„µ {\\displaystyle \\aleph } (aleph) followed by a subscript, describe the sizes of infinite sets.","image":"306c55e6bc96d94db729ff5821c8f45a34c72bce.svg","url":"Cardinal_number"}
