{"title":"Sphere bundle","summary":"In the mathematical field of topology, a sphere bundle is a fiber bundle in which the fibers are spheres S n {\\displaystyle S^{n}} of some dimension n.[1] Similarly, in a disk bundle, the fibers are disks D n {\\displaystyle D^{n}} . From a topological perspective, there is no difference between sphere bundles and disk bundles: this is a consequence of the Alexander trick, which implies BTop ⁡ ( D n + 1 ) ≃ BTop ⁡ ( S n ) . {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {BTop} (D^{n+1})\\simeq \\operatorname {BTop} (S^{n}).}","image":"ee006452a59bf1eb29983b4412348b66517a2d23.svg","url":"Sphere_bundle"}
