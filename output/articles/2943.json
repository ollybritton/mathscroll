{"title":"Compactification (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, in general topology, compactification is the process or result of making a topological space into a compact space.[1] A compact space is a space in which every open cover of the space contains a finite subcover. The methods of compactification are various, but each is a way of controlling points from \"going off to infinity\" by in some way adding \"points at infinity\" or preventing such an \"escape\".","image":"Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png.webp","url":"Compactification_(mathematics)"}
