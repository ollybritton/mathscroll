{"title":"Laplace transform","summary":"In mathematics, the Laplace transform, named after its discoverer Pierre-Simon Laplace (/ləˈplɑːs/), is an integral transform that converts a function of a real variable (usually t {\\displaystyle t} , in the time domain) to a function of a complex variable s {\\displaystyle s} (in the complex frequency domain, also known as s-domain, or s-plane). The transform has many applications in science and engineering because it is a tool for solving differential equations.[1] In particular, it transforms ordinary differential equations into algebraic equations and convolution into multiplication.[2][3] For suitable functions f, the Laplace transform is the integral","image":"65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560.svg","url":"Laplace_transform"}
