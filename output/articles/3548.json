{"title":"Crisis (dynamical systems)","summary":"In applied mathematics and astrodynamics, in the theory of dynamical systems, a crisis is the sudden appearance or disappearance of a strange attractor as the parameters of a dynamical system are varied.[1][2] This global bifurcation occurs when a chaotic attractor comes into contact with an unstable periodic orbit or its stable manifold.[3] As the orbit approaches the unstable orbit it will diverge away from the previous attractor, leading to a qualitatively different behaviour. Crises can produce intermittent behaviour.","image":"Bifurcations_and_crises_of_Ikeda_attractor.png.webp","url":"Crisis_(dynamical_systems)"}
