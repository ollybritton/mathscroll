{"title":"Product metric","summary":"In mathematics, a product metric is a metric on the Cartesian product of finitely many metric spaces ( X 1 , d X 1 ) , … , ( X n , d X n ) {\\displaystyle (X_{1},d_{X_{1}}),\\ldots ,(X_{n},d_{X_{n}})} which metrizes the product topology. The most prominent product metrics are the p product metrics for a fixed p ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ) {\\displaystyle p\\in [1,\\infty )} : It is defined as the p norm of the n-vector of the distances measured in n subspaces:","image":"c9c96eb82884c5e816aa23d3b59156660aadb864.svg","url":"Product_metric"}
