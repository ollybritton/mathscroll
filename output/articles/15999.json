{"title":"Trapezoidal rule (differential equations)","summary":"In numerical analysis and scientific computing, the trapezoidal rule is a numerical method to solve ordinary differential equations derived from the trapezoidal rule for computing integrals. The trapezoidal rule is an implicit second-order method, which can be considered as both a Rungeâ€“Kutta method and a linear multistep method.","image":"9486bed7c8bc9286fa9b287f21b8ba27dc4215d7.svg","url":"Trapezoidal_rule_(differential_equations)"}
