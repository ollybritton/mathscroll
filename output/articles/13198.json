{"title":"Recession cone","summary":"In mathematics, especially convex analysis, the recession cone of a set A {\\displaystyle A} is a cone containing all vectors such that A {\\displaystyle A} recedes in that direction.  That is, the set extends outward in all the directions given by the recession cone.[1]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Recession_cone"}
