{"title":"Multiplier algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the multiplier algebra, denoted by M(A), of a C*-algebra A is a unital C*-algebra that is the largest unital C*-algebra that contains A as an ideal in a \"non-degenerate\" way. It is the noncommutative generalization of Stone–Čech compactification. Multiplier algebras were introduced by Busby (1968).","image":"cdb8aa8bc46ab0a5ca738358dd2954c428e5e839.svg","url":"Multiplier_algebra"}
