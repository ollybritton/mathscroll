{"title":"Marcel-Paul Schützenberger","summary":"Marcel-Paul \"Marco\" Schützenberger (24 October 1920 – 29 July 1996) was a French mathematician and Doctor of Medicine.  He worked in the fields of formal language, combinatorics, and information theory.[1] In addition to his formal results in mathematics, he was \"deeply involved in [a] struggle against the votaries of [neo-]Darwinism\",[2] a stance which has resulted in some mixed reactions from his peers and from critics of his stance on evolution. Several notable theorems and objects in mathematics as well as computer science bear his name (for example Schutzenberger group or the Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy). Paul Schützenberger was his great-grandfather.","image":"Schützenberger.jpeg.webp","url":"Marcel-Paul_Schützenberger"}
