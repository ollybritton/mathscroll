{"title":"Quasicircle","summary":"In mathematics, a quasicircle is a Jordan curve in the complex plane that is the image of a circle under a quasiconformal mapping of the plane onto itself. Originally introduced independently by Pfluger (1961) and Tienari (1962), in the older literature (in German) they were referred to as quasiconformal curves, a terminology which also applied to arcs.[1][2] In complex analysis and geometric function theory, quasicircles play a fundamental role in the description of the  universal Teichm√ºller space, through quasisymmetric homeomorphisms of the circle. Quasicircles also play an important role in complex dynamical systems.","image":"a7b20a776b1da142b96f97d3b356a7eabba7784b.svg","url":"Quasicircle"}
