{"title":"Net (polyhedron)","summary":"In geometry, a net of a polyhedron is an arrangement of non-overlapping edge-joined polygons in the plane which can be folded (along edges) to become the faces of the polyhedron. Polyhedral nets are a useful aid to the study of polyhedra and solid geometry in general, as they allow for physical models of polyhedra to be constructed from material such as thin cardboard.[1]","image":"Dodecahedron_flat.svg.png.webp","url":"Net_(polyhedron)"}
