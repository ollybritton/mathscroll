{"title":"Legendre's relation","summary":"In mathematics, Legendre's relation can be expressed in either of two forms: as a relation between complete elliptic integrals, or as a relation between periods and quasiperiods of elliptic functions. The two forms are equivalent as the periods and quasiperiods can be expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals. It was introduced (for complete  elliptic integrals) by A. M. Legendre (1811, 1825, p. 61).","image":"238d8b4f7f1790750f31fdc5f33122010102243d.svg","url":"Legendre's_relation"}
