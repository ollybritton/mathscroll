{"title":"Bimatrix game","summary":"In game theory, a bimatrix game is a simultaneous game for two players in which each player has a finite number of possible actions. The name comes from the fact that the normal form of such a game can be described by two matrices - matrix A {\\displaystyle A} describing the payoffs of player 1 and matrix B {\\displaystyle B} describing the payoffs of player 2.[1]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Bimatrix_game"}
