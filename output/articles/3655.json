{"title":"Curve fitting","summary":"Curve fitting[1][2] is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points,[3] possibly subject to constraints.[4][5] Curve fitting can involve either interpolation,[6][7] where an exact fit to the data is required, or smoothing,[8][9] in which a \"smooth\" function is constructed that approximately fits the data.  A related topic is regression analysis,[10][11] which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors. Fitted curves can be used as an aid for data visualization,[12][13] to infer values of a function where no data are available,[14] and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables.[15] Extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data,[16] and is subject to a degree of uncertainty[17] since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data.","image":"Regression_pic_assymetrique.gif","url":"Curve_fitting"}
