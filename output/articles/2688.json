{"title":"Cissoid","summary":"In geometry, a cissoid ((from Ancient Greek  κισσοειδής (kissoeidēs) 'ivy-shaped') is a plane curve generated from two given curves C1, C2 and a point O (the pole). Let L be a variable line passing through O and intersecting C1 at P1 and C2 at P2. Let P be the point on L so that O P ¯ = P 1 P 2 ¯ . {\\displaystyle {\\overline {OP}}={\\overline {P_{1}P_{2}}}.} (There are actually two such points but P is chosen so that P is in the same direction from O as P2 is from P1.) Then the locus of such points P is defined to be the cissoid of the curves C1, C2 relative to O.","image":"4d689c93129d7164afcc58abab79631cb1d725f1.svg","url":"Cissoid"}
