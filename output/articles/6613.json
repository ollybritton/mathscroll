{"title":"Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in algebraic geometry, the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem is a far-reaching result on coherent cohomology. It is a generalisation of the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, about complex manifolds, which is itself a generalisation of the classical Riemann–Roch theorem for line bundles on compact Riemann surfaces.","image":"Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch.jpg.webp","url":"Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch_theorem"}
