{"title":"Rarita–Schwinger equation","summary":"In theoretical physics, the Rarita–Schwinger equation is the relativistic field equation of spin-3/2 fermions. It is similar to the Dirac equation for spin-1/2 fermions. This equation was first introduced by William Rarita and Julian Schwinger in 1941.","image":"f5d88f372f8c740e62245cd332ef07b5576eccde.svg","url":"Rarita–Schwinger_equation"}
