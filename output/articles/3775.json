{"title":"Darboux integral","summary":"In the branch of mathematics known as real analysis, the Darboux integral is constructed using Darboux sums and is one possible definition of the integral of a function. Darboux integrals are equivalent to Riemann integrals, meaning that a function is Darboux-integrable if and only if it is Riemann-integrable, and the values of the two integrals, if they exist, are equal.[1] The definition of the Darboux integral has the advantage of being easier to apply in computations or proofs than that of the Riemann integral. Consequently, introductory textbooks on calculus and real analysis often develop Riemann integration using the Darboux integral, rather than the true Riemann integral.[2]  Moreover, the definition is readily extended to defining Riemann–Stieltjes integration.[3]  Darboux integrals are named after their inventor, Gaston Darboux (1842–1917).","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Darboux_integral"}
