{"title":"Hyperarithmetical theory","summary":"In recursion theory, hyperarithmetic theory is a generalization of Turing computability.  It has close connections with definability in second-order arithmetic and with weak systems of set theory such as Kripkeâ€“Platek set theory.  It is an important tool in effective descriptive set theory.[1]","image":"253bf5a8d60183537e1b309e490ed3cd7583f849.svg","url":"Hyperarithmetical_theory"}
