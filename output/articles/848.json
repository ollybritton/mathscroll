{"title":"Annulus theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the annulus theorem (formerly called the annulus conjecture) states roughly that the region between two well-behaved spheres is an annulus. It is closely related to the stable homeomorphism conjecture (now proved) which states that every orientation-preserving homeomorphism of Euclidean space is stable.","image":"275bdf09c104ca25dfb3ee436e1207b950360f3f.svg","url":"Annulus_theorem"}
