{"title":"Probability axioms","summary":"The Kolmogorov axioms are the foundations of probability theory introduced by Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov in 1933.[1] These axioms remain central and have direct contributions to mathematics, the physical sciences, and real-world probability cases.[2] An alternative approach to formalising probability, favoured by some Bayesians, is given by Cox's theorem.[3]","image":"Standard_deviation_diagram_micro.svg.png.webp","url":"Probability_axioms"}
