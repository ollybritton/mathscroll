{"title":"Invariant (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, an invariant is a property of a mathematical object (or a class of mathematical objects) which remains unchanged after operations or transformations of a certain type are applied to the objects.[1][2] The particular class of objects and type of transformations are usually indicated by the context in which the term is used. For example, the area of a triangle is an invariant with respect to isometries of the Euclidean plane. The phrases \"invariant under\" and \"invariant to\" a transformation are both used. More generally, an invariant with respect to an equivalence relation is a property that is constant on each equivalence class.[3]","image":"Endlessly_interlaced_pentagons_and_some_translations.svg.png.webp","url":"Invariant_(mathematics)"}
