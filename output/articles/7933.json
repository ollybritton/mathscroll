{"title":"Interpretation (logic)","summary":"An interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the symbols of a formal language. Many formal languages used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics.","image":"6a1cc103563219127f59aec7ed9327a3595566dd.svg","url":"Interpretation_(logic)"}
