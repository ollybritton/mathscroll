{"title":"Shoelace formula","summary":"The shoelace formula, shoelace algorithm, or shoelace method (also known as Gauss's area formula and the surveyor's formula)[1] is a mathematical algorithm to determine the area of a simple polygon whose vertices are described by their Cartesian coordinates in the plane.[2] It is called the shoelace formula because of the constant cross-multiplying for the coordinates making up the polygon, like threading shoelaces.[2] It has applications in surveying and forestry,[3] among other areas.","image":"Shoelace3.png.webp","url":"Shoelace_formula"}
