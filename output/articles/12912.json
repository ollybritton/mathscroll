{"title":"Quasi-free algebra","summary":"In abstract algebra, a quasi-free algebra is an associative algebra that satisfies the lifting property similar to that of a formally smooth algebra in commutative algebra. The notion was introduced by Cuntz and Quillen for the applications to cyclic homology.[1] A quasi-free algebra generalizes a free algebra, as well as the coordinate ring of a smooth affine complex curve. Because of the latter generalization, a quasi-free algebra can be thought of as signifying smoothness on a noncommutative space.[2]","image":"ec2da9cf0094c5948d4b0b56d8132683d902f7d0.svg","url":"Quasi-free_algebra"}
