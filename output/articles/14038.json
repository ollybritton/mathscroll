{"title":"Secant line","summary":"In geometry, a secant is a line that intersects a curve at a minimum of two distinct points.[1] The word secant comes from the Latin word secare, meaning to cut.[2] In the case of a circle, a secant intersects the circle at exactly two points. A chord is the line segment determined by the two points, that is, the interval on the secant whose ends are the two points.[3]","image":"CIRCLE_LINES-en.svg.png.webp","url":"Secant_line"}
