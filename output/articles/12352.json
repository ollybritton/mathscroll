{"title":"Polynomial regression","summary":"In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x). Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data.  For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Polynomial_regression"}
