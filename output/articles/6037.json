{"title":"General Leibniz rule","summary":"In calculus, the general Leibniz rule,[1] named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, generalizes the product rule (which is also known as \"Leibniz's rule\").  It states that if f {\\displaystyle f} and g {\\displaystyle g} are n {\\displaystyle n} -times differentiable functions, then the product f g {\\displaystyle fg} is also n {\\displaystyle n} -times differentiable and its n {\\displaystyle n} th derivative is given by","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"General_Leibniz_rule"}
