{"title":"Regular skew polyhedron","summary":"In geometry, the regular skew polyhedra are generalizations to the set of regular polyhedra which include the possibility of nonplanar faces or vertex figures. Coxeter looked at skew vertex figures which created new 4-dimensional regular polyhedra, and much later Branko Gr√ºnbaum looked at regular skew faces.[1]","image":"866d7b585cb39e0b6cb1dae4e593156a278b5e09.svg","url":"Regular_skew_polyhedron"}
