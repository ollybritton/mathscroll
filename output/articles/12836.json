{"title":"Quadric (algebraic geometry)","summary":"In mathematics, a quadric or quadric hypersurface is the subspace of N-dimensional space defined by a polynomial equation of degree 2 over a field. Quadrics are fundamental examples in algebraic geometry. The theory is simplified by working in projective space rather than affine space. An example is the quadric surface","image":"35c0006b7e4ba323eabb9ff1cf1bd31061095399.svg","url":"Quadric_(algebraic_geometry)"}
