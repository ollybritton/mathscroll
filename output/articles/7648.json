{"title":"Igusa quartic","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the Igusa quartic (also called the Castelnuovo–Richmond quartic  CR4 or the Castelnuovo–Richmond–Igusa quartic) is a quartic hypersurface in 4-dimensional projective space, studied by Igusa (1962). It is closely related to the moduli space of genus 2 curves with level 2 structure. It is the dual of the Segre cubic.","image":"c5c438ce0c52c4c0c4178fa789ebdac5b278f6b4.svg","url":"Igusa_quartic"}
