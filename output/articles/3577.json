{"title":"Crossed pentagonal cuploid","summary":"In geometry, the crossed pentagonal cupoloid or crossed pentagonal semicupola is one member of the infinite family of cuploids. It can be obtained as a slice of the great complex rhombicosidodecahedron. As in all cupolae, the base polygon has twice as many edges and vertices as the top; but in this case the base polygon is a degenerate {10/4} decagram, as the top is a {5/4} pentagon. Hence, the degenerate base is withdrawn and the triangles are connected to the squares instead.","image":"Crossed_pentagonal_cuploid.png.webp","url":"Crossed_pentagonal_cuploid"}
