{"title":"Bilinear time–frequency distribution","summary":"Bilinear time–frequency distributions, or quadratic time–frequency distributions, arise in a sub-field of signal analysis and signal processing called time–frequency signal processing, and, in the statistical analysis of time series data. Such methods are used where one needs to deal with a situation where the frequency composition of a signal may be changing over time;[1] this sub-field used to be called time–frequency signal analysis, and is now more often called time–frequency signal processing due to the progress in using these methods to a wide range of signal-processing problems.","image":"681484e1b74ced7b0be3761997c942c23bceed5c.svg","url":"Bilinear_time–frequency_distribution"}
