{"title":"Complex network","summary":"In the context of network theory, a complex network is a graph (network) with non-trivial topological featuresâ€”features that do not occur in simple networks such as lattices or random graphs but often occur in networks representing real systems. The study of complex networks is a young and active area of scientific research[1][2] (since 2000) inspired largely by empirical findings of real-world networks such as computer networks, biological networks, technological networks, brain networks,[3][4][5] climate networks and social networks.","image":"Internet_map_1024.jpg.webp","url":"Complex_network"}
