{"title":"Arithmaurel","summary":"The  Arithmaurel was a mechanical calculator that had a very intuitive user interface, especially for multiplying and dividing numbers because the result was displayed as soon as the operands were entered.  It was first patented in France by Timoleon Maurel, in 1842.[1] It received a gold medal at the French national show in Paris in 1849.[2]  Unfortunately its complexity and the fragility of its design prevented it from being manufactured.[3]","image":"Dessin_d'un_Arithmaurel.png.webp","url":"Arithmaurel"}
