{"title":"Marginal distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the marginal distribution of a subset of a collection of random variables is the probability distribution of the variables contained in the subset. It gives the probabilities of various values of the variables in the subset without reference to the values of the other variables. This contrasts with a conditional distribution, which gives the probabilities contingent upon the values of the other variables.","image":"d23aab6b88f1d8b074327d436e12fa496053e4c3.svg","url":"Marginal_distribution"}
