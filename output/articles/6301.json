{"title":"Glaisher's theorem","summary":"In number theory, Glaisher's theorem is an identity useful to the study of integer partitions.  Proved in 1883[1] by James Whitbread Lee Glaisher, it states that the number of partitions of an integer n {\\displaystyle n} into parts not divisible by d {\\displaystyle d} is equal to the number of partitions in which no part is repeated d {\\displaystyle d} or more times. This generalizes a result established in 1748 by Leonhard Euler for the case d = 2 {\\displaystyle d=2} .","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Glaisher's_theorem"}
