{"title":"Symmetric polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, a symmetric polynomial is a polynomial P(X1, X2, …, Xn) in n variables, such that if any of the variables are interchanged, one obtains the same polynomial. Formally, P is a symmetric polynomial if for any permutation σ of the subscripts 1, 2, ..., n one has P(Xσ(1), Xσ(2), …, Xσ(n)) = P(X1, X2, …, Xn).","image":"eeb796352f0de048444a7433717a738512b1c65d.svg","url":"Symmetric_polynomial"}
