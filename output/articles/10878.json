{"title":"Müntz–Szász theorem","summary":"The Müntz–Szász theorem is a basic result of approximation theory, proved by Herman Müntz in 1914 and Otto Szász (1884–1952) in 1916. Roughly speaking, the theorem shows to what extent the Weierstrass theorem on polynomial approximation can have holes dug into it, by restricting certain coefficients in the polynomials to be zero. The form of the result had been conjectured by Sergei Bernstein before it was proved.","image":"a3adb83c9d9a1f3c83f18cd2f6c34b942777a6ce.svg","url":"Müntz–Szász_theorem"}
