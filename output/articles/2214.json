{"title":"Carathéodory's extension theorem","summary":"In measure theory, Carathéodory's extension theorem (named after the mathematician Constantin Carathéodory) states that any pre-measure defined on a given ring of subsets R of  a given set Ω can be  extended to a measure on the σ-algebra generated by R, and this extension is unique if the pre-measure is σ-finite. Consequently, any pre-measure on a ring containing all intervals of real numbers can be extended to the Borel algebra of the set of real numbers. This is an extremely powerful result of measure theory, and leads, for example, to the Lebesgue measure.","image":"a69031c973bdef03ce24599b02b1cff9108a8421.svg","url":"Carathéodory's_extension_theorem"}
