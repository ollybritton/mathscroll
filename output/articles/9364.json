{"title":"Linear group","summary":"In mathematics, a matrix group is a group G consisting of invertible matrices over a specified field K, with the operation of matrix multiplication. A linear group is a group that is isomorphic to a matrix group (that is, admitting a faithful, finite-dimensional representation over K).","image":"3b2f4d0d6f2eb85b43ce72588bde2d68a831345a.svg","url":"Linear_group"}
