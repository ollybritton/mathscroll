{"title":"Music and mathematics","summary":"Music theory analyzes the pitch, timing, and structure of music. It uses mathematics to study elements of music such as tempo, chord progression, form, and meter. The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of set theory, abstract algebra and number theory.","image":"Spectrogram_of_violin.png.webp","url":"Music_and_mathematics"}
