{"title":"Bijective proof","summary":"In combinatorics, bijective proof is a proof technique for proving that two sets have equally many elements, or that the sets in two combinatorial classes have equal size, by finding a bijective function that maps one set one-to-one onto the other. This technique can be useful as a way of finding a formula for the number of elements of certain sets, by corresponding them with other sets that are easier to count. Additionally, the nature of the bijection itself often provides powerful insights into each or both of the sets.","image":"725c4e2aa7c38c6a757fdd282ac2dbc59435c472.svg","url":"Bijective_proof"}
