{"title":"Rotation of axes","summary":"In mathematics, a rotation of axes in two dimensions is a mapping from an xy-Cartesian coordinate system to an x′y′-Cartesian coordinate system in which the origin is kept fixed and the x′ and y′ axes are obtained by rotating the x  and y axes counterclockwise through an angle θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } .  A point P has coordinates (x, y) with respect to the original system and coordinates (x′, y′) with respect to the new system.[1]  In the new coordinate system, the point P will appear to have been rotated in the opposite direction, that is, clockwise through the angle θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } .  A rotation of axes in more than two dimensions is defined similarly.[2][3]  A rotation of axes is a linear map[4][5] and a rigid transformation.","image":"6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af.svg","url":"Rotation_of_axes"}
