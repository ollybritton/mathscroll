{"title":"Generic polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, a generic polynomial refers usually to a polynomial whose coefficients are indeterminates. For example, if a, b, and c are indeterminates, the generic polynomial of degree two in x is a x 2 + b x + c . {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c.}","image":"bebe03b03f574e0dd75bb8ddd5d4899bf4c6d6a8.svg","url":"Generic_polynomial"}
