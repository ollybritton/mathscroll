{"title":"Cap set","summary":"In affine geometry, a cap set is a subset of Z 3 n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} _{3}^{n}} (an n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional affine space over a three-element field) with no three elements in a line. The cap set problem is the problem of finding the size of the largest possible cap set, as a function of n {\\displaystyle n} .[1] The first few cap set sizes are 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, 112, ...
