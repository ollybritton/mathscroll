{"title":"Hom functor","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in category theory, hom-sets (i.e. sets of morphisms between objects) give rise to important functors to the category of sets. These functors are called hom-functors and have numerous applications in category theory and other branches of mathematics.","image":"11ccac011f0492f3b84e347e7a51047de614747d.svg","url":"Hom_functor"}
