{"title":"Herbrand–Ribet theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Herbrand–Ribet theorem is a result on the class group of certain number fields. It is a strengthening of Ernst Kummer's theorem to the effect that the prime p divides the class number of the cyclotomic field of p-th roots of unity if and only if p divides the numerator of the n-th Bernoulli number Bn for some n, 0 < n < p − 1. The Herbrand–Ribet theorem specifies what, in particular, it means when p divides such an Bn.","image":"091159ec1831a796613e58205637838b01f34c99.svg","url":"Herbrand–Ribet_theorem"}
