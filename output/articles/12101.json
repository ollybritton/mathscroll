{"title":"Petrov–Galerkin method","summary":"The Petrov–Galerkin method  is a mathematical method used to approximate solutions of partial differential equations which contain terms with odd order and where the test function and solution function belong to different function spaces.[1]  It can be viewed as an extension of Bubnov-Galerkin method where the  bases of test functions and solution functions are the same. In an operator formulation of the differential equation, Petrov–Galerkin method can be viewed as applying a projection that is not necessarily orthogonal, in contrast to Bubnov-Galerkin method.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Petrov–Galerkin_method"}
