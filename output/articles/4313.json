{"title":"Distribution (mathematics)","summary":"Distributions, also known as Schwartz distributions or generalized functions, are objects that generalize the classical notion of functions in mathematical analysis. Distributions make it possible to differentiate functions whose derivatives do not exist in the classical sense. In particular, any locally integrable function has a distributional derivative.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Distribution_(mathematics)"}
