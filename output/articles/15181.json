{"title":"Sub-Stonean space","summary":"In topology, a sub-Stonean space is a locally compact Hausdorff space such that any two open Ïƒ-compact disjoint subsets have disjoint compact closures. Related, an F-space, introduced by Gillman & Henriksen (1956), is a completely regular Hausdorff space for which every finitely generated ideal of the ring of real-valued continuous functions is principal, or equivalently every real-valued continuous function f {\\displaystyle f} can be written as f = g | f | {\\displaystyle f=g|f|} for some real-valued continuous function g {\\displaystyle g} . When dealing with compact spaces, the two concepts are the same, but in general, the concepts are different. The relationship between the sub-Stonean spaces and F-spaces is studied in Henriksen and Woods, 1989.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Sub-Stonean_space"}
