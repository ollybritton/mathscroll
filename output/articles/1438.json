{"title":"Beltrami's theorem","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, any (pseudo-)Riemannian metric determines a certain class of paths known as geodesics. Beltrami's theorem, named for Italian mathematician Eugenio Beltrami, is a result on the inverse problem of determining a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric from its geodesics.","image":"0d389defd5ddbbd266fc8148d71a27d7ed3cfdf5.svg","url":"Beltrami's_theorem"}
