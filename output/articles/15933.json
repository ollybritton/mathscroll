{"title":"Trace diagram","summary":"In mathematics, trace diagrams are a graphical means of performing computations in linear and multilinear algebra. They can be represented as (slightly modified) graphs in which some edges are labeled by matrices. The simplest trace diagrams represent the trace and determinant of a matrix. Several results in linear algebra, such as Cramer's Rule and the Cayleyâ€“Hamilton theorem, have simple diagrammatic proofs. They are closely related to Penrose's graphical notation.","image":"Trace_diagram_adjugate.png.webp","url":"Trace_diagram"}
