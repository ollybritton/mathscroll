{"title":"Icosahedral honeycomb","summary":"In geometry, the icosahedral honeycomb is one of four compact, regular, space-filling tessellations (or honeycombs) in hyperbolic 3-space. With Schl√§fli symbol {3,5,3}, there are three icosahedra around each edge, and 12 icosahedra around each vertex, in a regular dodecahedral vertex figure.","image":"H3_353_CC_center.png.webp","url":"Icosahedral_honeycomb"}
