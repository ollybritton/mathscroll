{"title":"Tensor product bundle","summary":"In differential geometry, the tensor product of vector bundles E, F (over same space X {\\displaystyle X} ) is a vector bundle, denoted by E ⊗ F, whose fiber over a point x ∈ X {\\displaystyle x\\in X} is the tensor product of vector spaces Ex ⊗ Fx.[1]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Tensor_product_bundle"}
