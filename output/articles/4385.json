{"title":"Dolgachev surface","summary":"In mathematics,  Dolgachev surfaces are certain simply connected elliptic surfaces, introduced by Igor DolgachevÂ (1981). They can be used to give examples of an infinite family of homeomorphic simply connected compact 4-manifolds, no two of which are diffeomorphic.","image":"6381fdad2b9f11954b1fc2db08bbaccf634ededa.svg","url":"Dolgachev_surface"}
