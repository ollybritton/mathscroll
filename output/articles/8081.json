{"title":"Isothermal coordinates","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in differential geometry, isothermal coordinates on a Riemannian manifold are local coordinates where the metric is conformal to the Euclidean metric. This means that in isothermal coordinates, the Riemannian metric locally has the form","image":"b0397a259af9c0b38d3861b1a179b70c33fae409.svg","url":"Isothermal_coordinates"}
