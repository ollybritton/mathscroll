{"title":"Strength (mathematical logic)","summary":"The relative strength of two systems of formal logic can be defined via model theory. Specifically, a logic α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } is said to be as strong as a logic β {\\displaystyle \\beta } if every elementary class in β {\\displaystyle \\beta } is an elementary class in α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } .[1]","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg","url":"Strength_(mathematical_logic)"}
