{"title":"McKean–Vlasov process","summary":"In probability theory, a McKean–Vlasov process is a stochastic process described by a stochastic differential equation where the coefficients of the diffusion depend on the distribution of the solution itself.[1][2] The equations are a model for Vlasov equation and were first studied by Henry McKean in 1966.[3]","image":"f0b7bd2d4967ad04848d49ccdeafa4e2614d298d.svg","url":"McKean–Vlasov_process"}
