{"title":"Kelmans–Seymour conjecture","summary":"In graph theory, the Kelmans–Seymour conjecture states that every 5-vertex-connected graph that is not planar contains a subdivision of the 5-vertex complete graph K5. It is named for Paul Seymour and Alexander Kelmans, who independently described the conjecture; Seymour in 1977 and Kelmans in 1979.[1][2] A proof was announced in 2016, and published in four papers in 2020.","image":"K5-in-Crown12.svg.png.webp","url":"Kelmans–Seymour_conjecture"}
