{"title":"Integral linear operator","summary":"An integral bilinear form is a bilinear functional that belongs to the continuous dual space of X ⊗ ^ ϵ Y {\\displaystyle X{\\widehat {\\otimes }}_{\\epsilon }Y} , the injective tensor product of the locally convex topological vector spaces (TVSs) X and Y. An integral linear operator is a continuous linear operator that arises in a canonical way from an integral bilinear form.","image":"4218a2a96bf2fa0d5520f26effc0f7bf44c540c9.svg","url":"Integral_linear_operator"}
