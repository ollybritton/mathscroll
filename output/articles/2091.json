{"title":"Bézout's theorem","summary":"Bézout's theorem is a statement in algebraic geometry concerning the number of common zeros of n polynomials in n indeterminates. In its original form the theorem states that in general the number of common zeros equals the product of the degrees of the polynomials.[1] It is named after Étienne Bézout.","image":"4cccb5a6a2f1acab4ca255e0be86c224ed82282a.svg","url":"Bézout's_theorem"}
