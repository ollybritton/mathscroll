{"title":"Bowyer–Watson algorithm","summary":"In computational geometry, the Bowyer–Watson algorithm is a method for computing the Delaunay triangulation of a finite set of points in any number of dimensions. The algorithm can be also used to obtain a Voronoi diagram of the points, which is the dual graph of the Delaunay triangulation.","image":"Bowyer-Watson_0.png.webp","url":"Bowyer–Watson_algorithm"}
