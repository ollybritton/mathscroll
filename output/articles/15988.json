{"title":"Transseries","summary":"In mathematics, the field T L E {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {T} ^{LE}} of logarithmic-exponential transseries is a non-Archimedean ordered differential field which extends comparability of asymptotic growth rates of elementary nontrigonometric functions to a much broader class of objects. Each log-exp transseries represents a formal asymptotic behavior, and it can be manipulated formally, and when it converges (or in every case if using special semantics such as through infinite surreal numbers), corresponds to actual behavior. Transseries can also be convenient for representing functions.  Through their inclusion of exponentiation and logarithms, transseries are a strong generalization of the power series at infinity ( ∑ n = 0 ∞ a n x n {\\textstyle \\sum _{n=0}^{\\infty }{\\frac {a_{n}}{x^{n}}}} ) and other similar asymptotic expansions.","image":"484bc5ce619b369e92a0da19d2a0b243006f9b14.svg","url":"Transseries"}
