{"title":"Spread (projective geometry)","summary":"A frequently studied problem in discrete geometry is to identify ways in which an object can be covered by other simpler objects such as points, lines, and planes. In projective geometry, a specific instance of this problem that has numerous applications is determining whether, and how, a projective space can be covered by pairwise disjoint subspaces which have the same dimension; such a partition is called a spread. Specifically, a spread of a projective space P G ( d , K ) {\\displaystyle PG(d,K)} , where d â‰¥ 1 {\\displaystyle d\\geq 1} is an integer and K {\\displaystyle K} a division ring, is a set of r {\\displaystyle r} -dimensional subspaces, for some 0 < r < d {\\displaystyle 0<r<d} such that every point of the space lies in exactly one of the elements of the spread.","image":"c1e46921a67355a2648c7b29beff59c256fc83b1.svg","url":"Spread_(projective_geometry)"}
