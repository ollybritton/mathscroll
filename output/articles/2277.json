{"title":"Cartan connection","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a Cartan connection is a flexible generalization of the notion of an affine connection. It may also be regarded as a specialization of the general concept of a principal connection, in which the geometry of the principal bundle is tied to the geometry of the base manifold using a solder form. Cartan connections describe the geometry of manifolds modelled on homogeneous spaces.","image":"b8f80a9d9b4cf9b0b6f562d5eff0f290da478ebe.svg","url":"Cartan_connection"}
