{"title":"Elementary symmetric polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in commutative algebra, the elementary symmetric polynomials are one type of basic building block for symmetric polynomials, in the sense that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial in elementary symmetric polynomials.  That is, any symmetric polynomial P is given by an expression involving only additions and multiplication of constants and elementary symmetric polynomials.  There is one elementary symmetric polynomial of degree d in n variables for each positive integer d â‰¤ n, and it is formed by adding together all distinct products of d distinct variables.","image":"a50ff12e8dfdfe323f0748a0ea434f6b2f4915f1.svg","url":"Elementary_symmetric_polynomial"}
