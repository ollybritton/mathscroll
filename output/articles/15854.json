{"title":"Topological homomorphism","summary":"In functional analysis, a topological homomorphism or simply homomorphism (if no confusion will arise) is the analog of homomorphisms for the category of topological vector spaces (TVSs). This concept is of considerable importance in functional analysis and the famous open mapping theorem gives a sufficient condition for a continuous linear map between Fr√©chet spaces to be a topological homomorphism.","image":"71ed0cbbb508da53826d7ea1f288394da3664937.svg","url":"Topological_homomorphism"}
