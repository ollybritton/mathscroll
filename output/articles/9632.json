{"title":"Locally convex topological vector space","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, locally convex topological vector spaces (LCTVS) or locally convex spaces are examples of topological vector spaces (TVS) that generalize normed spaces. They can be defined as topological vector spaces whose topology is generated by translations of balanced, absorbent, convex sets. Alternatively they can be defined as a vector space with a family of seminorms, and a topology can be defined in terms of that family. Although in general such spaces are not necessarily normable, the existence of a convex local base for the zero vector is strong enough for the Hahnâ€“Banach theorem to hold, yielding a sufficiently rich theory of continuous linear functionals.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Locally_convex_topological_vector_space"}
