{"title":"Monostatic polytope","summary":"In geometry, a monostatic polytope (or unistable polyhedron) is a d-polytope which \"can stand on only one face\". They were described in 1969 by J. H. Conway, M. Goldberg, R. K. Guy and K. C. Knowlton. The monostatic polytope in 3-space constructed independently by Guy and Knowlton has 19 faces. In 2012, Andras Bezdek discovered an 18-face solution,[1] and in 2014, Alex Reshetov published a 14-face object.[2]","image":"R._K._Guy_and_J._H._Conway_monostatic_polyhedron.stl.png.webp","url":"Monostatic_polytope"}
