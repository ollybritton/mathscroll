{"title":"Collectionwise Hausdorff space","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of topology, a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} is said to be collectionwise Hausdorff if given any closed discrete subset of X {\\displaystyle X} , there is a pairwise disjoint family of open sets with each point of the discrete subset contained in exactly one of the open sets.[1]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Collectionwise_Hausdorff_space"}
