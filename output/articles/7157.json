{"title":"Hexagonal crystal family","summary":"In crystallography, the hexagonal crystal family is one of the six crystal families, which includes two crystal systems (hexagonal and trigonal) and two lattice systems (hexagonal and rhombohedral). While commonly confused, the trigonal  crystal system and the rhombohedral lattice system are not equivalent (see section crystal systems below).[1] In particular, there are crystals that have trigonal symmetry but belong to the hexagonal lattice (such as Î±-quartz).","image":"Rhombohedral.svg.png.webp","url":"Hexagonal_crystal_family"}
