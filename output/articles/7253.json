{"title":"Hilbert system","summary":"In logic, especially mathematical logic, a Hilbert system, sometimes called Hilbert calculus, Hilbert-style deductive system or Hilbertâ€“Ackermann system, is a type of system of formal deduction attributed to Gottlob Frege[1] and David Hilbert. These deductive systems are most often studied for first-order logic, but are of interest for other logics as well.","image":"Deduction_architecture.png.webp","url":"Hilbert_system"}
