{"title":"Inaccessible cardinal","summary":"In set theory, an uncountable cardinal is inaccessible if it cannot be obtained from smaller cardinals by the usual operations of cardinal arithmetic.  More precisely, a cardinal κ is strongly inaccessible if it is uncountable, it is not a sum of fewer than κ cardinals smaller than κ, and α < κ {\\displaystyle \\alpha <\\kappa } implies 2 α < κ {\\displaystyle 2^{\\alpha }<\\kappa } .","image":"5cb38ae0a409608fe26ac1f6073e1916b60fcf5b.svg","url":"Inaccessible_cardinal"}
