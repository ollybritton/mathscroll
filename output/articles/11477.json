{"title":"Order-4 dodecahedral honeycomb","summary":"In hyperbolic geometry, the order-4 dodecahedral honeycomb is one of four compact regular space-filling tessellations (or honeycombs) of hyperbolic 3-space. With Schl√§fli symbol {5,3,4}, it has four dodecahedra around each edge, and 8 dodecahedra around each vertex in an octahedral arrangement. Its vertices are constructed from 3 orthogonal axes. Its dual is the order-5 cubic honeycomb.","image":"H3_534_CC_center.png.webp","url":"Order-4_dodecahedral_honeycomb"}
