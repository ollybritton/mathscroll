{"title":"PROP (category theory)","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a PROP is a symmetric strict monoidal category whose objects are the natural numbers n identified with the finite sets { 0 , 1 , … , n − 1 } {\\displaystyle \\{0,1,\\ldots ,n-1\\}} and whose tensor product is given on objects by the addition on numbers.[1] Because of “symmetric”, for each n, the symmetric group on n letters is given as a subgroup of the automorphism group of n. The name PROP is an abbreviation of \"PROduct and Permutation category\".","image":"8c9d880514ad2c67d30e2bacec2a815839c59beb.svg","url":"PROP_(category_theory)"}
