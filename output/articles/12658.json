{"title":"Propagation graph","summary":"Propagation graphs are a mathematical modelling method for radio propagation channels. A propagation graph is a signal flow graph in which vertices represent transmitters, receivers or scatterers. Edges in the graph model propagation conditions between vertices. Propagation graph models were initially developed by Troels Pedersen, et al. for multipath propagation in scenarios with multiple scattering, such as indoor radio propagation.[1][2][3] It has later been applied in many other scenarios.","image":"PropagationGraph.png.webp","url":"Propagation_graph"}
