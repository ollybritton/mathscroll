{"title":"Gyration","summary":"In geometry, a gyration is a rotation in a discrete subgroup of symmetries of the Euclidean plane such that the subgroup does not also contain a reflection symmetry whose axis passes through the center of rotational symmetry. In the orbifold corresponding to the subgroup, a gyration corresponds to a rotation point that does not lie on a mirror, called a gyration point.[1]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Gyration"}
