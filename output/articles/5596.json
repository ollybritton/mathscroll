{"title":"Forney algorithm","summary":"In coding theory, the Forney algorithm (or Forney's algorithm) calculates the error values at known error locations.  It is used as one of the steps in decoding BCH codes and Reedâ€“Solomon codes (a subclass of BCH codes).  George David Forney Jr. developed the algorithm.[1]","image":"f23a5744fc824bb87e9f9ad85755237ba35c101f.svg","url":"Forney_algorithm"}
