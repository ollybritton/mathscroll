{"title":"Reshetnyak gluing theorem","summary":"In metric geometry, the Reshetnyak gluing theorem gives information on the structure of a geometric object built by using as building blocks other geometric objects, belonging to a well defined class. Intuitively, it states that a manifold obtained by joining (i.e. \"gluing\") together, in a precisely defined way, other manifolds having a given property inherit that very same property.","image":"af4a0955af42beb5f85aa05fb8c07abedc13990d.svg","url":"Reshetnyak_gluing_theorem"}
