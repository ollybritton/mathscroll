{"title":"Logarithmic growth","summary":"In mathematics, logarithmic growth describes a phenomenon whose size or cost can be described as a logarithm function of some input. e.g. y = C log (x). Any logarithm base can be used, since one can be converted to another by multiplying by a fixed constant.[1] Logarithmic growth is the inverse of exponential growth and is very slow.[2]","image":"Log.svg.png.webp","url":"Logarithmic_growth"}
