{"title":"Continuous function (set theory)","summary":"In set theory, a continuous function is a sequence of ordinals such that the values assumed at limit stages are the limits (limit suprema and limit infima) of all values at previous stages. More formally, let γ be an ordinal, and s := ⟨ s α | α < γ ⟩ {\\displaystyle s:=\\langle s_{\\alpha }|\\alpha <\\gamma \\rangle } be a γ-sequence of ordinals.  Then s is continuous if at every limit ordinal β < γ,","image":"1cb375dc27ff410390595cd21000151a9770fdf4.svg","url":"Continuous_function_(set_theory)"}
