{"title":"Incomplete Cholesky factorization","summary":"In numerical analysis, an incomplete Cholesky factorization of a symmetric positive definite matrix is a sparse approximation of the Cholesky factorization. An incomplete Cholesky factorization is often used as a preconditioner for algorithms like the conjugate gradient method.","image":"add78d8608ad86e54951b8c8bd6c8d8416533d20.svg","url":"Incomplete_Cholesky_factorization"}
