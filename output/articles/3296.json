{"title":"Constructivism (philosophy of mathematics)","summary":"In the philosophy of mathematics, constructivism asserts that it is necessary to find (or \"construct\") a specific example of a mathematical object in order to prove that an example exists. Contrastingly, in classical mathematics, one can prove the existence of a mathematical object without \"finding\" that object explicitly, by assuming its non-existence and then deriving a contradiction from that assumption. Such a proof by contradiction might be called non-constructive, and a constructivist might reject it. The constructive viewpoint involves a verificational interpretation of the existential quantifier, which is at odds with its classical interpretation.","image":"f9887e89149906db64050ac9756a1253044905cd.svg","url":"Constructivism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)"}
