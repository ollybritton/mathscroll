{"title":"Rhombitetraoctagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the rhombitetraoctagonal tiling is a uniform tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It has Schl√§fli symbol of rr{8,4}. It can be seen as constructed as a rectified tetraoctagonal tiling, r{8,4}, as well as an expanded order-4 octagonal tiling or expanded order-8 square tiling.","image":"H2_tiling_248-5.png.webp","url":"Rhombitetraoctagonal_tiling"}
