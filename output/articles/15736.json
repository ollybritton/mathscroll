{"title":"Thomas Harriot","summary":"Thomas Harriot (/ˈhæriət/;[2] c. 1560 – 2 July 1621), also spelled Harriott, Hariot or Heriot, was an English astronomer, mathematician, ethnographer and translator to whom the theory of refraction is attributed. Thomas Harriot was also recognized for his contributions in navigational techniques,[3] working closely with John White to create advanced maps for navigation.[3] While Harriot worked extensively on numerous papers on the subjects of astronomy, mathematics and navigation, he remains obscure because he published little of it,[4] namely only The Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (1588).[3] This book includes descriptions of English settlements and financial issues in Virginia at the time.[3] He is sometimes credited with the introduction of the potato to the British Isles.[5] Harriot was the first person to make a drawing of the Moon through a telescope, on 5 August 1609, about four months before Galileo Galilei.[6]","image":"Harriot_at_Syon_Park.JPG.webp","url":"Thomas_Harriot"}
