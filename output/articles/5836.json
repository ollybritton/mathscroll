{"title":"Functional equation (L-function)","summary":"In mathematics, the L-functions of number theory are expected to have several characteristic properties, one of which is that they satisfy certain functional equations. There is an elaborate theory of what these equations should be, much of which is still conjectural.","image":"e239c6565f52a6235a75b6e554f26a1512bce1ea.svg","url":"Functional_equation_(L-function)"}
