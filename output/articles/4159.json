{"title":"Diophantine quintuple","summary":"In number theory, a diophantine m-tuple is a set of m positive integers { a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 , … , a m } {\\displaystyle \\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4},\\ldots ,a_{m}\\}} such that a i a j + 1 {\\displaystyle a_{i}a_{j}+1} is a perfect square for any 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m . {\\displaystyle 1\\leq i<j\\leq m.} [1] A set of m positive rational numbers with the similar property that the product of any two is one less than a rational square is known as a rational diophantine m-tuple.","image":"a622be3b5e27c0588e1ff9fb21b6b6bdd469bb18.svg","url":"Diophantine_quintuple"}
