{"title":"Herbrand's theorem","summary":"Herbrand's theorem is a fundamental result of mathematical logic obtained by Jacques Herbrand (1930).[1] It essentially allows a certain kind of reduction of first-order logic to propositional logic. Although Herbrand originally proved his theorem for arbitrary formulas of first-order logic,[2] the simpler version shown here, restricted to formulas in prenex form containing only existential quantifiers, became more popular.","image":"8b5248f9191536dd7cc9a956fd86882fb9266a77.svg","url":"Herbrand's_theorem"}
