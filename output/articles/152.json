{"title":"Cardioid","summary":"In geometry, a cardioid (from Greek  καρδιά (kardiá) 'heart') is a plane curve traced by a point on the perimeter of a circle that is rolling around a fixed circle of the same radius. It can also be defined as an epicycloid having a single cusp. It is also a type of sinusoidal spiral, and an inverse curve of the parabola with the focus as the center of inversion.[1] A cardioid can also be defined as the set of points of reflections of a fixed point on a circle through all tangents to the circle.[2]","image":"Cardiod_animation.gif","url":"A%2fCardioid"}
