{"title":"Cohomological descent","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a cohomological descent is, roughly, a \"derived\" version of a fully faithful descent in the classical descent theory. This point is made precise by the below: the following are equivalent:[1] in an appropriate setting, given a map a from a simplicial space X to a space S,","image":"794e7760edc896e8e65072858a8589f69ee43b61.svg","url":"Cohomological_descent"}
