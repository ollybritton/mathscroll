{"title":"Symmetric product (topology)","summary":"In algebraic topology, the nth symmetric product of a topological space consists of the unordered n-tuples of its elements. If one fixes a  basepoint, there is a canonical way of embedding the lower-dimensional symmetric products into the higher-dimensional ones. That way, one can consider the colimit over the symmetric products, the infinite symmetric product. This construction can easily be extended to give a homotopy functor.","image":"8e2dca0712d6ffb1e7d080ed49b94d3eec4a8688.svg","url":"Symmetric_product_(topology)"}
