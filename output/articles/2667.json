{"title":"Circular ensemble","summary":"In the theory of random matrices, the circular ensembles are  measures on  spaces of unitary matrices introduced by Freeman Dyson as modifications of the Gaussian matrix ensembles.[1] The three main examples are the circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) on symmetric unitary matrices, the circular unitary ensemble (CUE) on unitary matrices, and  the circular symplectic ensemble (CSE) on self dual unitary quaternionic  matrices.","image":"da4c927d3dd0563b91e24f05aa525dd75437c005.svg","url":"Circular_ensemble"}
