{"title":"Holomorphic tangent bundle","summary":"In mathematics, and especially complex geometry, the holomorphic tangent bundle of a complex manifold M {\\displaystyle M} is the holomorphic analogue of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold. The fibre of the holomorphic tangent bundle over a point is the holomorphic tangent space, which is the tangent space of the underlying smooth manifold, given the structure of a complex vector space via the almost complex structure J {\\displaystyle J} of the complex manifold M {\\displaystyle M} .","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Holomorphic_tangent_bundle"}
