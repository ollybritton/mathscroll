{"title":"Conjugacy problem","summary":"In abstract algebra, the conjugacy problem for a group G with a given presentation is the decision problem of determining, given two words x and y in G, whether or not they represent conjugate elements of G.  That is, the problem is to determine whether there exists an element z of G such that","image":"b76178012e8fba5e817d83564c00ebc6378a7c51.svg","url":"Conjugacy_problem"}
