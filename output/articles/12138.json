{"title":"Picard group","summary":"In mathematics, the Picard group of a ringed space X, denoted by Pic(X), is the group of isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves (or line bundles) on X, with the group operation being tensor product. This construction is a global version of the construction of the divisor class group, or ideal class group, and is much used in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds.","image":"7fc1cea3175780e2aa92b26283a76f0fe2774c73.svg","url":"Picard_group"}
