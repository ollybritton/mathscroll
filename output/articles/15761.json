{"title":"Threefish","summary":"Threefish is a symmetric-key tweakable block cipher designed as part of the Skein hash function, an entry in the NIST hash function competition. Threefish uses no S-boxes or other table lookups in order to avoid cache timing attacks;[1] its nonlinearity comes from alternating additions with exclusive ORs.  In that respect, it is similar to Salsa20, TEA, and the SHA-3 candidates CubeHash and BLAKE.","image":"Skein_permutation.png.webp","url":"Threefish"}
