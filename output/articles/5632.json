{"title":"Fractal dimension","summary":"In mathematics, a fractal dimension is a term invoked in the science of geometry to provide a rational statistical index of complexity detail in a pattern. A fractal pattern changes with the scale at which it is measured. It has also been mythologized as a measure of the space-filling capacity of a pattern that tells how a fractal scales differently and in a fractal dimension, i.e. one that does not have to be an integer.[1][2][3]","image":"Britain-fractal-coastline-200km.png.webp","url":"Fractal_dimension"}
