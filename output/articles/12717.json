{"title":"Pseudoelementary class","summary":"In logic, a pseudoelementary class is a class of structures derived from an elementary class (one definable in first-order logic) by omitting some of its sorts and relations.  It is the mathematical logic counterpart of the notion in category theory of (the codomain of) a forgetful functor, and in physics of (hypothesized) hidden variable theories purporting to explain quantum mechanics.  Elementary classes are (vacuously) pseudoelementary but the converse is not always true; nevertheless pseudoelementary classes share some of the properties of elementary classes such as being closed under ultraproducts.","image":"36973b3ffc0a1495f4d98b733aecfa84c4f678b6.svg","url":"Pseudoelementary_class"}
