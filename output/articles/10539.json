{"title":"Mitchell's embedding theorem","summary":"Mitchell's embedding theorem, also known as the Freydâ€“Mitchell theorem or the full embedding theorem, is a result about abelian categories; it essentially states that these categories, while rather abstractly defined, are in fact concrete categories of modules. This allows one to use element-wise diagram chasing proofs in these categories. The theorem is named after Barry Mitchell and Peter Freyd.","image":"afa5604e915c63a822dc7d9e8d23cf45fb4e7a43.svg","url":"Mitchell's_embedding_theorem"}
