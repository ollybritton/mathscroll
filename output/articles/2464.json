{"title":"Chamfer (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, chamfering or edge-truncation is a topological operator that modifies one polyhedron into another. It is similar to expansion, moving faces apart and outward, but also maintains the original vertices. For polyhedra, this operation adds a new hexagonal face in place of each original edge.","image":"Polyhedron_6_unchamfered.png.webp","url":"Chamfer_(geometry)"}
