{"title":"Ribet's theorem","summary":"Ribet's theorem (earlier called the epsilon conjecture or ε-conjecture) is part of number theory. It concerns properties of Galois representations associated with modular forms. It was proposed by Jean-Pierre Serre and proven by Ken Ribet. The proof was a significant step towards the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT). As shown by Serre and Ribet, the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (whose status was unresolved at the time) and the epsilon conjecture together imply that FLT is true.","image":"05b524bc0cb89d8fd888ad15d0b1cd762289266e.svg","url":"Ribet's_theorem"}
