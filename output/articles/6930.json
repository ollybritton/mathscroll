{"title":"Hartman–Grobman theorem","summary":"In mathematics, in the study of dynamical systems, the Hartman–Grobman theorem or linearisation theorem is a theorem about the local behaviour of dynamical systems in the neighbourhood of a hyperbolic equilibrium point.  It asserts that linearisation—a natural simplification of the system—is effective in predicting qualitative patterns of behaviour. The theorem owes its name to Philip Hartman and David M. Grobman.","image":"b29228885ebf915e83191e7feb49a94582eb0de4.svg","url":"Hartman–Grobman_theorem"}
