{"title":"Equivalent definitions of mathematical structures","summary":"In mathematics, equivalent definitions are used in two somewhat different ways. First, within a particular mathematical theory (for example, Euclidean geometry), a notion (for example, ellipse or minimal surface) may have more than one definition. These definitions are equivalent in the context of a given mathematical structure (Euclidean space, in this case). Second, a mathematical structure may have more than one definition (for example, topological space has at least seven definitions; ordered field has at least two definitions).","image":"922442a5575888b509d846450a3fcf1ae09c2f8d.svg","url":"Equivalent_definitions_of_mathematical_structures"}
