{"title":"Plethystic exponential","summary":"In mathematics, the plethystic exponential is a certain operator defined on (formal) power series which, like the usual exponential function, translates addition into multiplication. This exponential operator appears naturally in the theory of symmetric functions, as a concise relation between the generating series for elementary, complete and power sums homogeneous symmetric polynomials in many variables. Its name comes from the operation called plethysm, defined in the context of so-called lambda rings.","image":"5aacb21250f99f332a57763ecb7f92e3637ade19.svg","url":"Plethystic_exponential"}
