{"title":"Collapse (topology)","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, a collapse reduces a simplicial complex (or more generally, a CW complex) to a homotopy-equivalent subcomplex. Collapses, like CW complexes themselves, were invented by J. H. C. Whitehead.[1] Collapses find applications in computational homology.[2]","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Collapse_(topology)"}
