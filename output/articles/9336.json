{"title":"Line graph","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the line graph of an undirected graph G is another graph  L(G) that represents the adjacencies between edges of G.  L(G) is constructed in the following way: for each edge in G, make a vertex in  L(G); for every two edges in G that have a vertex in common, make an edge between their corresponding vertices in  L(G).","image":"Line_graph_construction_1.svg.png.webp","url":"Line_graph"}
