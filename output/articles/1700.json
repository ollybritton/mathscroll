{"title":"Birkhoff algorithm","summary":"Birkhoff's algorithm (also called Birkhoff-von-Neumann algorithm) is an algorithm for decomposing a bistochastic matrix into a convex combination of permutation matrices. It was published by Garrett Birkhoff in 1946.[1][2]: 36  It has many applications. One such application is for the problem of fair random assignment: given a randomized allocation of items, Birkhoff's algorithm can decompose it into a lottery on deterministic allocations.","image":"c5391a0719a52d6f46fe278070a804e1161d124f.svg","url":"Birkhoff_algorithm"}
