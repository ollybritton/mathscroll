{"title":"Leverage (statistics)","summary":"In statistics and in particular in regression analysis, leverage is a measure of how far away the independent variable values of an observation are from those of the other observations. High-leverage points, if any, are outliers with respect to the independent variables. That is, high-leverage points have no neighboring points in R p {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{p}} space, where p {\\displaystyle {p}} is the number of independent variables in a regression model. This makes the fitted model likely to pass close to a high leverage observation.[1] Hence high-leverage points have the potential to cause large changes in the parameter estimates when they are deleted i.e., to be influential points. Although an influential point will typically have high leverage, a high leverage point is not necessarily an influential point. The leverage is typically defined as the diagonal elements of the hat matrix.","image":"40a670215fd4556c78acd92bdc55d472548b7a21.svg","url":"Leverage_(statistics)"}
