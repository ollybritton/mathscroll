{"title":"Tangent half-angle formula","summary":"In trigonometry, tangent half-angle formulas relate the tangent of half of an angle to trigonometric functions of the entire angle. The tangent of half an angle is the stereographic projection of the circle onto a line. Among these formulas are the following:","image":"84fb3ea7a5c8629322fc19a50d20c1448ee14f3a.svg","url":"Tangent_half-angle_formula"}
