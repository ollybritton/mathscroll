{"title":"Order-5 octahedral honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the order-5 octahedral honeycomb is a regular space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) with Schl√§fli symbol {3,4,5}. It has five octahedra {3,4} around each edge. All vertices are ultra-ideal (existing beyond the ideal boundary) with infinitely many octahedra existing around each vertex in an order-5 square tiling vertex arrangement.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Order-5_octahedral_honeycomb"}
