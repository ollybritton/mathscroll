{"title":"List of computer algebra systems","summary":"The following tables provide a comparison of computer algebra systems (CAS).[1][2][3] A CAS is a package comprising a set of algorithms for performing symbolic manipulations on algebraic objects, a language to implement them, and an environment in which to use the language.[4][5] A CAS may include a user interface and graphics capability; and to be effective may require a large library of algorithms, efficient data structures and a fast kernel.[6]","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_computer_algebra_systems"}
