{"title":"Integrable system","summary":"In mathematics, integrability is a property of certain dynamical systems. While there are several distinct formal definitions, informally speaking, an integrable system is a dynamical system with sufficiently many conserved quantities, or first integrals, such that its behaviour has far fewer degrees of freedom than the dimensionality of its phase space; that is, its evolution is restricted to a submanifold within its phase space.","image":"134afa8ff09fdddd24b06f289e92e3a045092bd1.svg","url":"Integrable_system"}
