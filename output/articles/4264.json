{"title":"Discrete space","summary":"In topology, a discrete space is a particularly simple example of a topological space or similar structure, one in which the points form a discontinuous sequence, meaning they are isolated from each other in a certain sense. The discrete topology is the finest topology that can be given on a set. Every subset is open in the discrete topology so that in particular, every singleton subset is an open set in the discrete topology.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Discrete_space"}
