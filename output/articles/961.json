{"title":"Arf invariant of a knot","summary":"In the mathematical  field of knot theory, the Arf invariant of a knot, named after Cahit Arf, is a knot invariant obtained from a quadratic form associated to a Seifert surface.  If F is a Seifert surface of a knot, then the homology group H1(F, Z/2Z) has a quadratic form whose value is the number of full twists mod 2 in a neighborhood of an embedded circle representing an element of the homology group. The Arf invariant of this quadratic form is the Arf invariant of the knot.","image":"ff6e2969b838ae3f83e2ac082fd799ee0c34c7a4.svg","url":"Arf_invariant_of_a_knot"}
