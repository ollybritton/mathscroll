{"title":"Binary tetrahedral group","summary":"In mathematics, the binary tetrahedral group, denoted 2T or ⟨2,3,3⟩,[2] is a certain nonabelian group of order 24. It is an extension of the tetrahedral group T or (2,3,3) of order 12 by a cyclic group of order 2, and is the preimage of the tetrahedral group under the 2:1 covering homomorphism Spin(3) → SO(3) of the special orthogonal group by the spin group. It follows that the binary tetrahedral group is a discrete subgroup of Spin(3) of order 24. The complex reflection group named 3(24)3 by G.C. Shephard or 3[3]3 and  by Coxeter, is isomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group.","image":"CDel_3node.png.webp","url":"Binary_tetrahedral_group"}
