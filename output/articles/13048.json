{"title":"Radonifying function","summary":"In measure theory, a radonifying function (ultimately named after Johann Radon) between measurable spaces is one that takes a cylinder set measure (CSM) on the first space to a true measure on the second space. It acquired its name because the pushforward measure on the second space was historically thought of as a Radon measure.","image":"4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b.svg","url":"Radonifying_function"}
