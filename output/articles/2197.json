{"title":"Cantor's isomorphism theorem","summary":"In order theory and model theory, branches of mathematics, Cantor's isomorphism theorem states that every two countable dense unbounded linear orders are order-isomorphic. For instance, Minkowski's question-mark function produces an isomorphism (a one-to-one order-preserving correspondence) between the numerical ordering of the rational numbers and the numerical ordering of the dyadic rationals.","image":"Minkowski_question_mark.svg.png.webp","url":"Cantor's_isomorphism_theorem"}
