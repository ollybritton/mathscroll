{"title":"Order convergence","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, a filter F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} in an order complete vector lattice X {\\displaystyle X} is order convergent if it contains an order bounded subset (that is, is contained in an interval of the form [ a , b ] := { x ∈ X : a ≤ x and x ≤ b } {\\displaystyle [a,b]:=\\{x\\in X:a\\leq x{\\text{ and }}x\\leq b\\}} ) and if F , {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}},}","image":"205d4b91000d9dcf1a5bbabdfa6a8395fa60b676.svg","url":"Order_convergence"}
