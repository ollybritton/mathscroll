{"title":"Sorting number","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, the sorting numbers are a sequence of numbers introduced in 1950 by Hugo Steinhaus for the analysis of comparison sort algorithms. These numbers give the worst-case number of comparisons used by both binary insertion sort and merge sort. However, there are other algorithms that use fewer comparisons.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Sorting_number"}
