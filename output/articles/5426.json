{"title":"Final stellation of the icosahedron","summary":"In geometry, the complete or final stellation of the icosahedron[1][2] is the outermost stellation of the icosahedron, and is \"complete\" and \"final\" because it includes all of the cells in the icosahedron's stellation diagram. That is, every three intersecting face planes of the icosahedral core intersect either on a vertex of this polyhedron, or inside of it.","image":"Complete_icosahedron_ortho_stella.png.webp","url":"Final_stellation_of_the_icosahedron"}
