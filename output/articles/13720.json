{"title":"Rotation formalisms in three dimensions","summary":"In geometry, various formalisms exist to express a rotation in three dimensions as a mathematical transformation. In physics, this concept is applied to classical mechanics where rotational (or angular) kinematics is the science of quantitative description of a purely rotational motion. The orientation of an object at a given instant is described with the same tools, as it is defined as an imaginary rotation from a reference placement in space, rather than an actually observed rotation from a previous placement in space.","image":"b69c2ada3fa0502ac68efb4431455d13ba2d7bd2.svg","url":"Rotation_formalisms_in_three_dimensions"}
