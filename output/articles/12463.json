{"title":"Preradical","summary":"In mathematics, a preradical is a subfunctor of the identity functor in the category of left modules over a ring with identity. The class of all preradicals over R-mod is denoted by R-pr. There is a natural order in R-pr given by, for any two preradicals σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } and τ {\\displaystyle \\tau } , σ ≤ τ {\\displaystyle \\sigma \\leq \\tau } , if for any left R-module M, σ M ≤ τ M {\\displaystyle \\sigma M\\leq \\tau M} . With this order R-pr becomes a big lattice.","image":"59f59b7c3e6fdb1d0365a494b81fb9a696138c36.svg","url":"Preradical"}
