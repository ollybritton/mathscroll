{"title":"Angles between flats","summary":"The concept of angles between lines in the plane and between pairs of two lines, two planes or a line and a plane in space can be generalized to arbitrary dimension. This generalization was first discussed by Jordan.[1] For any pair of flats in a Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension one can define a set of mutual angles which are invariant under isometric transformation of the Euclidean space. If the flats do not intersect, their shortest distance is one more invariant.[1] These angles are called canonical[2] or principal.[3] The concept of angles can be generalized to pairs of flats in a finite-dimensional inner product space over the complex numbers.","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"Angles_between_flats"}
