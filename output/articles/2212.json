{"title":"Caratheodory-π solution","summary":"A Carathéodory-π solution is a generalized solution to an ordinary differential equation. The concept is due to I. Michael Ross  and named in honor of Constantin Carathéodory.[1]  Its practicality was demonstrated in 2008 by Ross et al.[2]  in a laboratory implementation of the concept. The concept is most useful for implementing feedback controls, particularly those generated by an application of Ross' pseudospectral optimal control theory.[3]","image":"a48c6eff193fa5c7ff114764726b9425d00f319b.svg","url":"Caratheodory-π_solution"}
