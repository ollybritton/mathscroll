{"title":"Divided power structure","summary":"In mathematics, specifically commutative algebra, a divided power structure is a way of making expressions of the form x n / n ! {\\displaystyle x^{n}/n!} meaningful even when it is not possible to actually divide by n ! {\\displaystyle n!} .","image":"eb29d665ac710c4251fd365a7bf70c02162a0db2.svg","url":"Divided_power_structure"}
