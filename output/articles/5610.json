{"title":"Fourier analysis","summary":"In mathematics, Fourier analysis (/ˈfʊrieɪ, -iər/)[1] is the study of the way general functions may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler trigonometric functions. Fourier analysis grew from the study of Fourier series, and is named after Joseph Fourier, who showed that representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of heat transfer.","image":"Bass_Guitar_Time_Signal_of_open_string_A_note_(55_Hz).png.webp","url":"Fourier_analysis"}
