{"title":"Monomial basis","summary":"In mathematics the monomial basis of a polynomial ring is its basis (as a vector space or free module over the field or ring of coefficients) that consists of all monomials. The monomials form a basis because every polynomial may be uniquely written as a finite linear combination of monomials (this is an immediate consequence of the definition of a polynomial).","image":"db592780a2a4ae86f4f12e7894d4e75381323bfc.svg","url":"Monomial_basis"}
