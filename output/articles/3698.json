{"title":"Cyclohedron","summary":"In geometry, the cyclohedron is a d {\\displaystyle d} -dimensional polytope where d {\\displaystyle d} can be any non-negative integer. It was first introduced as a combinatorial object by Raoul Bott and Clifford Taubes[1] and, for this reason, it is also sometimes called the Bottâ€“Taubes polytope. It was later constructed as a polytope by Martin Markl[2] and by Rodica Simion.[3] Rodica Simion describes this polytope as an associahedron of type B.","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Cyclohedron"}
