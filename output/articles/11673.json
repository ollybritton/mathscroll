{"title":"p-Laplacian","summary":"In mathematics, the p-Laplacian, or the p-Laplace operator, is a quasilinear elliptic partial differential operator of 2nd order. It is a nonlinear generalization of the Laplace operator, where p {\\displaystyle p} is allowed to range over 1 < p < âˆž {\\displaystyle 1<p<\\infty } .
