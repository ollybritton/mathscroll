{"title":"Grothendieck category","summary":"In mathematics, a Grothendieck category is a certain kind of abelian category, introduced in Alexander Grothendieck's TÃ´hoku paper of 1957[1] in order to develop the machinery of homological algebra for modules and for sheaves in a unified manner. The theory of these categories was further developed in Pierre Gabriel's seminal thesis in 1962.[2]","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Grothendieck_category"}
