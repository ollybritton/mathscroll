{"title":"Hardy hierarchy","summary":"In computability theory, computational complexity theory and proof theory, the Hardy hierarchy, named after G. H. Hardy, is a hierarchy of sets of numerical functions generated from an ordinal-indexed family of functions hα: N → N (where N is the set of natural numbers, {0, 1, ...}) called Hardy functions. It is related to the fast-growing hierarchy and slow-growing hierarchy.","image":"78c211ce8badf4ffbf9417ecceb0ef7ab0a8caed.svg","url":"Hardy_hierarchy"}
