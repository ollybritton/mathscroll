{"title":"Orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra","summary":"In mathematics, an orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra is a pair ( g , s ) {\\displaystyle ({\\mathfrak {g}},s)} consisting of a real Lie algebra g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} and an automorphism s {\\displaystyle s} of g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} of order 2 {\\displaystyle 2} such that the eigenspace u {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {u}}} of s corresponding to 1 (i.e., the set u {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {u}}} of fixed points) is a compact subalgebra. If \"compactness\" is omitted, it is called a symmetric Lie algebra. An orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra is said to be effective if u {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {u}}} intersects the center of g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} trivially. In practice, effectiveness is often assumed; we do this in this article as well.","image":"cc7ed6538a442841db565f09a48e551a6e7f8616.svg","url":"Orthogonal_symmetric_Lie_algebra"}
