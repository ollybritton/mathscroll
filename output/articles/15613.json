{"title":"Tetrahedral-triangular tiling honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the tetrahedral-triangular tiling honeycomb is a paracompact uniform honeycomb, constructed from triangular tiling, tetrahedron, and octahedron cells, in an icosidodecahedron vertex figure. It has a single-ring Coxeter diagram, , and is named by its two regular cells.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Tetrahedral-triangular_tiling_honeycomb"}
