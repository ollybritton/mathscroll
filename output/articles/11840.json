{"title":"Partial least squares regression","summary":"Partial least squares regression (PLS regression) is a statistical method that bears some relation to principal components regression; instead of finding hyperplanes of maximum variance between the response and independent variables, it finds a linear regression model by projecting the predicted variables and the observable variables to a new space. Because both the X and Y data are projected to new spaces, the PLS family of methods are known as bilinear factor models. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is a variant used when the Y is categorical.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Partial_least_squares_regression"}
