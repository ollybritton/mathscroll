{"title":"PP (complexity)","summary":"In complexity theory, PP is the class of decision problems solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time, with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all instances. The abbreviation PP refers to probabilistic polynomial time. The complexity class was defined[1] by Gill in 1977.","image":"Randomised_Complexity_Classes_2.svg.png.webp","url":"PP_(complexity)"}
