{"title":"Marion Tinsley","summary":"Marion Franklin Tinsley (February 3, 1927 – April 3, 1995) was an American mathematician and checkers player. He is considered to be the greatest checkers player who ever lived.[1] Tinsley was world champion 1955–1958 and 1975–1991 and never lost a world championship match, and lost only seven games (two of them to the Chinook computer program, one of them drunk, one of them in a simultaneous exhibition)[2] from 1950 until his death in 1995.[3] He withdrew from championship play during the years 1958–1975, relinquishing the title during that time.  Derek Oldbury, sometimes considered the second-best player of all time, thought that Tinsley was \"to checkers what Leonardo da Vinci was to science, what Michelangelo was to art and what Beethoven was to music.\"[4]","image":"Marion_Tinsley.jpg.webp","url":"Marion_Tinsley"}
