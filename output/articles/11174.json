{"title":"Noncrossing partition","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, the topic of noncrossing partitions has assumed some importance because of (among other things) its application to the theory of free probability. The number of noncrossing partitions of a set of n elements is the nth Catalan number. The number of noncrossing partitions of an n-element set with k blocks is found in the Narayana number triangle.","image":"Noncrossing_partitions_5.svg.png.webp","url":"Noncrossing_partition"}
