{"title":"Ringing (signal)","summary":"In electronics, signal processing, and video, ringing is oscillation of a signal, particularly in the step response (the response to a sudden change in input). Often ringing is undesirable, but not always, as in the case of resonant inductive coupling. It is also known as hunting.[1] It is closely related to overshoot, often instigated as damping response following overshoot or undershoot, and thus the terms are at times conflated.","image":"High_accuracy_settling_time_measurements_figure_1.png.webp","url":"Ringing_(signal)"}
