{"title":"Complex analytic variety","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular differential geometry and complex geometry, a complex analytic variety [note 1]  or complex analytic space is a generalization of a complex manifold which allows the presence of singularities. Complex analytic varieties are locally ringed spaces which are locally isomorphic to local model spaces, where a local model space is an open subset of the vanishing locus of a finite set of holomorphic functions.","image":"f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7.svg","url":"Complex_analytic_variety"}
