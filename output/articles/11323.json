{"title":"Occupancy grid mapping","summary":"Occupancy Grid Mapping refers to a family of computer algorithms in probabilistic robotics for mobile robots which address the problem of generating maps from noisy and uncertain sensor measurement data, with the assumption that the robot pose is known. Occupancy grids were first proposed by H. Moravec and A. Elfes in 1985.[1]","image":"38a84d58bb326df8b4383c32361bd25d2fa66a30.svg","url":"Occupancy_grid_mapping"}
