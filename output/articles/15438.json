{"title":"Szpilrajn extension theorem","summary":"In order theory, the Szpilrajn extension theorem (also called the order-extension principle), proved by Edward Szpilrajn in 1930,[1] states that every partial order is contained in a total order. Intuitively, the theorem says that any method of comparing elements that leaves some pairs incomparable can be extended in such a way that every pair becomes comparable. The theorem is one of many examples of the use of the axiom of choice in the form of Zorn's lemma to find a maximal set with certain properties.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Szpilrajn_extension_theorem"}
