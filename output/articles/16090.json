{"title":"Triple product rule","summary":"The triple product rule, known variously as the cyclic chain rule, cyclic relation, cyclical rule or Euler's chain rule, is a formula which relates partial derivatives of three interdependent variables.  The rule finds application in thermodynamics, where frequently three variables can be related by a function of the form f(x, y, z) = 0, so each variable is given as an implicit function of the other two variables.  For example, an equation of state for a fluid relates temperature, pressure, and volume in this manner.  The triple product rule for such interrelated variables x, y, and z comes from using a reciprocity relation on the result of the implicit function theorem, and is given by","image":"33cbb37df638b6d3377c6875505c397c756d4895.svg","url":"Triple_product_rule"}
