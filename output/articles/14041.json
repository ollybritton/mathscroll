{"title":"Second-countable space","summary":"In topology, a second-countable space, also called a completely separable space, is a topological space whose topology has a countable base. More explicitly, a topological space T {\\displaystyle T} is second-countable if there exists some countable collection U = { U i } i = 1 âˆž {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {U}}=\\{U_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty }} of open subsets of T {\\displaystyle T} such that any open subset of T {\\displaystyle T} can be written as a union of elements of some subfamily of U {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {U}}} . A second-countable space is said to satisfy the second axiom of countability. Like other countability axioms, the property of being second-countable restricts the number of open sets that a space can have.","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Second-countable_space"}
