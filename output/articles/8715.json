{"title":"Kirkpatrick–Seidel algorithm","summary":"The Kirkpatrick–Seidel algorithm, proposed by its authors as a potential \"ultimate planar convex hull algorithm\", is an algorithm for computing the convex hull of a set of points in the plane, with O ( n log ⁡ h ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}(n\\log h)} time complexity, where n {\\displaystyle n} is the number of input points and h {\\displaystyle h} is the number of points (non dominated or maximal points, as called in some texts) in the hull. Thus, the algorithm is output-sensitive: its running time depends on both the input size and the output size. Another output-sensitive algorithm, the gift wrapping algorithm, was known much earlier, but the Kirkpatrick–Seidel algorithm has an asymptotic running time that is significantly smaller and that always improves on the O ( n log ⁡ n ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}(n\\log n)} bounds of non-output-sensitive algorithms. The Kirkpatrick–Seidel algorithm is named after its inventors, David G. Kirkpatrick and Raimund Seidel.[1]","image":"a9470a317308c81039cf1f67c67273fee318e81d.svg","url":"Kirkpatrick–Seidel_algorithm"}
