{"title":"ω-automaton","summary":"In automata theory, a branch of theoretical computer science, an ω-automaton (or stream automaton) is a variation of finite automata that runs on infinite, rather than finite, strings as input. Since ω-automata do not stop, they have a variety of acceptance conditions rather than simply a set of accepting states.","image":"Buchi_non_deterministic_example.svg.png.webp","url":"Ω-automaton"}
