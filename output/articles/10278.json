{"title":"Medial icosacronic hexecontahedron","summary":"In geometry, the medial icosacronic hexecontahedron (or midly sagittal ditriacontahedron) is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron. It is the dual of the uniform icosidodecadodecahedron. Its faces are darts. Part of each dart lies inside the solid, hence is invisible in solid models.","image":"DU44_medial_icosacronic_hexecontahedron.png.webp","url":"Medial_icosacronic_hexecontahedron"}
