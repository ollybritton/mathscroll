{"title":"Applied element method","summary":"The applied element method (AEM) is a numerical analysis used in predicting the continuum and discrete behavior of structures.  The modeling method in AEM adopts the concept of discrete cracking allowing it to automatically track structural collapse behavior passing through all stages of loading: elastic, crack initiation and propagation in tension-weak materials, reinforcement yield, element separation, element contact and collision, as well as collision with the ground and adjacent structures.","image":"1ef5b7f21d3c74c3f528a8c7254e8fbf8d2e27d5.svg","url":"Applied_element_method"}
