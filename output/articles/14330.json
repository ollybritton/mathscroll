{"title":"Siegel modular form","summary":"In mathematics, Siegel modular forms are a major type of automorphic form. These generalize conventional elliptic modular forms which are closely related to elliptic curves. The complex manifolds constructed in the theory of Siegel modular forms are Siegel modular varieties, which are basic models for what a moduli space for abelian varieties (with some extra level structure) should be and are constructed as quotients of the Siegel upper half-space rather than the upper half-plane by discrete groups.","image":"bbfea1bd678909a322e644d6f9726958de6a2a1a.svg","url":"Siegel_modular_form"}
