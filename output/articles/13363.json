{"title":"Relatively hyperbolic group","summary":"In mathematics, the concept of a relatively hyperbolic group is an important generalization of  the geometric group theory concept of a hyperbolic group. The motivating examples of relatively hyperbolic groups are the fundamental groups of complete noncompact hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume.","image":"6fbccc6c0d2e5a67b020232accf233da651c7530.svg","url":"Relatively_hyperbolic_group"}
