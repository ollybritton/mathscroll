{"title":"Perfect digit-to-digit invariant","summary":"In number theory, a perfect digit-to-digit invariant (PDDI; also known as a Munchausen number[1]) is a natural number in a given number base b {\\displaystyle b} that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of itself. An example in base 10 is 3435, because 3435 = 3 3 + 4 4 + 3 3 + 5 5 {\\displaystyle 3435=3^{3}+4^{4}+3^{3}+5^{5}} . The term \"Munchausen number\" was coined by Dutch mathematician and software engineer Daan van Berkel in 2009,[2] as this evokes the story of Baron Munchausen raising himself up by his own ponytail because each digit is raised to the power of itself.[3][4]","image":"f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3.svg","url":"Perfect_digit-to-digit_invariant"}
