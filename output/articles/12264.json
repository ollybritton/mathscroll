{"title":"Pointwise","summary":"In mathematics, the qualifier pointwise is used to indicate that a certain property is defined by considering each value f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} of some function f . {\\displaystyle f.} An important class of pointwise concepts are the pointwise operations, that is, operations defined on functions by applying the operations to function values separately for each point in the domain of definition. Important relations can also be defined pointwise.","image":"202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074.svg","url":"Pointwise"}
