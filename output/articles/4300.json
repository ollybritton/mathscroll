{"title":"Distance from a point to a line","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, the distance from a point to a line is the shortest distance from a given point to any point on an infinite straight line. It is the perpendicular distance of the point to the line, the length of the line segment which joins the point to nearest point on the line. The formula for calculating it can be derived and expressed in several ways.","image":"baff35b2a747a59d5a113dcabea8fda7d2c09288.svg","url":"Distance_from_a_point_to_a_line"}
