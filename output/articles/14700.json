{"title":"Spaces of test functions and distributions","summary":"In mathematical analysis, the spaces of test functions and distributions are topological vector spaces (TVSs) that are used in the definition and application of distributions. Test functions are usually infinitely differentiable complex-valued (or sometimes real-valued) functions on a non-empty open subset U ⊆ R n {\\displaystyle U\\subseteq \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} that have compact support. The space of all test functions, denoted by C c ∞ ( U ) , {\\displaystyle C_{c}^{\\infty }(U),} is endowed with a certain topology, called the canonical LF-topology, that makes C c ∞ ( U ) {\\displaystyle C_{c}^{\\infty }(U)} into a complete Hausdorff locally convex TVS. The strong dual space of C c ∞ ( U ) {\\displaystyle C_{c}^{\\infty }(U)} is called the space of distributions on U {\\displaystyle U} and is denoted by D ′ ( U ) := ( C c ∞ ( U ) ) b ′ , {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {D}}^{\\prime }(U):=\\left(C_{c}^{\\infty }(U)\\right)_{b}^{\\prime },} where the \" b {\\displaystyle b} \" subscript indicates that the continuous dual space of C c ∞ ( U ) , {\\displaystyle C_{c}^{\\infty }(U),} denoted by ( C c ∞ ( U ) ) ′ , {\\displaystyle \\left(C_{c}^{\\infty }(U)\\right)^{\\prime },} is endowed with the strong dual topology.","image":"1a4ffabb41c43db92055a8fd5be74cd7633756a9.svg","url":"Spaces_of_test_functions_and_distributions"}
