{"title":"♯P-completeness of 01-permanent","summary":"The #P-completeness of 01-permanent, sometimes known as Valiant's theorem,[1] is a mathematical proof about the permanent of matrices, considered a seminal result in computational complexity theory.[2][3] In a 1979 scholarly paper, Leslie Valiant proved that the computational problem of computing the permanent of a matrix is #P-hard, even if the matrix is restricted to have entries that are all 0 or 1.[4] In this restricted case, computing the permanent is even #P-complete, because it corresponds to the #P problem of counting the number of permutation matrices one can get by changing ones into zeroes.","image":"296ad42d9541f8285979ce822ccb661da56111ca.svg","url":"♯P-completeness_of_01-permanent"}
