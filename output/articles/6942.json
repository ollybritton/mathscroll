{"title":"Hasse–Arf theorem","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in local class field theory, the Hasse–Arf theorem is a result concerning jumps of the upper numbering filtration of the Galois group of a finite Galois extension.  A special case of it when the residue fields are finite  was originally proved by Helmut Hasse,[1][2] and the general result was proved by Cahit Arf.[3][4]","image":"3613c93df8a9abea2c7c01f060435f690178f4b2.svg","url":"Hasse–Arf_theorem"}
