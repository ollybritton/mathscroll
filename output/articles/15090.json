{"title":"Stochastic matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a stochastic matrix is a square matrix used to describe the transitions of a Markov chain.  Each of its entries is a nonnegative real number representing a probability.[1][2]: 9–11    It is also called a probability matrix, transition matrix, substitution matrix, or Markov matrix.[2]: 9–11  The stochastic matrix was first developed by Andrey Markov at the beginning of the 20th century, and has found use throughout a wide variety of scientific fields, including probability theory, statistics, mathematical finance and linear algebra, as well as computer science and population genetics.[2]: 1–8  There are several different definitions and types of stochastic matrices:[2]: 9–11","image":"6aa331abdd3ac36cb99a5b04b5480c007d63f2aa.svg","url":"Stochastic_matrix"}
