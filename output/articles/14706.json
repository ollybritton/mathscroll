{"title":"Spark (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in linear algebra, the spark of a m Ã— n {\\displaystyle m\\times n} matrix A {\\displaystyle A} is the smallest integer k {\\displaystyle k} such that there exists a set of k {\\displaystyle k} columns in A {\\displaystyle A} which are linearly dependent. If all the columns are linearly independent, s p a r k ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {spark} (A)} is usually defined to be 1 more than the number of rows. The concept of matrix spark finds applications in error-correction codes, compressive sensing, and matroid theory, and provides a simple criterion for maximal sparsity of solutions to a system of linear equations.","image":"12b23d207d23dd430b93320539abbb0bde84870d.svg","url":"Spark_(mathematics)"}
