{"title":"Polar factorization theorem","summary":"In optimal transport, a branch of mathematics, polar factorization of vector fields is a basic result due to Brenier (1987),[1] with antecedents of Knott-Smith (1984)[2] and Rachev (1985),[3] that generalizes many existing results among which are the polar decomposition of real matrices, and the rearrangement of real-valued functions.","image":"1490891def2fafd2744f48276c436090478d2805.svg","url":"Polar_factorization_theorem"}
