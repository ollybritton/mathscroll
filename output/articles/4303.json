{"title":"Distance sampling","summary":"Distance sampling is a widely used group of closely related methods for estimating the density and/or abundance of populations. The main methods are based on line transects or point transects.[1][2] In this method of sampling, the data collected are the distances of the objects being surveyed from these randomly placed lines or points, and the objective is to estimate the average density of the objects within a region.[3]","image":"Distance_sampling_method_line_transects_diagram.png.webp","url":"Distance_sampling"}
