{"title":"List of representations of e","summary":"The mathematical constant e can be represented in a variety of ways as a real number.  Since e is an irrational number (see proof that e is irrational), it cannot be represented as the quotient of two integers, but it can be represented as a continued fraction.  Using calculus, e may also be represented as an infinite series, infinite product, or other types of limit of a sequence.","image":"Euler's_formula.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_representations_of_e"}
