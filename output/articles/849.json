{"title":"Anomalous cancellation","summary":"An anomalous cancellation or accidental cancellation is a particular kind of arithmetic procedural error that gives a numerically correct answer. An attempt is made to reduce a fraction by cancelling individual digits in the numerator and denominator. This is not a legitimate operation, and does not in general give a correct answer, but in some rare cases the result is numerically the same as if a correct procedure had been applied.[1] The trivial cases of cancelling trailing zeros or where all of the digits are equal are ignored.","image":"e7ecc1379f32c4bd2d66842744bace91c4304852.svg","url":"Anomalous_cancellation"}
