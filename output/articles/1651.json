{"title":"Binary tiling","summary":"In geometry, the binary tiling (sometimes called the Böröczky tiling)[1] is a tiling of the hyperbolic plane, resembling a quadtree over the Poincaré half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane. It was first studied mathematically in 1974 by Károly Böröczky.[2][3][4] However, a closely related tiling was used earlier in a 1957 print by M. C. Escher.[5]","image":"Binary_Tiling.png.webp","url":"Binary_tiling"}
