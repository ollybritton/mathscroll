{"title":"Eigenvalue perturbation","summary":"In mathematics, an eigenvalue perturbation problem is that of finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a system A x = λ x {\\displaystyle Ax=\\lambda x} that is perturbed from one with known eigenvectors and eigenvalues A 0 x 0 = λ 0 x 0 {\\displaystyle A_{0}x_{0}=\\lambda _{0}x_{0}} . This is useful for studying how sensitive the original system's eigenvectors and eigenvalues x 0 i , λ 0 i , i = 1 , … n {\\displaystyle x_{0i},\\lambda _{0i},i=1,\\dots n} are to changes in the system. This type of analysis was popularized by Lord Rayleigh, in his investigation of harmonic vibrations of a string perturbed by small inhomogeneities.[1]","image":"824a9eaa5f30f9714cf5ce8b765589a7ebaee6df.svg","url":"Eigenvalue_perturbation"}
