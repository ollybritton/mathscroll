{"title":"Axiomatic foundations of topological spaces","summary":"In the mathematical field of topology, a topological space is usually defined by declaring its open sets.[1] However, this is not necessary, as there are many equivalent axiomatic foundations, each leading to exactly the same concept. For instance, a topological space determines a class of closed sets, of closure and interior operators, and of convergence of various types of objects. Each of these can instead be taken as the primary class of objects, with all of the others (including the class of open sets) directly determined from that new starting point. For example, in Kazimierz Kuratowski's well-known textbook on point-set topology, a topological space is defined as a set together with a certain type of \"closure operator,\" and all other concepts are derived therefrom.[2] Likewise, the neighborhood-based axioms (in the context of Hausdorff spaces) can be retraced to Felix Hausdorff's original definition of a topological space in Grundz√ºge der Mengenlehre.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Axiomatic_foundations_of_topological_spaces"}
