{"title":"Favard's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Favard's theorem, also called the Shohat–Favard theorem,  states that a sequence of  polynomials satisfying a suitable 3-term recurrence relation  is a sequence of orthogonal polynomials. The theorem was introduced in the theory of orthogonal polynomials  by Favard (1935) and Shohat (1938), though essentially the same theorem was used by Stieltjes in the theory of  continued fractions  many years before Favard's paper, and was rediscovered several times by other authors before Favard's work.","image":"864740814253ad975c6628d1f3dd2e541ff8e9ec.svg","url":"Favard's_theorem"}
