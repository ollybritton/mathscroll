{"title":"Angle of parallelism","summary":"In hyperbolic geometry, the angle of parallelism Î  ( a ) {\\displaystyle \\Pi (a)} , is the angle at the non-right angle vertex of a right hyperbolic triangle having two asymptotic parallel sides. The angle depends on the segment length a between the right angle and the vertex of the angle of parallelism.","image":"c672b4f3cc9c843cfef64aee7604a5f53b89d4c8.svg","url":"Angle_of_parallelism"}
