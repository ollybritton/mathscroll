{"title":"Binomial series","summary":"In mathematics, the binomial series is a generalization of the polynomial that comes from a binomial formula expression like ( 1 + x ) n {\\displaystyle (1+x)^{n}} for a nonnegative integer n {\\displaystyle n} .  Specifically, the binomial series is the Taylor series for the function f ( x ) = ( 1 + x ) α {\\displaystyle f(x)=(1+x)^{\\alpha }} centered at x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0} , where α ∈ C {\\displaystyle \\alpha \\in \\mathbb {C} } and | x | < 1 {\\displaystyle |x|<1} .
