{"title":"Unit hyperbola","summary":"In geometry, the unit hyperbola is the set of points (x,y) in the Cartesian plane that satisfy the implicit equation x 2 âˆ’ y 2 = 1. {\\displaystyle x^{2}-y^{2}=1.} In the study of indefinite orthogonal groups, the unit hyperbola forms the basis for an alternative radial length","image":"24f2ba746546937e0027e7cebcae383f226c6125.svg","url":"Unit_hyperbola"}
