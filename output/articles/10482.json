{"title":"Minimal-entropy martingale measure","summary":"In probability theory, the minimal-entropy martingale measure (MEMM) is the risk-neutral probability measure that minimises the entropy difference between the objective probability measure, P {\\displaystyle P} , and the risk-neutral measure, Q {\\displaystyle Q} . In incomplete markets, this is one way of choosing a risk-neutral measure (from the infinite number available) so as to still maintain the no-arbitrage conditions.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Minimal-entropy_martingale_measure"}
