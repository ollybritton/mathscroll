{"title":"Space form","summary":"In mathematics, a space form is a complete Riemannian manifold M of constant sectional curvature K. The three most fundamental examples are Euclidean n-space, the n-dimensional sphere, and hyperbolic space, although a space form need not be simply connected.","image":"655dc6ee87dfc8866fb4adaa13ed2eb37f519a1d.svg","url":"Space_form"}
