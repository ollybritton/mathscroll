{"title":"Rank-maximal allocation","summary":"Rank-maximal (RM) allocation is a rule for fair division of indivisible items. Suppose we have to allocate some items among people. Each person can rank the items from best to worst. The RM rule says that we have to give as many people as possible their best (#1) item. Subject to that, we have to give as many people as possible their next-best (#2) item, and so on.","image":"6f1353709389d2c880ac7750bda34d67fc86b4c6.svg","url":"Rank-maximal_allocation"}
