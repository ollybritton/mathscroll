{"title":"Bel decomposition","summary":"In semi-Riemannian geometry, the Bel decomposition, taken with respect to a specific timelike congruence, is a way of breaking up the Riemann tensor of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold into lower order tensors with properties similar to the electric field and magnetic field.  Such a decomposition was partially described by Alphonse Matte in 1953[1] and by Lluis Bel in 1958.[2]","image":"5dc35b5a0226cf11a2c3f2d2dbbac6ab5ade6036.svg","url":"Bel_decomposition"}
