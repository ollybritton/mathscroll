{"title":"Bayesian quadrature","summary":"Bayesian quadrature[1][2][3][4][5] is a method for approximating intractable integration problems. It falls within the class of probabilistic numerical methods. Bayesian quadrature views numerical integration as a Bayesian inference task, where function evaluations are used to estimate the integral of that function. For this reason, it is sometimes also referred to as \"Bayesian probabilistic numerical integration\" or \"Bayesian numerical integration\".  The name \"Bayesian cubature\" is also sometimes used when the integrand is multi-dimensional.  A potential advantage of this approach is that it provides probabilistic uncertainty quantification for the value of the integral.","image":"c54b32c9d52e11d1db816a14b97a2a01cdf2a71f.svg","url":"Bayesian_quadrature"}
