{"title":"Andreotti–Frankel theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Andreotti–Frankel theorem, introduced by Aldo Andreotti and Theodore Frankel (1959), states that if V {\\displaystyle V} is a smooth, complex affine variety of complex dimension n {\\displaystyle n} or, more generally, if V {\\displaystyle V} is any Stein manifold of dimension n {\\displaystyle n} , then V {\\displaystyle V} admits a Morse function with critical points of index at most n, and so V {\\displaystyle V} is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex of real dimension at most n.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Andreotti–Frankel_theorem"}
