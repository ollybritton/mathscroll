{"title":"Stress resultants","summary":"Stress resultants are simplified representations of the stress state in structural elements such as beams, plates, or shells.[1]  The geometry of typical structural elements allows the internal stress state to be simplified because of the existence of a \"thickness'\" direction in which the size of the element is much smaller than in other directions.  As a consequence the three traction components that vary from point to point in a cross-section can be replaced with a set of resultant forces and resultant moments.  These are the stress resultants (also called membrane forces, shear forces, and bending moment) that may be used to determine the detailed stress state in the structural element.   A three-dimensional problem can then be reduced to a one-dimensional problem (for beams) or a two-dimensional problem (for plates and shells).","image":"Components_stress_tensor_cartesian.svg.png.webp","url":"Stress_resultants"}
