{"title":"Brane","summary":"In string theory and related theories such as supergravity theories, a brane is a physical object that generalizes the notion of a point particle to higher dimensions. Branes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according to the rules of quantum mechanics. They have mass and can have other attributes such as charge.","image":"Calabi_yau_formatted.svg.png.webp","url":"Brane"}
