{"title":"ε-quadratic form","summary":"In mathematics, specifically the theory of quadratic forms, an ε-quadratic form is a generalization of quadratic forms to skew-symmetric settings and to *-rings; ε = ±1, accordingly for symmetric or skew-symmetric. They are also called ( − ) n {\\displaystyle (-)^{n}} -quadratic forms, particularly in the context of surgery theory.","image":"efb06f9819c13d126ee8e54164b25308385b1bf4.svg","url":"Ε-quadratic_form"}
