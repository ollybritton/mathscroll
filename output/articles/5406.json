{"title":"Field of sets","summary":"In mathematics, a field of sets is a mathematical structure consisting of a pair ( X , F ) {\\displaystyle (X,{\\mathcal {F}})} consisting of a set X {\\displaystyle X} and a family F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} of subsets of X {\\displaystyle X} called an algebra over X {\\displaystyle X} that contains the empty set as an element, and is closed under the operations of taking complements in X , {\\displaystyle X,} finite unions, and finite intersections.","image":"9747bc31b2b0eaac96b8af052f44d1791a34ca9b.svg","url":"Field_of_sets"}
