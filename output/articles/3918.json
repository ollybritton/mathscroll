{"title":"Delaporte distribution","summary":"The Delaporte distribution is a discrete probability distribution that has received attention in actuarial science.[1][2] It can be defined using the convolution of a negative binomial distribution with a Poisson distribution.[2] Just as the negative binomial distribution can be viewed as a Poisson distribution where the mean parameter is itself a random variable with a gamma distribution, the Delaporte distribution can be viewed as a compound distribution based on a Poisson distribution, where there are two components to the mean parameter: a fixed component, which has the λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } parameter, and a gamma-distributed variable component, which has the α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } and β {\\displaystyle \\beta } parameters.[3] The distribution is named for Pierre Delaporte, who analyzed it in relation to automobile accident claim counts in 1959,[4] although it appeared in a different form as early as 1934 in a paper by Rolf von Lüders,[5] where it was called the Formel II distribution.[2]","image":"b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a.svg","url":"Delaporte_distribution"}
