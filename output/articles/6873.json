{"title":"Hantzsche–Wendt manifold","summary":"The Hantzsche–Wendt manifold, also known as the HW manifold or didicosm,[1] is a compact, orientable, flat 3-manifold, first studied by Walter Hantzsche and Hilmar Wendt in 1934.[2] It is the only closed flat 3-manifold with first Betti number zero. Its holonomy group is Z 2 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} _{2}^{2}} .[3] It has been suggested as a possible shape of the universe because its complicated geometry can obscure the features in the cosmic microwave background that would arise if the universe is a closed flat manifold, such as the 3-torus.[4]","image":"f86cdebd065ce715185fea5e604557ac15453826.svg","url":"Hantzsche–Wendt_manifold"}
