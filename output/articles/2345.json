{"title":"Category of topological vector spaces","summary":"In mathematics, the category of topological vector spaces is the category whose objects are topological vector spaces and whose morphisms are continuous linear maps between them. This is a category because the composition of two continuous linear maps is again a continuous linear map.  The category is often denoted TVect or TVS.","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Category_of_topological_vector_spaces"}
