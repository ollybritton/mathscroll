{"title":"Frege system","summary":"In proof complexity, a Frege system is a propositional proof system whose proofs are sequences of formulas derived using a finite set of sound and implicationally complete inference rules. Frege systems (more often known as Hilbert systems in general proof theory) are named after Gottlob Frege.","image":"33592ef818259f787d9ef83c8fa1da9295be2875.svg","url":"Frege_system"}
