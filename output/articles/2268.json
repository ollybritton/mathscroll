{"title":"Carpet plot","summary":"A carpet plot is any of a few different specific types of plot. The more common plot referred to as a carpet plot is one that illustrates the interaction between two or more independent variables and one or more dependent variables in a two-dimensional plot. Besides the ability to incorporate more variables, another feature that distinguishes a carpet plot from an equivalent contour plot or 3D surface plot is that a carpet plot can be used to more accurately interpolate data points. A conventional carpet plot can capture the interaction of up to three independent variables and three dependent variables and still be easily read and interpolated.","image":"Cheater_plot_aligned.svg.png.webp","url":"Carpet_plot"}
