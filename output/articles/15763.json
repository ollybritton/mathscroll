{"title":"Threshold theorem","summary":"In quantum computing, the threshold theorem (or quantum fault-tolerance theorem) states that a quantum computer with a physical error rate below a certain threshold can, through application of quantum error correction schemes, suppress the logical error rate to arbitrarily low levels. This shows that quantum computers can be made fault-tolerant, as an analogue to von Neumann's threshold theorem for classical computation.[1] This result was proven (for various error models) by the groups of Dorit Aharanov and Michael Ben-Or;[2] Emanuel Knill, Raymond Laflamme, and Wojciech Zurek;[3] and Alexei Kitaev[4] independently.[3] These results built off a paper of Peter Shor,[5] which proved a weaker version of the threshold theorem.","image":"cceec7e283759a14f6c7cb49bab7c80f1133c6e8.svg","url":"Threshold_theorem"}
