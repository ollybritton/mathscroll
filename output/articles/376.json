{"title":"Adequate equivalence relation","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics, an adequate equivalence relation is an equivalence relation on algebraic cycles of smooth projective varieties used to obtain a well-working theory of such cycles, and in particular, well-defined intersection products. Pierre Samuel formalized the concept of an adequate equivalence relation in 1958.[1] Since then it has become central to theory of motives. For every adequate equivalence relation, one may define the category of pure motives with respect to that relation.","image":"963fe04f458f4a7dce26ecdaa8250e0a32567600.svg","url":"Adequate_equivalence_relation"}
