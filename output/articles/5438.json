{"title":"Finite difference","summary":"A finite difference is a mathematical expression of the form f (x + b) − f (x + a). If a finite difference is divided by b − a, one gets a difference quotient. The approximation of derivatives by finite differences plays a central role in finite difference methods for the numerical solution of differential equations, especially boundary value problems.","image":"32769037c408874e1890f77554c65f39c523ebe2.svg","url":"Finite_difference"}
