{"title":"Orientation of a vector bundle","summary":"In mathematics, an orientation of a real vector bundle is a generalization of an orientation of a vector space; thus, given a real vector bundle π: E →B, an orientation of E means: for each fiber Ex, there is an orientation of the vector space Ex and one demands that each trivialization map (which is a bundle map)","image":"e9e3bb3f2ce35695e3caaea9617618928f8fd8f2.svg","url":"Orientation_of_a_vector_bundle"}
