{"title":"Radiodrome","summary":"In geometry, a radiodrome is the pursuit curve followed by a point that is pursuing another linearly-moving point. The term is derived from the Greek words ῥᾴδιος, rhā́idios, 'easier'  and δρόμος, drómos, 'running'. The classic (and best-known) form of a radiodrome is known as the \"dog curve\"; this is the path a dog follows when it swims across a stream with a current after something it has spotted on the other side. Because the dog drifts with the current, it will have to change its heading; it will also have to swim further than if it had taken the optimal heading. This case was described by Pierre Bouguer in 1732.","image":"Dog_curve.svg.png.webp","url":"Radiodrome"}
