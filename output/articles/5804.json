{"title":"Fuglede−Kadison determinant","summary":"In mathematics, the Fuglede−Kadison determinant of an invertible operator in a finite factor is a positive real number associated with it. It defines a multiplicative homomorphism from the set of invertible operators to the set of positive real numbers. The Fuglede−Kadison determinant of an operator A {\\displaystyle A} is often denoted by Δ ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\Delta (A)} .","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Fuglede−Kadison_determinant"}
