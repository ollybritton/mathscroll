{"title":"Imaginary unit","summary":"The imaginary unit or unit imaginary number (i) is a solution to the quadratic equation x 2 + 1 = 0 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+1=0} . Although there is no real number with this property, i can be used to extend the real numbers to what are called complex numbers, using addition and multiplication. A simple example of the use of i in a complex number is 2 + 3 i {\\displaystyle 2+3i} .","image":"e01c67127b28bb80e2102c934d0d01daa5c20a61.svg","url":"Imaginary_unit"}
