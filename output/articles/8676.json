{"title":"Kernel perceptron","summary":"In machine learning, the kernel perceptron is a variant of the popular perceptron learning algorithm that can learn kernel machines, i.e. non-linear classifiers that employ a kernel function to compute the similarity of unseen samples to training samples. The algorithm was invented in 1964,[1] making it the first kernel classification learner.[2]","image":"Kernel_Machine.svg.png.webp","url":"Kernel_perceptron"}
