{"title":"du Val singularity","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a Du Val singularity, also called simple surface singularity, Kleinian singularity,  or rational double point, is an isolated  singularity of a complex surface which is modeled on a double branched cover of the plane, with minimal resolution  obtained by replacing the singular point with a tree of smooth rational curves, with intersection pattern dual to a  Dynkin diagram of A-D-E singularity type. They are the canonical singularities (or, equivalently, rational Gorenstein singularities) in dimension 2. They were studied by Patrick du Val[1][2][3] and Felix Klein.","image":"6f43d6ec8a1e1fe5a85aec0dd9bdcd45ae09b06b.svg","url":"Du_Val_singularity"}
