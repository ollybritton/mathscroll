{"title":"D5 polytope","summary":"In 5-dimensional geometry, there are 23 uniform polytopes with D5 symmetry, 8 are unique, and 15 are shared with the B5 symmetry. There are two special forms, the 5-orthoplex, and 5-demicube with 10 and 16 vertices respectively.","image":"5-demicube_t0_D5.svg.png.webp","url":"D5_polytope"}
