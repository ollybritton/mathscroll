{"title":"Behrend's trace formula","summary":"In algebraic geometry, Behrend's trace formula is a generalization of the Grothendieckâ€“Lefschetz trace formula to a smooth algebraic stack over a finite field conjectured in 1993 [1] and proven in 2003 [2] by Kai Behrend. Unlike the classical one, the formula counts points in the \"stacky way\"; it takes into account the presence of nontrivial automorphisms.","image":"4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029.svg","url":"Behrend's_trace_formula"}
