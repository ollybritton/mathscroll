{"title":"Torsion group","summary":"In group theory, a branch of mathematics, a torsion group or a periodic group is a group in which every element has finite order. The exponent of such a group, if it exists, is the least common multiple of the orders of the elements.","image":"fc8154a6014b392ab6ed105f8dba37b9270423cb.svg","url":"Torsion_group"}
