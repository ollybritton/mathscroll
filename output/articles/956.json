{"title":"Area formula (geometric measure theory)","summary":"In geometric measure theory the area formula relates the Hausdorff measure of the image of a Lipschitz map, while accounting for multiplicity, to the integral of the Jacobian of the map. It is one of the fundamental results of the field that has connections, for example, to rectifiability and Sard's theorem.","image":"2206b1aa97b7b64d4bbdbd6bdfde48b0f05761d5.svg","url":"Area_formula_(geometric_measure_theory)"}
