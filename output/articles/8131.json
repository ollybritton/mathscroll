{"title":"j-line","summary":"In the study of the arithmetic of elliptic curves, the j-line over a ring R is the coarse moduli scheme attached to the moduli problem sending a ring R {\\displaystyle R} to the set of isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over R {\\displaystyle R} . Since elliptic curves over the complex numbers are isomorphic (over an algebraic closure) if and only if their j {\\displaystyle j} -invariants agree, the affine space A j 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {A} _{j}^{1}} parameterizing j-invariants of elliptic curves yields a coarse moduli space. However, this fails to be a fine moduli space due to the presence of elliptic curves with automorphisms, necessitating the construction of the Moduli stack of elliptic curves.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"J-line"}
