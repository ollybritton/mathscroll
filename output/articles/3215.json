{"title":"Conical surface","summary":"In geometry, a (general) conical surface is the unbounded surface formed by the union of all the straight lines that pass through a fixed point — the apex or vertex — and any point of some fixed space curve — the directrix — that does not contain the apex.  Each of those lines is called a generatrix of the surface.","image":"DoubleCone.png.webp","url":"Conical_surface"}
