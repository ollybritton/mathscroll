{"title":"Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence","summary":"In mathematics, Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence allows one to correspond a Lie group to a Lie algebra or vice versa, and study the conditions for such a relationship. Lie groups that are isomorphic to each other have Lie algebras that are isomorphic to each other, but the converse is not necessarily true. One obvious counterexample is R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} and T n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {T} ^{n}} (see real coordinate space and the circle group respectively) which are non-isomorphic to each other as Lie groups but their Lie algebras are isomorphic to each other. However, by restricting our attention to the simply connected Lie groups, the Lie group-Lie algebra correspondence will be one-to-one.[1]","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Lie_group–Lie_algebra_correspondence"}
