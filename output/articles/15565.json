{"title":"Tensor decomposition","summary":"In multilinear algebra, a tensor decomposition[1][2] [3] is any scheme for expressing a \"data tensor\" (M-way array) as a sequence of elementary operations acting on other, often simpler tensors. Many tensor decompositions generalize some matrix decompositions.[4]","image":"266afabd0c3ccc3d29d938787d59664e7b3ec22a.svg","url":"Tensor_decomposition"}
