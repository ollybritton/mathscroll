{"title":"Stanley–Reisner ring","summary":"In mathematics, a Stanley–Reisner ring, or face ring, is a quotient of a polynomial algebra over a field by a square-free monomial  ideal. Such ideals are described more geometrically in terms of finite simplicial complexes. The Stanley–Reisner ring construction is a basic tool within algebraic combinatorics and combinatorial commutative algebra.[1]  Its properties were investigated by Richard Stanley, Melvin Hochster, and Gerald Reisner in the early 1970s.","image":"261c1d5a5f833e65b5cb4e04c5c6d63849a06f82.svg","url":"Stanley–Reisner_ring"}
