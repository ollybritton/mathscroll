{"title":"Sylvester–Gallai theorem","summary":"The Sylvester–Gallai theorem in geometry states that every finite set of points in the Euclidean plane has a line that passes through exactly two of the points or a line that passes through all of them. It is named after James Joseph Sylvester, who posed it as a problem in 1893, and Tibor Gallai, who published one of the first proofs of this theorem in 1944.","image":"Ordinary_lines.svg.png.webp","url":"Sylvester–Gallai_theorem"}
