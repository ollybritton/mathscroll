{"title":"Congruence relation","summary":"In abstract algebra, a congruence relation (or simply congruence) is an equivalence relation on an algebraic structure (such as a group, ring, or vector space) that is compatible with the structure in the sense that algebraic operations done with equivalent elements will yield equivalent elements.[1]  Every congruence relation has a corresponding quotient structure, whose elements are the equivalence classes (or congruence classes) for the relation.[2]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Congruence_relation"}
