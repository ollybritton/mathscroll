{"title":"16-cell honeycomb honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 5-space, the 16-cell honeycomb honeycomb is one of five paracompact regular space-filling tessellations (or honeycombs). It is called paracompact because it has infinite vertex figures, with all vertices as ideal points at infinity. With Schl√§fli symbol {3,3,4,3,3}, it has three 16-cell honeycombs around each cell. It is self-dual.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"16-cell_honeycomb_honeycomb"}
