{"title":"Zig-zag product","summary":"In graph theory, the zig-zag product of regular graphs G , H {\\displaystyle G,H} , denoted by G âˆ˜ H {\\displaystyle G\\circ H} , is a binary operation which takes a large graph ( G {\\displaystyle G} ) and a small graph ( H {\\displaystyle H} ) and produces a graph that approximately inherits the size of the large one but the degree of the small one. An important property of the zig-zag product is that if H {\\displaystyle H} is a good expander, then the expansion of the resulting graph is only slightly worse than the expansion of G {\\displaystyle G} .","image":"bf237bbceb4b77e003c5a0ae36bd088de9735903.svg","url":"Zig-zag_product"}
