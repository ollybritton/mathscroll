{"title":"Unit circle","summary":"In mathematics, a unit circle is a circle of unit radiusâ€”that is, a radius of 1.[1]  Frequently, especially in trigonometry, the unit circle is the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin (0, 0) in the Cartesian coordinate system in the Euclidean plane. In topology, it is often denoted as S1 because it is a one-dimensional unit n-sphere.[2][note 1]","image":"Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_1.svg.png.webp","url":"Unit_circle"}
