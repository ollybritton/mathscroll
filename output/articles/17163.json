{"title":"Zeroth-order logic","summary":"Zeroth-order logic is a branch of logic without variables or quantifiers. Some authors use the phrase \"zeroth-order logic\" as a synonym for the propositional calculus,[1] but an alternative definition extends propositional logic by adding constants, operations, and relations on non-Boolean values.[2] Every zeroth-order language in this broader sense is complete and compact.[2]","image":"Socrates.png.webp","url":"Zeroth-order_logic"}
