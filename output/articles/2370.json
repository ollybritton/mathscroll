{"title":"Cauchy problem","summary":"A Cauchy problem in mathematics asks for the solution of a partial differential equation that satisfies certain conditions that are given on a hypersurface in the domain.[1] A Cauchy problem can be an initial value problem or a boundary value problem (for this case see also Cauchy boundary condition). It is named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy.","image":"ac9b1e9a3a4b08a6155f46db4a5119f0e5e1f458.svg","url":"Cauchy_problem"}
