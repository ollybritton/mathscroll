{"title":"Collaboration graph","summary":"In mathematics and social science, a collaboration graph[1][2] is a graph modeling some social network where the vertices represent participants of that network (usually individual people) and where two distinct participants are joined by an edge whenever there is a collaborative relationship between them of a particular kind. Collaboration graphs are used to measure the closeness of collaborative relationships between the participants of the network.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Collaboration_graph"}
