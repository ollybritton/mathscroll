{"title":"Mutually orthogonal Latin squares","summary":"In combinatorics, two Latin squares of the same size (order) are said to be orthogonal if when superimposed the ordered paired entries in the positions are all distinct. A set of Latin squares, all of the same order, all pairs of which are orthogonal is called a set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares. This concept of orthogonality in combinatorics is strongly related to the concept of blocking in statistics, which ensures that independent variables are truly independent with no hidden confounding correlations. \"Orthogonal\" is thus synonymous with \"independent\" in that knowing one variable's value gives no further information about another variable's likely value.","image":"GraecoLatinSquare-Order3.svg.png.webp","url":"Mutually_orthogonal_Latin_squares"}
