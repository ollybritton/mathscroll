{"title":"Matroid girth","summary":"In matroid theory, a mathematical discipline, the girth of a matroid is the size of its smallest circuit or dependent set. The cogirth of a matroid is the girth of its dual matroid. Matroid girth generalizes the notion of the shortest cycle in a graph, the edge connectivity of a graph, Hall sets in bipartite graphs, even sets in families of sets, and general position of point sets. It is hard to compute, but fixed-parameter tractable for linear matroids when parameterized both by the matroid rank and the field size of a linear representation.","image":"3249146144e82c4308c6b41154f26a5a83c0ba33.svg","url":"Matroid_girth"}
