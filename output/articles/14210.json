{"title":"Serre's multiplicity conjectures","summary":"In mathematics, Serre's multiplicity conjectures, named after Jean-Pierre Serre, are certain purely algebraic problems, in commutative algebra, motivated by the needs of algebraic geometry. Since Andr√© Weil's initial definition of intersection numbers, around 1949, there had been a question of how to provide a more flexible and computable theory.","image":"ed1846bfb29fd85504c0479fcea96128d55b319a.svg","url":"Serre's_multiplicity_conjectures"}
