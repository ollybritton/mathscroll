{"title":"Pólya conjecture","summary":"In number theory, the Pólya conjecture (or Pólya's conjecture) stated that \"most\" (i.e., 50% or more) of the natural numbers less than any given number have an odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was set forth by the Hungarian mathematician George Pólya in 1919,[1] and proved false in 1958 by C. Brian Haselgrove. Though mathematicians typically refer to this statement as the Pólya conjecture, Pólya never actually conjectured that the statement was true; rather, he showed that the truth of the statement would imply the Riemann hypothesis. For this reason, it is more accurately called \"Pólya's problem\".","image":"Liouville-big.svg.png.webp","url":"Pólya_conjecture"}
