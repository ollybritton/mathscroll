{"title":"Vitali–Carathéodory theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Vitali–Carathéodory theorem is a result in real analysis that shows that, under the conditions stated below, integrable functions can be approximated in L1 from above and below by lower- and upper-semicontinuous functions, respectively. It is named after Giuseppe Vitali and Constantin Carathéodory.","image":"78f7f4e31723704ea0f5801e7134ad03a3495701.svg","url":"Vitali–Carathéodory_theorem"}
