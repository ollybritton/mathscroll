{"title":"Multivariate random variable","summary":"In probability, and statistics, a multivariate random variable or random vector is a list or vector of mathematical variables each of whose value is unknown, either because the value has not yet occurred or because there is imperfect knowledge of its value.  The individual variables in a random vector are grouped together because they are all part of a single mathematical system â€” often they represent different properties of an individual statistical unit. For example, while a given person has a specific age, height and weight, the representation of these features of an unspecified person from within a group would be a random vector. Normally each element of a random vector is a real number.","image":"Standard_deviation_diagram_micro.svg.png.webp","url":"Multivariate_random_variable"}
