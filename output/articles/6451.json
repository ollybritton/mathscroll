{"title":"Graph (topology)","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, a graph is a topological space which arises from a usual graph G = ( E , V ) {\\displaystyle G=(E,V)} by replacing vertices by points and each edge e = x y âˆˆ E {\\displaystyle e=xy\\in E} by a copy of the unit interval I = [ 0 , 1 ] {\\displaystyle I=[0,1]} , where 0 {\\displaystyle 0} is identified with the point associated to x {\\displaystyle x} and 1 {\\displaystyle 1} with the point associated to y {\\displaystyle y} . That is, as topological spaces, graphs are exactly the simplicial 1-complexes and also exactly the one-dimensional CW complexes.[1]","image":"d7c252f40ee7bdd95534eb8482c51bb0097dee9a.svg","url":"Graph_(topology)"}
