{"title":"Divisibility rule","summary":"A divisibility rule is a shorthand and useful way of determining whether a given integer is divisible by a fixed divisor without performing the division, usually by examining its digits. Although there are divisibility tests for numbers in any radix, or base, and they are all different, this article presents rules and examples only for decimal, or base 10, numbers.  Martin Gardner explained and popularized these rules in his September 1962 \"Mathematical Games\" column in Scientific American.[1]","image":"90dd1bbf66ac9e4a09c94d613b07855b4f58ee54.svg","url":"Divisibility_rule"}
