{"title":"Mathieu group","summary":"In group theory, a topic in abstract algebra, the Mathieu groups are the five sporadic simple groups M11, M12, M22, M23 and M24 introduced by MathieuÂ (1861, 1873). They are multiply transitive permutation groups on 11, 12, 22, 23 or 24 objects.  They were the first sporadic groups to be discovered.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Mathieu_group"}
