{"title":"Boltzmann sampler","summary":"A Boltzmann sampler is an algorithm intended for random sampling of combinatorial structures. If the object size is viewed as its energy, and the argument of the corresponding generating function is interpreted in terms of the temperature of the physical system, then a Boltzmann sampler returns an object from a classical Boltzmann distribution.","image":"e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019.svg","url":"Boltzmann_sampler"}
