{"title":"Fraïssé limit","summary":"In mathematical logic, specifically in the discipline of model theory, the Fraïssé limit (also called the Fraïssé construction or Fraïssé amalgamation) is a method used to construct (infinite) mathematical structures from their (finite) substructures. It is a special example of the more general concept of a direct limit in a category.[1] The technique was developed in the 1950s by its namesake, French logician Roland Fraïssé.[2]","image":"368b3827262016c64b340a761d9b95e0b031d6dd.svg","url":"Fraïssé_limit"}
