{"title":"Teichmüller–Tukey lemma","summary":"In mathematics, the Teichmüller–Tukey lemma (sometimes named just Tukey's lemma), named after John Tukey and Oswald Teichmüller, is a lemma that states that every nonempty collection of finite character has a maximal element with respect to inclusion. Over Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the Teichmüller–Tukey lemma is equivalent to the axiom of choice, and therefore to the well-ordering theorem, Zorn's lemma, and the Hausdorff maximal principle.[1]","image":"205d4b91000d9dcf1a5bbabdfa6a8395fa60b676.svg","url":"Teichmüller–Tukey_lemma"}
