{"title":"Sturm's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Sturm sequence of a univariate polynomial p is a sequence of polynomials associated with p and its derivative by a variant of Euclid's algorithm for polynomials. Sturm's theorem expresses the number of distinct real roots of p located in an interval in terms of the number of changes of signs of the values of the Sturm sequence at the bounds of the interval. Applied to the interval of all the real numbers, it gives the total number of real roots of p.[1]","image":"e57061dea662ac3954e11f7a5eb9f83e5725717d.svg","url":"Sturm's_theorem"}
