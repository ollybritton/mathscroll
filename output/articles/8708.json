{"title":"Kirby calculus","summary":"In mathematics, the Kirby calculus in geometric topology, named after Robion Kirby, is a method for modifying framed links in the 3-sphere using a finite set of moves, the Kirby moves.  Using four-dimensional Cerf theory, he proved that if M and N are 3-manifolds, resulting from Dehn surgery on framed links L and J respectively, then they are homeomorphic if and only if L and J are related by a sequence of Kirby moves.  According to the Lickorishâ€“Wallace theorem any closed orientable 3-manifold is obtained by such surgery on some link in the 3-sphere.","image":"e4abb9b9dab94f7b25a4210364f0f9032704bfb9.svg","url":"Kirby_calculus"}
