{"title":"Hinged dissection","summary":"In geometry, a hinged dissection, also known as a swing-hinged dissection or Dudeney dissection,[1] is a kind of geometric dissection in which all of the pieces are connected into a chain by \"hinged\" points, such that the rearrangement from one figure to another can be carried out by swinging the chain continuously, without severing any of the connections.[2] Typically, it is assumed that the pieces are allowed to overlap in the folding and unfolding process;[3] this is sometimes called the \"wobbly-hinged\" model of hinged dissection.[4]","image":"Hinged_dissection_3-4-6-3_loop.gif","url":"Hinged_dissection"}
