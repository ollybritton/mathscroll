{"title":"Great icosacronic hexecontahedron","summary":"In geometry, the great icosacronic hexecontahedron (or great sagittal trisicosahedron) is the dual of the great icosicosidodecahedron. Its faces are darts. A part of each dart lies inside the solid, hence is invisible in solid models.","image":"DU48_great_icosacronic_hexecontahedron.png.webp","url":"Great_icosacronic_hexecontahedron"}
