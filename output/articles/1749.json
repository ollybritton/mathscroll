{"title":"Blaschke sum","summary":"In convex geometry and the geometry of convex polytopes, the Blaschke sum of two polytopes is a polytope that has a facet parallel to each facet of the two given polytopes, with the same measure. When both polytopes have parallel facets, the measure of the corresponding facet in the Blaschke sum is the sum of the measures from the two given polytopes.[1]","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Blaschke_sum"}
