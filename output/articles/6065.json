{"title":"Generalized arithmetic progression","summary":"In mathematics, a generalized arithmetic progression (or multiple arithmetic progression) is a generalization of an arithmetic progression equipped with multiple common differences – whereas an arithmetic progression is generated by a single common difference, a generalized arithmetic progression can be generated by multiple common differences. For example, the sequence 17 , 20 , 22 , 23 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , … {\\displaystyle 17,20,22,23,25,26,27,28,29,\\dots } is not an arithmetic progression, but is instead generated by starting with 17 and adding either 3 or 5, thus allowing multiple common differences to generate it. A semilinear set generalizes this idea to multiple dimensions -- it is a set of vectors of integers, rather than a set of integers.","image":"c7d4c7c6021263327e3306cde087f75716723615.svg","url":"Generalized_arithmetic_progression"}
