{"title":"Hyperelliptic curve cryptography","summary":"Hyperelliptic curve cryptography is similar to elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) insofar as the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve is an abelian group in which to do arithmetic, just as we use the group of points on an elliptic curve in ECC.","image":"d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77.svg","url":"Hyperelliptic_curve_cryptography"}
