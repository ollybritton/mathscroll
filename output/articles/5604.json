{"title":"Four-spiral semigroup","summary":"In mathematics, the  four-spiral semigroup is a special semigroup generated by four idempotent elements. This special semigroup was first studied by Karl Byleen in a doctoral dissertation submitted to the University of Nebraska in 1977.[1][2] It has several interesting properties: it is one of the most important examples of bi-simple but not completely-simple semigroups;[3] it is also an important example of a fundamental regular semigroup;[2] it is an indispensable building block of bisimple, idempotent-generated regular semigroups.[2] A certain semigroup, called double four-spiral semigroup, generated by five idempotent elements has also been studied along with the four-spiral semigroup.[4][2]","image":"ac6d07ba433768e55dc662720eb3362a389afa8a.svg","url":"Four-spiral_semigroup"}
