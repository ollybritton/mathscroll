{"title":"Variational integrator","summary":"Variational integrators are numerical integrators for Hamiltonian systems derived from the Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations of a discretized Hamilton's principle. Variational integrators are momentum-preserving and symplectic.","image":"c788fa18d5165204aac831f11527175cf807eddd.svg","url":"Variational_integrator"}
