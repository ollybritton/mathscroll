{"title":"Data model","summary":"A data model[1][2][3][4][5] is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. For instance, a data model may specify that the data element representing a car be composed of a number of other elements which, in turn, represent the color and size of the car and define its owner.","image":"Data_modeling_context.svg.png.webp","url":"Data_model"}
