{"title":"Property P conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the Property P conjecture is a statement about 3-manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere. A knot in the 3-sphere is said to have Property P if every 3-manifold obtained by performing (non-trivial) Dehn surgery on the knot is not simply-connected. The conjecture states that all knots, except the unknot, have Property P.","image":"f0af63e077237c7e1d23bcdf007a69ccde62a98b.svg","url":"Property_P_conjecture"}
