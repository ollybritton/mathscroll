{"title":"Phase plane","summary":"In applied mathematics, in particular the context of nonlinear system analysis, a phase plane is a visual display of certain characteristics of certain kinds of differential equations; a coordinate plane with axes being the values of the two state variables, say (x, y), or (q, p) etc. (any pair of variables). It is a two-dimensional case of the general n-dimensional phase space.","image":"573740447afc0c24087faa4e6e0588e97f9703c7.svg","url":"Phase_plane"}
