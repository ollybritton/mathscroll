{"title":"Bounded type (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a function defined on a region of the complex plane is said to be of bounded type if it is equal to the ratio of two analytic functions bounded in that region. But more generally, a function is of bounded type in a region Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } if and only if f {\\displaystyle f} is analytic on Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } and log + ⁡ | f ( z ) | {\\displaystyle \\log ^{+}|f(z)|} has a harmonic majorant on Ω , {\\displaystyle \\Omega ,} where log + ⁡ ( x ) = max [ 0 , log ⁡ ( x ) ] {\\displaystyle \\log ^{+}(x)=\\max[0,\\log(x)]} . Being the ratio of two bounded analytic functions is a sufficient condition for a function to be of bounded type (defined in terms of a harmonic majorant), and if Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } is simply connected the condition is also necessary.","image":"24b0d5ca6f381068d756f6337c08e0af9d1eeb6f.svg","url":"Bounded_type_(mathematics)"}
