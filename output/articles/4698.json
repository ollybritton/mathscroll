{"title":"Eisenstein reciprocity","summary":"In algebraic number theory Eisenstein's reciprocity law is a reciprocity law that extends the law of quadratic reciprocity and the cubic reciprocity law to residues of higher powers. It is one of the earliest and simplest of the higher reciprocity laws, and is a consequence of several later and stronger reciprocity laws such as the Artin reciprocity law. It was introduced by EisensteinÂ (1850), though Jacobi had previously announced (without proof) a similar result for the special cases of 5th, 8th and 12th powers in 1839.[1]","image":"7f27527902d05e4c32bcbe28d425d7790f8ae191.svg","url":"Eisenstein_reciprocity"}
