{"title":"Conjugate transpose","summary":"In mathematics, the conjugate transpose, also known as the Hermitian transpose, of an m × n {\\displaystyle m\\times n} complex matrix A {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {A}}} is an n × m {\\displaystyle n\\times m} matrix obtained by transposing A {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {A}}} and applying complex conjugate on each entry (the complex conjugate of a + i b {\\displaystyle a+ib} being a − i b {\\displaystyle a-ib} , for real numbers a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} ). It is often denoted as A H {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {A}}^{\\mathrm {H} }} or A ∗ {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {A}}^{*}} [1] or A ′ {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {A}}'} ,[2] and very commonly in physics as A † {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {A}}^{\\dagger }} .","image":"12b23d207d23dd430b93320539abbb0bde84870d.svg","url":"Conjugate_transpose"}
