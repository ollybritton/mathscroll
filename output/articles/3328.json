{"title":"Continuous q-Hermite polynomials","summary":"In mathematics,  the continuous q-Hermite polynomials  are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme. Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties.","image":"62263e1bd97f02843562218366b8cd2b7804c2f7.svg","url":"Continuous_q-Hermite_polynomials"}
