{"title":"Affine root system","summary":"In mathematics, an affine root system is a root system of affine-linear functions on a Euclidean space. They are used in the classification of affine Lie algebras and superalgebras, and semisimple p-adic algebraic groups, and correspond to families of Macdonald polynomials. The reduced affine root systems were used by Kac and Moody in their work on Kacâ€“Moody algebras.  Possibly non-reduced affine root systems were introduced and classified by Macdonald (1972) and Bruhat & Tits (1972) (except that both these papers accidentally omitted the Dynkin diagram ).","image":"Dyn-node.png.webp","url":"Affine_root_system"}
