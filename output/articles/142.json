{"title":"97.5th percentile point","summary":"In probability and statistics, the 97.5th percentile point of the standard normal distribution is a number commonly used for statistical calculations. The approximate value of this number is 1.96, meaning that 95% of the area under a normal curve lies within approximately 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Because of the central limit theorem, this number is used in the construction of approximate 95% confidence intervals. Its ubiquity is due to the arbitrary but common convention of using confidence intervals with 95% probability in science and frequentist statistics, though other probabilities (90%, 99%, etc.) are sometimes used.[1][2][3][4] This convention seems particularly common in medical statistics,[5][6][7] but is also common in other areas of application, such as earth sciences,[8] social sciences and business research.[9]","image":"NormalDist1.96.png.webp","url":"97.5th_percentile_point"}
