{"title":"Closeness (mathematics)","summary":"Closeness is a basic concept in topology and related areas in mathematics. Intuitively we say two sets are close if they are arbitrarily near to each other. The concept can be defined naturally in a metric space where a notion of distance between elements of the space is defined, but it can be generalized to topological spaces where we have no concrete way to measure distances.","image":"cb4d7a16bca9e216c0221b43a1c3377aa5e358b8.svg","url":"Closeness_(mathematics)"}
