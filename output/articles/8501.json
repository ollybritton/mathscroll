{"title":"Jury theorem","summary":"A jury theorem is a mathematical theorem proving that, under certain assumptions, a decision attained using majority voting in a large group is more likely to be correct than a decision attained by a single expert. It serves as a formal argument for the idea of wisdom of the crowd, for decision of questions of fact by jury trial, and for democracy in general.[1]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Jury_theorem"}
