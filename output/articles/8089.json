{"title":"Isotypical representation","summary":"In group theory, an isotypical, primary or factor representation[1] of a group G is a unitary representation π : G ⟶ B ( H ) {\\displaystyle \\pi :G\\longrightarrow {\\mathcal {B}}({\\mathcal {H}})} such that any two subrepresentations have equivalent sub-subrepresentations.[2]  This is related to the notion of a primary or factor representation of a C*-algebra, or to the factor for a von Neumann algebra: the representation π {\\displaystyle \\pi } of G is isotypical iff π ( G ) ″ {\\displaystyle \\pi (G)^{''}} is a factor.","image":"f73dec54f5a475b9b13fc97511edbac3be8cd6b4.svg","url":"Isotypical_representation"}
