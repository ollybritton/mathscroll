{"title":"Tensor product of algebras","summary":"In mathematics, the tensor product of two algebras over a commutative ring R is also an R-algebra. This gives the tensor product of algebras. When the ring is a field, the most common application of such products is to describe the product of algebra representations.","image":"Latex_integers.svg.png.webp","url":"Tensor_product_of_algebras"}
