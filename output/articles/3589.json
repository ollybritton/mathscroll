{"title":"Crystal Ball function","summary":"The Crystal Ball function, named after the Crystal Ball Collaboration (hence the capitalized initial letters), is a probability density function commonly used to model various lossy processes in high-energy physics. It consists of a Gaussian core portion and a power-law low-end tail, below a certain threshold. The function itself and its first derivative are both continuous.","image":"CrystalBallFunction.svg.png.webp","url":"Crystal_Ball_function"}
