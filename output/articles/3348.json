{"title":"Contraction morphism","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a contraction morphism is a surjective projective morphism f : X → Y {\\displaystyle f:X\\to Y} between normal projective varieties (or projective schemes) such that f ∗ O X = O Y {\\displaystyle f_{*}{\\mathcal {O}}_{X}={\\mathcal {O}}_{Y}} or, equivalently, the geometric fibers are all connected (Zariski's connectedness theorem). It is also commonly called an algebraic fiber space, as it is an analog of a fiber space in algebraic topology.","image":"abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c.svg","url":"Contraction_morphism"}
