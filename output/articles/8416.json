{"title":"Jordan normal form","summary":"In linear algebra, a Jordan normal form, also known as a Jordan canonical form (JCF),[1][2] is an upper triangular matrix of a particular form called a Jordan matrix representing a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space with respect to some basis. Such a matrix has each non-zero off-diagonal entry equal toÂ 1, immediately above the main diagonal (on the superdiagonal), and with identical diagonal entries to the left and below them.","image":"Jordan_canonical_form.svg.png.webp","url":"Jordan_normal_form"}
