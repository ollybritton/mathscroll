{"title":"Alphabetic numeral system","summary":"An alphabetic numeral system is a type of numeral system. Developed in classical antiquity, it flourished during the early Middle Ages.[1] In alphabetic numeral systems, numbers are written using the characters of an alphabet, syllabary, or another writing system. Unlike acrophonic numeral systems, where a numeral is represented by the first letter of the lexical name of the numeral, alphabetic numeral systems can arbitrarily assign letters to numerical values. Some systems, including the Arabic, Georgian and Hebrew systems, use an already established alphabetical order.[2] Alphabetic numeral systems originated with Greek numerals around 600 BC and became largely extinct by the 16th century.[3] After the development of positional numeral systems like Hinduâ€“Arabic numerals, the use of alphabetic numeral systems dwindled to predominantly ordered lists, pagination, religious functions, and divinatory magic.[4]","image":"b2df01411fa9eab03fb92a7945063456e69b00d4.svg","url":"Alphabetic_numeral_system"}
