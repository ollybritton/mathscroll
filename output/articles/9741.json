{"title":"Lp space","summary":"In mathematics, the Lp spaces are function spaces defined using a natural generalization of the p-norm for finite-dimensional vector spaces. They are sometimes called Lebesgue spaces, named after Henri Lebesgue (Dunford & Schwartz 1958, III.3), although according to the Bourbaki group (Bourbaki 1987) they were first introduced by Frigyes Riesz (Riesz 1910).","image":"cf2317aaca1ecee4b8ccf667bc1001059eae5850.svg","url":"Lp_space"}
