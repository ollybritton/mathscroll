{"title":"Smn theorem","summary":"In computability theory the S mn  theorem, (also called the translation lemma, parameter theorem, and the parameterization theorem) is a basic result about programming languages (and, more generally, Gödel numberings of the computable functions) (Soare 1987, Rogers 1967).  It was first proved by Stephen Cole Kleene (1943). The name S mn  comes from the occurrence of an S with subscript n and superscript m in the original formulation of the theorem (see below).","image":"33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e.svg","url":"Smn_theorem"}
