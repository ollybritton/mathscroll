{"title":"Quotient rule","summary":"In calculus, the quotient rule is a method of finding the derivative of a function that is the ratio of two differentiable functions.[1][2][3] Let h ( x ) = f ( x ) / g ( x ) , {\\displaystyle h(x)=f(x)/g(x),} where both f and g are differentiable and g ( x ) â‰  0. {\\displaystyle g(x)\\neq 0.} The quotient rule states that the derivative of h(x) is","image":"c348edc73c31928afc9d0eaa687358b386af3110.svg","url":"Quotient_rule"}
