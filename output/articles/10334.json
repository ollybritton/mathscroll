{"title":"Meshulam's game","summary":"In graph theory, Meshulam's game is a game used to explain a theorem of Roy Meshulam[1] related to the homological connectivity of the independence complex of a graph, which is the smallest index k such that all reduced homological groups up to and including k are trivial. The formulation of this theorem as a game is due to Aharoni, Berger and Ziv.[2][3]","image":"302cac0e1db2869202509d835c9e64065623d7c8.svg","url":"Meshulam's_game"}
