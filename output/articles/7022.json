{"title":"Helly space","summary":"In mathematics, and particularly functional analysis, the Helly space, named after Eduard Helly, consists of all monotonically increasing functions ƒ : [0,1] → [0,1], where [0,1] denotes the closed interval given by the set of all x such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.[1] In other words, for all 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 we have 0 ≤ ƒ(x) ≤ 1 and also if x ≤ y then ƒ(x) ≤ ƒ(y).","image":"077ef2cb16c08e434d63ded25a1648144ce4f989.svg","url":"Helly_space"}
