{"title":"Weight (strings)","summary":"The a {\\displaystyle a} -weight of a string, for a letter a {\\displaystyle a} , is the number of times that letter occurs in the string.  More precisely, let A {\\displaystyle A} be a finite set (called the alphabet), a ∈ A {\\displaystyle a\\in A} a letter of A {\\displaystyle A} , and c ∈ A ∗ {\\displaystyle c\\in A^{*}} a string (where A ∗ {\\displaystyle A^{*}} is the free monoid generated by the elements of A {\\displaystyle A} , equivalently the set of strings, including the empty string, whose letters are from A {\\displaystyle A} ). Then the a {\\displaystyle a} -weight of c {\\displaystyle c} , denoted by w t a ( c ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {wt} _{a}(c)} , is the number of times the generator a {\\displaystyle a} occurs in the unique expression for c {\\displaystyle c} as a product (concatenation) of letters in A {\\displaystyle A} .","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"Weight_(strings)"}
