{"title":"Parry–Sullivan invariant","summary":"In mathematics, the Parry–Sullivan invariant (or Parry–Sullivan number) is a numerical quantity of interest in the study of incidence matrices in graph theory, and of certain one-dimensional dynamical systems. It provides a partial classification of non-trivial irreducible incidence matrices.","image":"b0573671f14456b30f0e4a8ad2aeb6257ec84316.svg","url":"Parry–Sullivan_invariant"}
