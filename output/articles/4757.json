{"title":"Elliptic hypergeometric series","summary":"In mathematics, an elliptic hypergeometric series is a series Σcn such that the ratio cn/cn−1 is an elliptic function of n, analogous to generalized hypergeometric series where the ratio is a rational function of n, and basic hypergeometric series where the ratio is a periodic function of the complex number  n.  They were introduced by Date-Jimbo-Kuniba-Miwa-Okado (1987) and Frenkel & Turaev (1997) in their study of elliptic 6-j symbols.","image":"9367a6e78db1fca1d28987d7fd6c731a2bf025eb.svg","url":"Elliptic_hypergeometric_series"}
