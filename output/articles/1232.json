{"title":"BCMP network","summary":"In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, a BCMP network is a class of queueing network for which a product-form equilibrium distribution exists. It is named after the authors of the paper where the network was first described: Baskett, Chandy, Muntz and Palacios. The theorem is a significant extension to a Jackson network allowing virtually arbitrary customer routing and service time distributions, subject to particular service disciplines.[1]","image":"3ea30a3a3d7f4ee76caa783742fc823dc0061b19.svg","url":"BCMP_network"}
