{"title":"Stone duality","summary":"In mathematics, there is an ample supply of categorical dualities between certain categories of topological spaces and categories of partially ordered sets. Today, these dualities are usually collected under the label Stone duality, since they form a natural generalization of Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras. These concepts are named in honor of Marshall Stone. Stone-type dualities also provide the foundation for pointless topology and are exploited in theoretical computer science for the study of formal semantics.","image":"1be2471c5c9c916fcf1b10fc6d4134a3a2fb1f1f.svg","url":"Stone_duality"}
