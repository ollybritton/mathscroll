{"title":"Buzen's algorithm","summary":"In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, Buzen's algorithm (or  convolution algorithm) is an algorithm for calculating the normalization constant G(N) in the Gordonâ€“Newell theorem. This method was first proposed by Jeffrey P. Buzen in 1973.[1] Computing G(N) is required to compute the stationary probability distribution of a closed queueing network.[2]","image":"3fa3e061418b6e8074cdd9f93061891417a2ef27.svg","url":"Buzen's_algorithm"}
