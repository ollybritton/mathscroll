{"title":"Banach manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a Banach manifold is a manifold modeled on Banach spaces. Thus it is a topological space in which each point has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to an open set in a Banach space (a more involved and formal definition is given below). Banach manifolds are one possibility of extending manifolds to infinite dimensions.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Banach_manifold"}
