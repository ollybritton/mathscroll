{"title":"Elongated triangular bipyramid","summary":"In geometry, the elongated triangular bipyramid (or dipyramid) or triakis triangular prism is one of the Johnson solids (J14), convex polyhedra whose faces are regular polygons. As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a triangular bipyramid (J12) by inserting a triangular prism between its congruent halves.","image":"Elongated_triangular_dipyramid.png.webp","url":"Elongated_triangular_bipyramid"}
