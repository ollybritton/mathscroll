{"title":"Permutation graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a permutation graph is a graph whose vertices represent the elements of a permutation, and whose edges represent pairs of elements that are reversed by the permutation. Permutation graphs may also be defined geometrically, as the intersection graphs of line segments whose endpoints lie on two parallel lines. Different permutations may give rise to the same permutation graph; a given graph has a unique representation (up to permutation symmetry) if it is prime with respect to the modular decomposition.[1]","image":"Permutation_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Permutation_graph"}
