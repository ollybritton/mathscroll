{"title":"Torsor (algebraic geometry)","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a torsor or a principal bundle is an analog of a principal bundle in algebraic topology. Because there are few open sets in Zariski topology, it is more common to consider torsors in Ã©tale topology or some other flat topologies. The notion also generalizes a Galois extension in abstract algebra.","image":"cf585fc9951eb246534442f8c0748136668dd9f4.svg","url":"Torsor_(algebraic_geometry)"}
