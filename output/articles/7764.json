{"title":"Infinite-order hexagonal tiling","summary":"In 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, the infinite-order hexagonal tiling is a regular tiling. It has Schläfli symbol of {6,∞}. All vertices are ideal, located at \"infinity\", seen on the boundary of the Poincaré hyperbolic disk projection.","image":"H2_tiling_26i-4.png.webp","url":"Infinite-order_hexagonal_tiling"}
