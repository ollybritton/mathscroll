{"title":"First uncountable ordinal","summary":"In mathematics, the first uncountable ordinal, traditionally denoted by ω 1 {\\displaystyle \\omega _{1}} or sometimes by Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } , is the smallest ordinal number that, considered as a set, is uncountable. It is the supremum (least upper bound) of all countable ordinals. When considered as a set, the elements of ω 1 {\\displaystyle \\omega _{1}} are the countable ordinals (including finite ordinals),[1] of which there are uncountably many.","image":"e20e29ac56d6cc52eaeb2f9c0bf79ef706428ddf.svg","url":"First_uncountable_ordinal"}
