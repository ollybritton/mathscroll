{"title":"Proof by exhaustion","summary":"Proof by exhaustion, also known as proof by cases, proof by case analysis, complete induction or the brute force method, is a method of mathematical proof in which the statement to be proved is split into a finite number of cases or sets of equivalent cases, and where each type of case is checked to see if the proposition in question holds.[1] This is a method of direct proof. A proof by exhaustion typically contains two stages:","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Proof_by_exhaustion"}
