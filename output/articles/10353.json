{"title":"Method of analytic tableaux","summary":"In proof theory, the semantic tableau (/tæˈbloʊ, ˈtæbloʊ/; plural: tableaux, also called truth tree) is a decision procedure for sentential and related logics, and a proof procedure for formulae of first-order logic. An analytic tableau is a tree structure computed for a logical formula, having at each node a subformula of the original formula to be proved or refuted.  Computation constructs this tree and uses it to prove or refute the whole formula.  The tableau method can also determine the satisfiability of finite sets of formulas of various logics. It is the most popular proof procedure for modal logics (Girle 2000).","image":"Partially_built_tableau.svg.png.webp","url":"Method_of_analytic_tableaux"}
