{"title":"Folkman graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Folkman graph is a 4-regular graph with 20 vertices and 40 edges. It is a regular bipartite graph with symmetries taking every edge to every other edge, but the two sides of its bipartition are not symmetric with each other, making it the smallest possible semi-symmetric graph.[1] It is named after Jon Folkman, who constructed it for this property in 1967.[2]","image":"Folkman_graph_alt.svg.png.webp","url":"Folkman_graph"}
