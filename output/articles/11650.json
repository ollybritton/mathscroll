{"title":"Outline of discrete mathematics","summary":"Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.  In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying \"smoothly\", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers,  graphs, and statements in logic[1] – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.[2] Discrete mathematics, therefore, excludes topics in \"continuous mathematics\" such as calculus and analysis.","image":"c216094ecd1fc52a297a6c4375f9fcb3c20310d3.svg","url":"Outline_of_discrete_mathematics"}
