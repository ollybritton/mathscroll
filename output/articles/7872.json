{"title":"Integral domain","summary":"In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, an integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.[1][2] Integral domains are generalizations of the ring of integers and provide a natural setting for studying divisibility.  In an integral domain, every nonzero element a has the cancellation property, that is, if a â‰  0, an equality ab = ac implies b = c.","image":"Latex_integers.svg.png.webp","url":"Integral_domain"}
