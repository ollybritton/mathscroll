{"title":"Bures metric","summary":"In mathematics, in the area of quantum information geometry, the Bures metric (named after Donald Bures)[1] or Helstrom metric (named after Carl W. Helstrom)[2] defines an infinitesimal distance between density matrix operators defining quantum states. It is a quantum generalization of the Fisher information metric, and is identical to the Fubiniâ€“Study metric[3] when restricted to the pure states alone.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Bures_metric"}
