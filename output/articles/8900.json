{"title":"Ky Fan inequality","summary":"In mathematics, there are two different results that share the common name of the Ky Fan inequality.  One is an inequality involving the geometric mean and arithmetic mean of two sets of real numbers of the unit interval. The result was published on pageÂ 5 of the book Inequalities by Edwin F. Beckenbach and Richard E. Bellman (1961), who refer to an unpublished result of Ky Fan. They mention the result in connection with the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means and Augustin Louis Cauchy's proof of this inequality by forward-backward-induction; a method which can also be used to prove the Ky Fan inequality.","image":"aa86b89b4806108a078b5bcc6c93aa32ef63c8a5.svg","url":"Ky_Fan_inequality"}
