{"title":"Sample space","summary":"In probability theory, the sample space (also called sample description space,[1] possibility space,[2] or outcome space[3]) of an experiment or random trial is the set of all possible outcomes or results of that experiment.[4] A sample space is usually denoted using set notation, and the possible ordered outcomes, or sample points,[5] are listed as elements in the set. It is common to refer to a sample space by the labels S, Î©, or U (for \"universal set\"). The elements of a sample space may be numbers, words, letters, or symbols. They can also be finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite.[6]","image":"Standard_deviation_diagram_micro.svg.png.webp","url":"Sample_space"}
