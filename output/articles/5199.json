{"title":"Extended finite element method","summary":"The extended finite element method (XFEM), is a numerical technique based on the generalized finite element method (GFEM) and the partition of unity method (PUM). It extends the classical finite element method (FEM) approach by enriching the solution space for solutions to differential equations with discontinuous functions.","image":"Example_of_2D_mesh.png.webp","url":"Extended_finite_element_method"}
