{"title":"Mountain pass theorem","summary":"The mountain pass theorem is an existence theorem from the calculus of variations, originally due to Antonio Ambrosetti and Paul Rabinowitz.[1]  Given certain conditions on a function, the theorem demonstrates the existence of a saddle point.  The theorem is unusual in that there are many other theorems regarding the existence of extrema, but few regarding saddle points.","image":"535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f.svg","url":"Mountain_pass_theorem"}
