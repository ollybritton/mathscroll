{"title":"Lie algebra representation","summary":"In the mathematical field of representation theory, a Lie algebra representation or representation of a Lie algebra is a way of writing a Lie algebra as a set of matrices (or endomorphisms of a vector space) in such a way that the Lie bracket is given by the commutator. In the language of physics, one looks for a vector space V {\\displaystyle V} together with a collection of operators on V {\\displaystyle V} satisfying some fixed set of commutation relations, such as the relations satisfied by the angular momentum operators.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Lie_algebra_representation"}
