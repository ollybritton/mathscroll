{"title":"Quasitransitive relation","summary":"The mathematical notion of quasitransitivity is a weakened version of transitivity that is used in social choice theory and microeconomics. Informally, a relation is quasitransitive if it is symmetric for some values and transitive elsewhere.  The concept was introduced by Sen (1969) to study the consequences of Arrow's theorem.","image":"Quasitransitive_25_percent_margin.gif","url":"Quasitransitive_relation"}
