{"title":"Behnke–Stein theorem","summary":"In mathematics, especially several complex variables, the Behnke–Stein theorem states that a union of an increasing sequence G k ⊂ C n {\\displaystyle G_{k}\\subset \\mathbb {C} ^{n}} (i.e., G k ⊂ G k + 1 {\\displaystyle G_{k}\\subset G_{k+1}} ) of domains of holomorphy is again a domain of holomorphy. It was proved by Heinrich Behnke and Karl Stein in 1938.[1]","image":"11ce56efb9ea09025b631bfb11265dc2ab0a6bb8.svg","url":"Behnke–Stein_theorem"}
