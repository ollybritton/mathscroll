{"title":"Common logarithm","summary":"In mathematics, the common logarithm is the logarithm with base 10.[1] It is also known as the decadic logarithm and as the decimal logarithm, named after its base, or Briggsian logarithm, after Henry Briggs, an English mathematician who pioneered its use, as well as standard logarithm. Historically, it was known as logarithmus decimalis[2] or logarithmus decadis.[3] It is indicated by log(x),[4] log10 (x),[5] or sometimes Log(x) with a capital L (however, this notation is ambiguous, since it can also mean the complex natural logarithmic multi-valued function). On calculators, it is printed as \"log\", but mathematicians usually mean natural logarithm (logarithm with base e ≈ 2.71828) rather than common logarithm when they write \"log\". To mitigate this ambiguity, the ISO 80000 specification recommends that log10 (x) should be written lg(x), and loge (x) should be ln(x).","image":"lossless-page1-300px-APN2002_Table_1%2C_1000-1500.agr.tiff.png.webp","url":"Common_logarithm"}
