{"title":"Arboricity","summary":"The arboricity of an undirected graph is the minimum number of forests into which its edges can be partitioned. Equivalently it is the minimum number of spanning forests needed to cover all the edges of the graph. The Nash-Williams theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for when a graph is k-arboric.","image":"K44_arboricity.svg.png.webp","url":"Arboricity"}
