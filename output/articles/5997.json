{"title":"Gaussian period","summary":"In mathematics, in the area of number theory, a Gaussian period is a certain kind of sum of roots of unity. The periods permit explicit calculations in cyclotomic fields connected with Galois theory and with harmonic analysis (discrete Fourier transform). They are basic in the classical theory called cyclotomy. Closely related is the Gauss sum, a type of exponential sum which is a linear combination of periods.","image":"49991a4575e1f1c234d49134eb6643be40019848.svg","url":"Gaussian_period"}
