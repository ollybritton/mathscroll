{"title":"Boustrophedon transform","summary":"In mathematics, the boustrophedon transform is a procedure which maps one sequence to another. The transformed sequence is computed by an \"addition\" operation, implemented as if filling a triangular array in a boustrophedon (zigzag- or serpentine-like) mannerâ€”as opposed to a \"Raster Scan\" sawtooth-like manner.","image":"Boustrophedon_transform.svg.png.webp","url":"Boustrophedon_transform"}
