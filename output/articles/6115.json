{"title":"Genus field","summary":"In algebraic number theory, the genus field Γ(K) of an algebraic number field K is the maximal abelian extension of K which is obtained by composing an absolutely abelian field with K and which is  unramified at all finite primes of K.  The genus number of K is the degree [Γ(K):K] and the genus group is the Galois group of Γ(K) over K.","image":"901545bafbb3cf179a7b2b26c97be47c799040fc.svg","url":"Genus_field"}
