{"title":"T1 space","summary":"In topology and related branches of mathematics, a T1 space  is a topological space in which, for every pair of distinct points, each has a neighborhood not containing the other point.[1]  An R0 space is one in which this holds for every pair of topologically distinguishable points.  The properties T1 and R0 are examples of separation axioms.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"T1_space"}
