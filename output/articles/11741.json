{"title":"Palm calculus","summary":"In the study of stochastic processes, Palm calculus, named after Swedish teletrafficist Conny Palm, is the study of the relationship between probabilities conditioned on a specified event and time-average probabilities.  A Palm probability or Palm expectation, often denoted P 0 ( ⋅ ) {\\displaystyle P^{0}(\\cdot )} or E 0 [ ⋅ ] {\\displaystyle E^{0}[\\cdot ]} , is a probability or expectation conditioned on a specified event occurring at time 0.","image":"67be8349cfb47d5e7a4961e16d7553115dc2bcbe.svg","url":"Palm_calculus"}
