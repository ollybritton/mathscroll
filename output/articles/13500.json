{"title":"Rice's theorem","summary":"In computability theory, Rice's theorem states that all non-trivial semantic properties of programs are undecidable. A semantic property is one about the program's behavior (for instance, does the program terminate for all inputs), unlike a syntactic property (for instance, does the program contain an if-then-else statement). A property is non-trivial if it is neither true for every partial computable function, nor false for every partial computable function.","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"Rice's_theorem"}
