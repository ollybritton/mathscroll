{"title":"Degenerate bilinear form","summary":"In mathematics, specifically linear algebra, a degenerate bilinear form f (x, y ) on a vector space V is a bilinear form such that the map from V to V∗ (the dual space of V ) given by v ↦ (x ↦ f (x, v )) is not an isomorphism.  An equivalent definition when V is finite-dimensional is that it has a non-trivial kernel: there exist some non-zero x in V such that","image":"c2ce3a0f39594f0057b4ce0d1a007509281fd6ac.svg","url":"Degenerate_bilinear_form"}
