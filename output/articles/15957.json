{"title":"Transfer function matrix","summary":"In control system theory, and various branches of engineering, a transfer function matrix, or just transfer matrix is a generalisation of the transfer functions of single-input single-output (SISO) systems to multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems.[1]  The matrix relates the outputs of the system to its inputs.  It is a particularly useful construction for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems because it can be expressed in terms of the s-plane.","image":"948fbd63662fd7c83e6d215e34f7837647f30d6a.svg","url":"Transfer_function_matrix"}
