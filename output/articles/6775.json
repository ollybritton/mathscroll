{"title":"Hadamard code","summary":"The Hadamard code is an error-correcting code named after Jacques Hadamard that is used for error detection and correction when transmitting messages over very noisy or unreliable channels. In 1971, the code was used to transmit photos of Mars back to Earth from the NASA space probe Mariner 9.[1] Because of its unique mathematical properties, the Hadamard code is not only used by engineers, but also intensely studied in coding theory, mathematics, and theoretical computer science. The Hadamard code is also known under the names Walsh code, Walsh family,[2] and Walshâ€“Hadamard code[3] in recognition of the American mathematician Joseph Leonard Walsh.","image":"a8242689a132230c6c847ae901f6f32dba8181ab.svg","url":"Hadamard_code"}
