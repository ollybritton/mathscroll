{"title":"Stone–Čech compactification","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of general topology, Stone–Čech compactification (or Čech–Stone compactification[1]) is a technique for constructing a universal map from a topological space X to a compact Hausdorff space βX. The Stone–Čech compactification βX of a topological  space X is the largest, most general compact Hausdorff space \"generated\" by X, in the sense that any continuous map from X to a compact Hausdorff space factors through βX (in a unique way). If X is a Tychonoff space then the map from X to its image in βX is a homeomorphism, so X can be thought of as a (dense) subspace of βX; every other compact Hausdorff space that densely contains X is a quotient of βX. For general topological spaces X, the map from X to βX need not be injective.","image":"Stone_cech_diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Stone–Čech_compactification"}
