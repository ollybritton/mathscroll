{"title":"Freudenthal magic square","summary":"In mathematics, the Freudenthal magic square (or Freudenthalâ€“Tits magic square) is a construction relating several Lie algebras (and their associated Lie groups). It is named after Hans Freudenthal and Jacques Tits, who developed the idea independently. It associates a Lie algebra to a pair of division algebras A, B. The resulting Lie algebras have Dynkin diagrams according to the table at right. The \"magic\" of the Freudenthal magic square is that the constructed Lie algebra is symmetric in A and B, despite the original construction not being symmetric, though Vinberg's symmetric method gives a symmetric construction.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Freudenthal_magic_square"}
