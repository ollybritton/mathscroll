{"title":"Character sum","summary":"In mathematics, a character sum is a sum ∑ χ ( n ) {\\textstyle \\sum \\chi (n)} of values of a Dirichlet character χ modulo N, taken over a given range of values of n. Such sums are basic in a number of questions, for example in the distribution of quadratic residues, and in particular in the classical question of finding an upper bound for the least quadratic non-residue modulo N. Character sums are often closely linked to exponential sums by the Gauss sums (this is like a finite Mellin transform).","image":"b6bbdfece7a222e76336b243db020742c7bc8717.svg","url":"Character_sum"}
