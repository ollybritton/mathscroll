{"title":"Constant of integration","summary":"In calculus, the constant of integration, often denoted by C {\\displaystyle C} (or c {\\displaystyle c} ), is a constant term added to an antiderivative of a function f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} to indicate that the indefinite integral of f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} (i.e., the set of all antiderivatives of f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} ), on a connected domain, is only defined up to an additive constant.[1][2][3] This constant expresses an ambiguity inherent in the construction of antiderivatives.","image":"4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029.svg","url":"Constant_of_integration"}
