{"title":"Van den Berg–Kesten inequality","summary":"In probability theory, the van den Berg–Kesten (BK) inequality or van den Berg–Kesten–Reimer (BKR) inequality states that the probability for two random events to both happen, and at the same time one can find \"disjoint certificates\" to show that they both happen, is at most the product of their individual probabilities. The special case for two monotone events (the notion as used in the FKG inequality) was first proved by van den Berg and Kesten[1] in 1985, who also conjectured that the inequality holds in general, not requiring monotonicity. Reimer[2] later proved this conjecture.[3]: 159 [4]: 44  The inequality is applied to probability spaces with a product structure, such as in percolation problems.[5]: 829","image":"0d28839d27d6bfe7e137ebd7b0209dc904edf2b1.svg","url":"Van_den_Berg–Kesten_inequality"}
