{"title":"Elliptic operator","summary":"In the theory of partial differential equations,  elliptic operators are  differential operators that generalize the Laplace operator. They are defined by the condition that the coefficients of the highest-order derivatives be positive, which implies the key property that the principal symbol is invertible, or equivalently that there are no real characteristic directions.","image":"Laplace's_equation_on_an_annulus.svg.png.webp","url":"Elliptic_operator"}
