{"title":"Symmetrizable compact operator","summary":"In mathematics, a symmetrizable compact operator is a compact operator on a Hilbert space that can be composed with  a positive operator with trivial kernel to produce a self-adjoint operator. Such operators arose naturally in the work on integral operators of Hilbert, Korn, Lichtenstein and Marty required to solve elliptic boundary value problems on bounded domains in Euclidean space. Between the late 1940s  and early 1960s the techniques, previously developed as part of classical potential theory, were abstracted  within operator theory by various mathematicians, including M. G. Krein, William T. Reid, Peter Lax and Jean Dieudonn√©. Fredholm theory already implies that any element of the spectrum is an eigenvalue. The main results assert that the spectral theory of these operators is similar to that of compact self-adjoint operators: any spectral value is real; they form a sequence tending to zero; any generalized eigenvector is an eigenvector; and the eigenvectors span a dense subspace of the Hilbert space.","image":"15807f3bd78ececcc4a8384382d1f8e0cef618d2.svg","url":"Symmetrizable_compact_operator"}
