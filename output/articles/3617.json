{"title":"Cubic pyramid","summary":"In 4-dimensional geometry, the cubic pyramid is bounded by one cube on the base and 6 square pyramid cells which meet at the apex. Since a cube has a circumradius divided by edge length less than one,[1] the square pyramids can be made with regular faces by computing the appropriate height.","image":"Cubic_pyramid.png.webp","url":"Cubic_pyramid"}
