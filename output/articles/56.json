{"title":"2 21 polytope","summary":"In 6-dimensional geometry, the 221 polytope is a uniform 6-polytope, constructed within the symmetry of the E6 group. It was discovered by Thorold Gosset, published in his 1900 paper. He called it an 6-ic semi-regular figure.[1] It is also called the Schläfli polytope.","image":"Up_2_21_t0_E6.svg.png.webp","url":"2_21_polytope"}
