{"title":"Augmented hexagonal prism","summary":"In geometry, the augmented hexagonal prism is one of the Johnson solids (J54). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by augmenting a hexagonal prism by attaching a square pyramid (J1) to one of its equatorial faces. When two or three such pyramids are attached, the result may be a parabiaugmented hexagonal prism (J55), a metabiaugmented hexagonal prism (J56), or a triaugmented hexagonal prism (J57).","image":"Augmented_hexagonal_prism.png.webp","url":"Augmented_hexagonal_prism"}
