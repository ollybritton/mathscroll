{"title":"Real coordinate space","summary":"In mathematics, the real coordinate space of dimension n, denoted Rn or R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} , is the set of the n-tuples of real numbers, that is the set of all sequences of n real numbers. Special cases are called the real line R1 and the real coordinate plane R2. With component-wise addition and scalar multiplication, it is a real vector space, and its elements are called coordinate vectors.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Real_coordinate_space"}
