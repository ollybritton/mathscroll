{"title":"Jet bundle","summary":"In differential topology, the jet bundle is a certain construction that makes a new smooth fiber bundle out of a given smooth fiber bundle. It makes it possible to write differential equations on sections of a fiber bundle in an invariant form. Jets may also be seen as the coordinate free versions of Taylor expansions.","image":"06359bf782029772e5a4b722bd11790adf76f33f.svg","url":"Jet_bundle"}
