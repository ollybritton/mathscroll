{"title":"Cramér–Rao bound","summary":"In estimation theory and statistics, the Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) expresses a lower bound on the variance of unbiased estimators of a deterministic (fixed, though unknown) parameter, the variance of any such estimator is at least as high as the inverse of the Fisher information. Equivalently, it expresses an upper bound on the precision (the inverse of variance) of unbiased estimators: the precision of any such estimator is at most the Fisher information. The result is named in honor of Harald Cramér and C. R. Rao,[1][2][3] but has independently also been derived by Maurice Fréchet,[4] Georges Darmois,[5] as well as Alexander Aitken and Harold Silverstone.[6][7]","image":"6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af.svg","url":"Cramér–Rao_bound"}
