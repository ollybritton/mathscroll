{"title":"Homotopy groups of spheres","summary":"In the mathematical field of algebraic topology, the homotopy groups of spheres describe how spheres of various dimensions can wrap around each other. They are examples of topological invariants, which reflect, in algebraic terms, the structure of spheres viewed as topological spaces, forgetting about their precise geometry. Unlike homology groups, which are also topological invariants, the homotopy groups are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute.","image":"Hopf_Fibration.png.webp","url":"Homotopy_groups_of_spheres"}
