{"title":"Hypercovering","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular homotopy theory, a hypercovering (or hypercover) is a simplicial object that generalises the Čech nerve of a cover. For the Čech nerve of an open cover U → X {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {U}}\\to X} , one can show that if the space X {\\displaystyle X} is compact and if every intersection of open sets in the cover is contractible, then one can contract these sets and get a simplicial set that is weakly equivalent to X {\\displaystyle X} in a natural way. For the étale topology and other sites, these conditions fail. The idea of a hypercover is to instead of only working with n {\\displaystyle n} -fold intersections of the sets of the given open cover U {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {U}}} , to allow the pairwise intersections of the sets in U = U 0 {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {U}}={\\mathcal {U}}_{0}} to be covered by an open cover U 1 {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {U}}_{1}} , and to let the triple intersections of this cover to be covered by yet another open cover U 2 {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {U}}_{2}} , and so on, iteratively. Hypercoverings have a central role in étale homotopy and other areas where homotopy theory is applied to algebraic geometry, such as motivic homotopy theory.","image":"855cefbc98510f0d596e97b01242384388b0c024.svg","url":"Hypercovering"}
