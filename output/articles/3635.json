{"title":"Cuntz algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the Cuntz algebra O n {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}_{n}} , named after Joachim Cuntz, is the universal C*-algebra generated by n {\\displaystyle n} isometries of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space H {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {H}}} satisfying certain relations.[1] These algebras were introduced as the first concrete examples of a separable infinite simple C*-algebra, meaning as a Hilbert space, O n {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}_{n}} is isometric to the sequence space","image":"23c1482aadf309ab3fe04327732c45c8fb8b30c7.svg","url":"Cuntz_algebra"}
