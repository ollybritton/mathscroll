{"title":"Ramanujan theta function","summary":"In mathematics, particularly q-analog theory, the Ramanujan theta function generalizes the form of the Jacobi theta functions, while capturing their general properties.  In particular, the Jacobi triple product takes on a particularly elegant form when written in terms of the Ramanujan theta.  The function is named after mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.","image":"10b43ec4fef51df740e22d13f6ca75d527f032ee.svg","url":"Ramanujan_theta_function"}
