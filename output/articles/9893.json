{"title":"Maneuvering board","summary":"A maneuvering board is an aid to navigation. It is typically a writing surface with a pre-printed compass rose of polar coordinates about a central point, often including adjacent linear scales, and sometimes a time/speed/distance nomogram.[1] With the aid of a marking device, dividers, and parallel rulers, the maneuvering board provides a template for graphical solution of relative motion problems.[2]","image":"USS_Missouri_-_Combat_Engagement_Center_(8327944623).jpg.webp","url":"Maneuvering_board"}
