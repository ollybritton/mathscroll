{"title":"Differential graded Lie algebra","summary":"In mathematics, in particular abstract algebra and topology, a differential graded Lie algebra (or dg Lie algebra, or dgla) is a graded vector space with added Lie algebra and chain complex structures that are compatible. Such objects have applications in deformation theory[1] and rational homotopy theory.","image":"05e51ed234d311e1e4ea94122e2448763e316889.svg","url":"Differential_graded_Lie_algebra"}
