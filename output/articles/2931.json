{"title":"Comonotonicity","summary":"In probability theory, comonotonicity mainly refers to the perfect positive dependence between the components of a random vector, essentially saying that they can be represented as increasing functions of a single random variable. In two dimensions it is also possible to consider perfect negative dependence, which is called countermonotonicity.","image":"6d82c141ffc43427845c5557501c1f0fe1a3e1bb.svg","url":"Comonotonicity"}
