{"title":"Lévy family of graphs","summary":"In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, a Lévy family of graphs is a family of graphs Gn, n = 1, 2, 3, ..., which possess a certain type of \"compactness\" or \"tangledness\".  Many naturally occurring families of graphs are Lévy families.  Many mathematicians have noted this fact and have expressed surprise that it does not appear to have a ready explanation.","image":"e04ec3670b50384a3ce48aca42e7cc5131a06b12.svg","url":"Lévy_family_of_graphs"}
