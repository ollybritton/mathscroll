{"title":"Generalized method of moments","summary":"In econometrics and statistics, the generalized method of moments (GMM) is a generic method for estimating parameters in statistical models. Usually it is applied in the context of semiparametric models, where the parameter of interest is finite-dimensional, whereas the full shape of the data's distribution function may not be known, and therefore maximum likelihood estimation is not applicable.","image":"f6eb50bfdb16db36faaac02093b72fb142e45d30.svg","url":"Generalized_method_of_moments"}
