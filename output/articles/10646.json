{"title":"Monoclinic crystal system","summary":"In crystallography, the monoclinic crystal system is one of the seven crystal systems.  A crystal system is described by three vectors. In the monoclinic system, the crystal is described by vectors of unequal lengths, as in the orthorhombic system. They form a parallelogram prism. Hence two pairs of vectors are perpendicular (meet at right angles), while the third pair makes an angle other than 90Â°.","image":"Barytocalcite_1.png.webp","url":"Monoclinic_crystal_system"}
