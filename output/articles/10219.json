{"title":"Maximum and minimum","summary":"In mathematical analysis, the maximum (PL: maxima or maximums) and minimum (PL: minima or minimums) of a function, known generically as extremum (PL: extrema), are the largest and smallest value taken by the function, either within a given range (the local or relative extrema), or on the entire domain (the global or absolute extrema).[1][2][3] Pierre de Fermat was one of the first mathematicians to propose a general technique, adequality, for finding the maxima and minima of functions.","image":"Extrema_example_original.svg.png.webp","url":"Maximum_and_minimum"}
