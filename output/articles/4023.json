{"title":"Deutsche Mathematik","summary":"Deutsche Mathematik (German Mathematics) was a mathematics journal founded in 1936 by Ludwig Bieberbach and Theodor Vahlen. Vahlen was publisher on behalf of the German Research Foundation (DFG), and Bieberbach was chief editor. Other editors were Fritz Kubach, Erich Schönhardt, Werner Weber (all volumes), Ernst August Weiß (volumes 1–6), Karl Dörge, Wilhelm Süss (volumes 1–5), Günther Schulz (de), Erhard Tornier (volumes 1–4), Georg Feigl, Gerhard Kowalewski (volumes 2–6), Maximilian Krafft, Willi Rinow, Max Zacharias (volumes 2–5), and Oswald Teichmüller (volumes 3–7).[4] In February 1936, the journal was declared the official organ of the German Student Union (DSt) by its Reichsführer, and all local DSt mathematics departments were requested to subscribe and actively contribute.[5] In the 1940s, issues appeared increasingly delayed and bunched; the journal ended with a triple issue (due Dec 1942) in June 1944.[6][7]","image":"DeuMath1936_1.jpg.webp","url":"Deutsche_Mathematik"}
