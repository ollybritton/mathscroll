{"title":"Wilson's theorem","summary":"In algebra and number theory, Wilson's theorem states that a natural number n > 1 is a prime number if and only if the product of all the positive integers less than n is one less than a multiple of n.  That is (using the notations of modular arithmetic), the factorial ( n − 1 ) ! = 1 × 2 × 3 × ⋯ × ( n − 1 ) {\\displaystyle (n-1)!=1\\times 2\\times 3\\times \\cdots \\times (n-1)} satisfies","image":"267c350af599e3568a4933ff4ccc62f0da86db49.svg","url":"Wilson's_theorem"}
