{"title":"Wald test","summary":"In statistics, the Wald test (named after Abraham Wald) assesses constraints on statistical parameters based on the weighted distance between the unrestricted estimate and its hypothesized value under the null hypothesis, where the weight is the precision of the estimate.[1][2] Intuitively, the larger this weighted distance, the less likely it is that the constraint is true. While the finite sample distributions of Wald tests are generally unknown,[3] it has an asymptotic Ï‡2-distribution under the null hypothesis, a fact that can be used to determine statistical significance.[4]","image":"f0eaae56d74c5844e86caeed8ae205ff9e413bba.svg","url":"Wald_test"}
