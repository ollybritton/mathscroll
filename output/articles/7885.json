{"title":"Integrally closed domain","summary":"In commutative algebra, an integrally closed domain A is an integral domain whose integral closure in its field of fractions is A itself. Spelled out, this means that if x is an element of the field of fractions of A which is a root of a monic polynomial with coefficients in A, then x is itself an element of A. Many well-studied domains are integrally closed: fields, the ring of integers Z, unique factorization domains and regular local rings are all integrally closed.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Integrally_closed_domain"}
