{"title":"Spirolateral","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, a spirolateral is a polygon created by a sequence of fixed vertex internal angles and sequential edge lengths 1,2,3,â€¦,n which repeat until the figure closes. The number of repeats needed is called its cycles.[1] A simple spirolateral has only positive angles. A simple spiral approximates of a portion of an archimedean spiral. A general spirolateral allows positive and negative angles.","image":"Spirolateral_3_90.svg.png.webp","url":"Spirolateral"}
