{"title":"Quantum stochastic calculus","summary":"Quantum stochastic calculus is a generalization of stochastic calculus to noncommuting variables.[1] The tools provided by quantum stochastic calculus are of great use for modeling the random evolution of systems undergoing measurement, as in quantum trajectories.[2]: 148  Just as the Lindblad master equation provides a quantum generalization to the Fokker–Planck equation, quantum stochastic calculus allows for the derivation of quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDE) that are analogous to classical Langevin equations.","image":"7fa84d1efb44d911de3ffe9af5587ec2ecdaca7b.svg","url":"Quantum_stochastic_calculus"}
