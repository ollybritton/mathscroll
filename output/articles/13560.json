{"title":"Riemann–Roch theorem for smooth manifolds","summary":"In mathematics, a Riemann–Roch theorem for smooth manifolds is a version of results such as the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem or Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem (GRR) without a hypothesis making the smooth manifolds involved carry a complex structure. Results of this kind were obtained by Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch in 1959, reducing the requirements to something like a spin structure.","image":"70d4faab897515b34b5e7b81bbeda173d89c65cb.svg","url":"Riemann–Roch_theorem_for_smooth_manifolds"}
