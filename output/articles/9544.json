{"title":"List of small polyhedra by vertex count","summary":"In geometry, a polyhedron is a solid in three dimensions with flat faces and straight edges. Every edge has exactly two faces, and every vertex is surrounded by alternating faces and edges. The smallest polyhedron is the tetrahedron with 4 triangular faces, 6 edges, and 4 vertices. Named polyhedra primarily come from the families of platonic solids, Archimedean solids, Catalan solids, and Johnson solids, as well as dihedral symmetry families including the pyramids, bipyramids, prisms, antiprisms, and trapezohedrons.","image":"Tetrahedron.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_small_polyhedra_by_vertex_count"}
