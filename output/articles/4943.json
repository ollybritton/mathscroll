{"title":"Erdős sumset conjecture","summary":"In additive combinatorics, the Erdős sumset conjecture is a conjecture which states that if a subset A {\\displaystyle A} of the natural numbers N {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {N} } has a positive upper density then there are two infinite subsets B {\\displaystyle B} and C {\\displaystyle C} of N {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {N} } such that A {\\displaystyle A} contains the sumset B + C {\\displaystyle B+C} .[1][2] It was posed by Paul Erdős, and was proven in 2019 in a paper by Joel Moreira, Florian Richter and Donald Robertson.[3]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Erdős_sumset_conjecture"}
