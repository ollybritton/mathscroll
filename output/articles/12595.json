{"title":"Projection (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a projection is an idempotent mapping of a set (or other mathematical structure) into  a subset (or sub-structure). In this case, idempotent means that projecting twice is the same as projecting once.  The restriction to a subspace of a projection is also called a projection, even if the idempotence property is lost. An everyday example of a projection is the casting of shadows onto a plane (sheet of paper): the projection of a point is its shadow on the sheet of paper, and the projection (shadow) of a point on the sheet of paper is that point itself (idempotency). The shadow of a three-dimensional sphere is a closed disk.  Originally, the notion of projection was introduced in Euclidean geometry to denote the projection of the three-dimensional Euclidean space onto a plane in it, like the shadow example. The two main projections of this kind are:","image":"Proj-map.svg.png.webp","url":"Projection_(mathematics)"}
