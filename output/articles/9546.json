{"title":"List of statements independent of ZFC","summary":"The mathematical statements discussed below are provably independent of ZFC (the canonical axiomatic set theory of contemporary mathematics, consisting of the Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel axioms plus the axiom of choice), assuming that ZFC is consistent. A statement is independent of ZFC (sometimes phrased \"undecidable in ZFC\") if it can neither be proven nor disproven from the axioms of ZFC.","image":"Implication_Chains_of_Undecidable_ZFC_Statements.png.webp","url":"List_of_statements_independent_of_ZFC"}
