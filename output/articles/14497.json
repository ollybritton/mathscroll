{"title":"Skinny triangle","summary":"In trigonometry, a skinny triangle is a triangle whose height is much greater than its base. The solution of such triangles can be greatly simplified by using the approximation that the sine of a small angle is equal to that angle in radians. The solution is particularly simple for skinny triangles that are also isosceles or right triangles: in these cases the need for trigonometric functions or tables can be entirely dispensed with.","image":"Isosceles_skinny_triangle.svg.png.webp","url":"Skinny_triangle"}
