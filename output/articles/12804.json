{"title":"Quadratic Lie algebra","summary":"A quadratic Lie algebra is a Lie algebra together with a compatible symmetric bilinear form.  Compatibility means that it is invariant under the adjoint representation.  Examples of such are semisimple Lie algebras, such as su(n) and sl(n,R).","image":"E8Petrie.svg.png.webp","url":"Quadratic_Lie_algebra"}
