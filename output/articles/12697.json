{"title":"Pseudo-Riemannian manifold","summary":"In differential geometry, a pseudo-Riemannian manifold,[1][2] also called a semi-Riemannian manifold, is a differentiable manifold with a metric tensor that is everywhere nondegenerate.  This is a generalization of a Riemannian manifold in which the requirement of positive-definiteness is relaxed.","image":"Stereographic_projection_in_3D.svg.png.webp","url":"Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold"}
