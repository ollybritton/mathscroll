{"title":"Blackboard bold","summary":"Blackboard bold is a typeface style that is often used for certain symbols in mathematical texts, in which certain lines of the symbol (usually vertical or near-vertical lines) are doubled. The symbols usually denote number sets. One way of producing blackboard bold is to double-strike a character with a small offset on a typewriter. Thus, they are also referred to as double struck.[1]","image":"Blackboard_bold.svg.png.webp","url":"Blackboard_bold"}
