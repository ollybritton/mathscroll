{"title":"Frobenius pseudoprime","summary":"In number theory, a Frobenius pseudoprime is a pseudoprime, whose definition was inspired by the quadratic Frobenius test described by Jon Grantham in a 1998 preprint and published in 2000.[1][2] Frobenius pseudoprimes can be defined with respect to polynomials of degree at least 2, but they have been most extensively studied in the case of quadratic polynomials.[3][4]","image":"2ed3a7fc86c19d60634b959fda5027ca962a0485.svg","url":"Frobenius_pseudoprime"}
