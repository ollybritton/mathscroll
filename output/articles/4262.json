{"title":"Discrete series representation","summary":"In mathematics, a discrete series representation is an irreducible unitary representation of a locally compact topological group G that is a subrepresentation of the left regular representation of G on LÂ²(G).  In the Plancherel measure,  such representations have positive measure.  The name comes from the fact that they are exactly the representations that occur discretely in the decomposition of the regular representation.","image":"12a94d9f387f716011f0bd4a4b2d0b322f8862bc.svg","url":"Discrete_series_representation"}
