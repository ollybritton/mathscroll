{"title":"11-cell","summary":"In mathematics, the 11-cell (or hendecachoron) is a self-dual abstract regular 4-polytope (four-dimensional polytope). Its 11 cells are hemi-icosahedral. It has 11 vertices, 55 edges and 55 faces. It has Schläfli type {3,5,3}, with 3 hemi-icosahedra (Schläfli type {3,5}) around each edge.","image":"Hemi-icosahedron_coloured.svg.png.webp","url":"11-cell"}
