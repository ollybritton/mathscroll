{"title":"Reduction (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, reduction refers to the rewriting of an expression into a simpler form. For example, the process of rewriting a fraction into one with the smallest whole-number denominator possible (while keeping the numerator a whole number) is called \"reducing a fraction\". Rewriting a radical (or \"root\") expression with the smallest possible whole number under the radical symbol is called \"reducing a radical\". Minimizing the number of radicals that appear underneath other radicals in an expression is called denesting radicals.","image":"8f806f2894a95e3cb086737cf31206a58ffb7553.svg","url":"Reduction_(mathematics)"}
