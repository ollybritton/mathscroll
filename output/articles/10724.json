{"title":"Morse–Palais lemma","summary":"In mathematics, the Morse–Palais lemma is a result in the calculus of variations and theory of Hilbert spaces. Roughly speaking, it states that a smooth enough function near a critical point can be expressed as a quadratic form after a suitable change of coordinates.","image":"742f0e7e3b3ba51c77d265aa64bd3a456f86889c.svg","url":"Morse–Palais_lemma"}
