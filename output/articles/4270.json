{"title":"Discretization error","summary":"In numerical analysis, computational physics, and simulation, discretization error  is the error resulting from the fact that a function of a continuous variable is represented in the computer by a finite number of evaluations, for example, on a lattice.  Discretization error can usually be reduced by using a more finely spaced lattice, with an increased computational cost.","image":"89766c8ab859c6cef857ee0d62ab89ae7a119cc0.svg","url":"Discretization_error"}
