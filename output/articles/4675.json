{"title":"Eight-dimensional space","summary":"In mathematics, a sequence of n real numbers can be understood as a location in n-dimensional space. When n = 8, the set of all such locations is called 8-dimensional space. Often such spaces are studied as vector spaces, without any notion of distance. Eight-dimensional Euclidean space is eight-dimensional space equipped with the Euclidean metric.","image":"8-simplex_t0.svg.png.webp","url":"Eight-dimensional_space"}
