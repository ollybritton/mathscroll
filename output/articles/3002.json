{"title":"Complex affine space","summary":"Affine geometry, broadly speaking, is the study of the geometrical properties of lines, planes, and their higher dimensional analogs, in which a notion of \"parallel\" is retained, but no metrical notions of distance or angle are.  Affine spaces differ from linear spaces (that is, vector spaces) in that they do not have a distinguished choice of origin.  So, in the words of Marcel Berger, \"An affine space is nothing more than a vector space whose origin we try to forget about, by adding translations to the linear maps.\"[1]  Accordingly, a complex affine space, that is an affine space over the complex numbers, is like a complex vector space, but without a distinguished point to serve as the origin.","image":"a53b4e76242764d1bca004168353c380fef25258.svg","url":"Complex_affine_space"}
