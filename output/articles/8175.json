{"title":"Jacobson radical","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically ring theory, the Jacobson radical of a ring R {\\displaystyle R} is the ideal consisting of those elements in R {\\displaystyle R} that annihilate all simple right R {\\displaystyle R} -modules. It happens that substituting \"left\" in place of \"right\" in the definition yields the same ideal, and so the notion is left-right symmetric. The Jacobson radical of a ring is frequently denoted by J ( R ) {\\displaystyle J(R)} or rad ‚Å° ( R ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {rad} (R)} ; the former notation will be preferred in this article, because it avoids confusion with other radicals of a ring. The Jacobson radical is named after Nathan Jacobson, who was the first to study it for arbitrary rings in (Jacobson 1945).","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Jacobson_radical"}
