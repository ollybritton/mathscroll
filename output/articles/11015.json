{"title":"Network entropy","summary":"In network science,  the network entropy is a disorder measure derived from information theory to describe the level of randomness and the amount of information encoded in a graph.[1] It is a relevant metric to quantitatively characterize  real complex networks and can also be used to quantify network complexity[1][2]","image":"3ffad02f2fb07f5c5e5d7dbc6d5a43a77ab94866.svg","url":"Network_entropy"}
