{"title":"Square root of a 2 by 2 matrix","summary":"A square root of a 2×2 matrix M is another 2×2 matrix R such that M = R2, where R2 stands for the matrix product of R with itself.  In general, there can be zero, two, four, or even an infinitude of square-root matrices. In many cases, such a matrix R can be obtained by an explicit formula.","image":"d1d148d57ef365a39a784a3add39bfcc321727db.svg","url":"Square_root_of_a_2_by_2_matrix"}
