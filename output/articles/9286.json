{"title":"Lift (data mining)","summary":"In data mining and association rule learning, lift is a measure of the performance of a targeting model (association rule) at predicting or classifying cases as having an enhanced response (with respect to the population as a whole), measured against a random choice targeting model. A targeting model is doing a good job if the response within the target ( T {\\displaystyle T} ) is much better than the baseline ( B {\\displaystyle B} ) average for the population as a whole. Lift is simply the ratio of these values: target response divided by average response. Mathematically,","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Lift_(data_mining)"}
