{"title":"Kőnig's theorem (graph theory)","summary":"In the mathematical area of graph theory, Kőnig's theorem, proved by Dénes Kőnig (1931), describes an equivalence between the maximum matching problem and the minimum vertex cover problem in bipartite graphs. It was discovered independently, also in 1931, by Jenő Egerváry in the more general case of weighted graphs.","image":"Koenigs-theorem-graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Kőnig's_theorem_(graph_theory)"}
