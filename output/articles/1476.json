{"title":"Berlekamp–Welch algorithm","summary":"The Berlekamp–Welch algorithm, also known as the Welch–Berlekamp algorithm, is named for Elwyn R. Berlekamp and Lloyd R. Welch. This is a decoder algorithm that efficiently corrects errors in Reed–Solomon codes for an RS(n, k), code based on the Reed Solomon original view where a message m 1 , ⋯ , m k {\\displaystyle m_{1},\\cdots ,m_{k}} is used as coefficients of a polynomial F ( a i ) {\\displaystyle F(a_{i})} or used with Lagrange interpolation to generate the polynomial F ( a i ) {\\displaystyle F(a_{i})} of degree < k for inputs a 1 , ⋯ , a k {\\displaystyle a_{1},\\cdots ,a_{k}} and then F ( a i ) {\\displaystyle F(a_{i})} is applied to a k + 1 , ⋯ , a n {\\displaystyle a_{k+1},\\cdots ,a_{n}} to create an encoded codeword c 1 , ⋯ , c n {\\displaystyle c_{1},\\cdots ,c_{n}} .","image":"bf8db3abca3dd0274faf17f59383dc54b4ab774b.svg","url":"Berlekamp–Welch_algorithm"}
