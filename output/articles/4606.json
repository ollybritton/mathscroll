{"title":"Edge-of-the-wedge theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Bogoliubov's  edge-of-the-wedge theorem implies that holomorphic functions on two \"wedges\" with an \"edge\" in common are analytic continuations of each other provided they both give the same continuous function on the edge. It is used in quantum field theory to construct the analytic continuation of Wightman functions. The formulation and the first proof of the theorem were presented[1][2] by Nikolay Bogoliubov at the International Conference on Theoretical Physics, Seattle, USA (September, 1956) and also published in the book Problems in the Theory of Dispersion Relations.[3] Further proofs and generalizations of the theorem were given by R. Jost and H. Lehmann (1957),[4] F. Dyson (1958), H. Epstein (1960), and by other researchers.","image":"b3749e5cd50ee274eb73aea2ade8441687140a66.svg","url":"Edge-of-the-wedge_theorem"}
