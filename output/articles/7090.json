{"title":"Hereditarily finite set","summary":"In mathematics and set theory, hereditarily finite sets are defined as finite sets whose elements are all hereditarily finite sets. In other words, the set itself is finite, and all of its elements are finite sets, recursively all the way down to the empty set.","image":"7ac615766c39ad968616c73f9263bdc4b6c377e8.svg","url":"Hereditarily_finite_set"}
