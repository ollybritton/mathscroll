{"title":"Factorization of polynomials","summary":"In mathematics and computer algebra, factorization of polynomials or polynomial factorization  expresses a polynomial with coefficients in a given field or in the integers as the product of irreducible factors with coefficients in the same domain. Polynomial factorization is one of the fundamental components of computer algebra systems.","image":"fa05a1011a4258c86d55287e0305ecd526e44757.svg","url":"Factorization_of_polynomials"}
