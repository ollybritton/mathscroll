{"title":"Leavitt path algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Leavitt path algebra is a universal algebra constructed from a directed graph.  The Leavitt path algebras generalize the Leavitt algebras and may also be considered as algebraic analogues of the graph C*-algebras.  Leavitt path algebras were simultaneously introduced in 2005 by Gene Abrams and Gonzalo Aranda Pino[1] as well as by Pere Ara, Mar√≠a Moreno, and Enrique Pardo,[2] with neither of the two groups aware of the other's work.[3]  Leavitt path algebras have been investigated by dozens of mathematicians since their introduction, and in 2020 Leavitt path algebras were added to the Mathematics Subject Classification with code 16S88 under the general discipline of Associative Rings and Algebras.[4] The basic reference for this topic is the book by Gene Abrams, Pere Ara and Mercedes Siles Molina, Leavitt path algebras.[5]","image":"a74d566dca6fdbb8ef711b735f1b9e571d85ea22.svg","url":"Leavitt_path_algebra"}
