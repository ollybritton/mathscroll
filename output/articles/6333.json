{"title":"Glossary of symplectic geometry","summary":"This is a glossary of properties and concepts in symplectic geometry in mathematics. The terms listed here cover the occurrences of symplectic geometry both in topology as well as in algebraic geometry (over the complex numbers for definiteness). The glossary also includes notions from Hamiltonian geometry, Poisson geometry and geometric quantization.","image":"49373c3149412ab737714f4a2d7ece3ff9328eec.svg","url":"Glossary_of_symplectic_geometry"}
