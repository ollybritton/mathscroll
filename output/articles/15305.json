{"title":"Surface of general type","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a surface of general type is an algebraic surface with Kodaira dimensionÂ 2. Because of Chow's theorem any compact complex manifold of dimension 2 and with Kodaira dimension 2 will actually be an algebraic surface, and in some sense most surfaces are in this class.","image":"577fcf174271ee50814b61ef507398fa0128e267.svg","url":"Surface_of_general_type"}
