{"title":"Pseudovector","summary":"In physics and mathematics, a pseudovector (or axial vector) is a quantity that is defined as a function of some vectors or other geometric shapes, that resembles a vector, and behaves like a vector in many situations, but is changed into its opposite if the orientation of the space is changed, or an improper rigid transformation such as a reflection is applied to the whole figure. Geometrically, the direction of a reflected pseudovector is opposite to its mirror image, but with equal magnitude.  In contrast, the reflection of a true (or polar) vector is exactly the same as its mirror image.","image":"BIsAPseudovector.svg.png.webp","url":"Pseudovector"}
