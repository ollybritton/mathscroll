{"title":"Algebraic element","summary":"In mathematics, if L is a field extension of K, then an element a of L is called an algebraic element over K, or just algebraic over K, if there exists some non-zero polynomial g(x) with coefficients in K such that g(a) = 0. Elements of L which are not algebraic over K are called transcendental over K.","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"Algebraic_element"}
