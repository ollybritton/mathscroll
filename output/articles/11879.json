{"title":"Pathwidth","summary":"In graph theory, a path decomposition of a graph G is, informally, a representation of G as a \"thickened\" path graph,[1] and the pathwidth of G is a number that measures how much the path was thickened to formÂ G. More formally, a path-decomposition is a sequence of subsets of vertices of G such that the endpoints of each edge appear in one of the subsets and such that each vertex appears in a contiguous subsequence of the subsets,[2] and the pathwidth is one less than the size of the largest set in such a decomposition. Pathwidth is also known as interval thickness (one less than the maximum clique size in an interval supergraph of G), vertex separation number, or node searching number.[3]","image":"Pathwidth.JPG.webp","url":"Pathwidth"}
