{"title":"X-parameters","summary":"X-parameters are a generalization of S-parameters and are used for characterizing the amplitudes and relative phase of harmonics generated by nonlinear components under large input power levels.  X-parameters are also referred to as the parameters of the Poly-Harmonic Distortion (PHD) nonlinear behavioral model.","image":"Agilent-pna-x-advanced-design-system.jpg.webp","url":"X-parameters"}
