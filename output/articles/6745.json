{"title":"HP-32S","summary":"The HP-32S was a programmable RPN Scientific Calculator introduced by Hewlett-Packard in 1988 and discontinued in 1991.  It continued the tradition of the HP-15C programmable RPN Scientific Calculator. But some functions of the HP-15C were omitted (matrix calculations) and some were reduced in functionality (complex calculations), so to some extent it is more correct to say that the HP-32S expanded upon the HP-34C.  It supported complex math, statistics, probability, and other functions.","image":"Hp-32s_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"HP-32S"}
