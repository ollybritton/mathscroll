{"title":"Bose–Mesner algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Bose–Mesner algebra is a special set of matrices which arise from a combinatorial structure known as an association scheme, together with the usual set of rules for combining (forming the products of) those matrices, such that they form an associative algebra, or, more precisely, a unitary commutative algebra. Among these rules are:","image":"3e580967f68f36743e894aa7944f032dda6ea01d.svg","url":"Bose–Mesner_algebra"}
