{"title":"Exponential map (Riemannian geometry)","summary":"In Riemannian geometry, an exponential map is a map from a subset of a tangent space TpM of a Riemannian manifold (or pseudo-Riemannian manifold) M to M itself.  The (pseudo) Riemannian metric determines a canonical affine connection, and the exponential map of the (pseudo) Riemannian manifold is given by the exponential map of this connection.","image":"Azimuthal_Equidistant_N90.jpg.webp","url":"Exponential_map_(Riemannian_geometry)"}
