{"title":"Monotone class theorem","summary":"In measure theory and probability, the monotone class theorem connects monotone classes and 𝜎-algebras. The theorem says that the smallest monotone class containing an algebra of sets G {\\displaystyle G} is precisely the smallest 𝜎-algebra containing G . {\\displaystyle G.} It is used as a type of transfinite induction to prove many other theorems, such as Fubini's theorem.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Monotone_class_theorem"}
