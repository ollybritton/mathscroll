{"title":"Cyclotomic fast Fourier transform","summary":"The cyclotomic fast Fourier transform is a type of fast Fourier transform algorithm over finite fields.[1] This algorithm first decomposes a DFT into several circular convolutions, and then derives the DFT results from the circular convolution results. When applied to a DFT over G F ( 2 m ) {\\displaystyle GF(2^{m})} , this algorithm has a very low multiplicative complexity. In practice, since there usually exist efficient algorithms for circular convolutions with specific lengths, this algorithm is very efficient.[2]","image":"6e98fe9f49be74cc5e8cf1cbf19f2cd79dd284b2.svg","url":"Cyclotomic_fast_Fourier_transform"}
