{"title":"Category of topological spaces","summary":"In mathematics, the category of topological spaces, often denoted Top, is the category whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are continuous maps.  This is a category because the composition of two continuous maps is again continuous, and the identity function is continuous. The study of Top and of properties of topological spaces using the techniques of category theory is known as categorical topology.","image":"5c44fa295ce77229b0278408dde930ae036ae862.svg","url":"Category_of_topological_spaces"}
