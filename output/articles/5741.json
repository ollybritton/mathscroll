{"title":"Frequentist inference","summary":"Frequentist inference is a type of statistical inference based in frequentist probability, which treats “probability” in equivalent terms to “frequency” and draws conclusions from sample-data by means of emphasizing the frequency or proportion of findings in the data. Frequentist-inference underlies frequentist statistics, in which the well-established methodologies of statistical hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are founded.","image":"Fisher_iris_versicolor_sepalwidth.svg.png.webp","url":"Frequentist_inference"}
