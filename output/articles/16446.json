{"title":"Unknotting problem","summary":"In mathematics, the unknotting problem is the problem of algorithmically recognizing the unknot, given some representation of a knot, e.g., a knot diagram. There are several types of unknotting algorithms.  A major unresolved challenge is to determine if the problem admits a polynomial time algorithm; that is, whether the problem lies in the complexity class P.","image":"Unknots.svg.png.webp","url":"Unknotting_problem"}
