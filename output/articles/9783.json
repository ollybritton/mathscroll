{"title":"Lyapunov exponent","summary":"In mathematics, the Lyapunov exponent or Lyapunov characteristic exponent of a dynamical system is a quantity that characterizes the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories. Quantitatively, two trajectories in phase space with initial separation vector Î´ Z 0 {\\displaystyle \\delta \\mathbf {Z} _{0}} diverge (provided that the divergence can be treated within the linearized approximation) at a rate given by","image":"0197de2ff71c4f6e2610fd4b16975a847836980c.svg","url":"Lyapunov_exponent"}
