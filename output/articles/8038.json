{"title":"Irreducible representation","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in the representation theory of groups and algebras, an irreducible representation ( ρ , V ) {\\displaystyle (\\rho ,V)} or irrep of an algebraic structure A {\\displaystyle A} is a nonzero representation that has no proper nontrivial subrepresentation ( ρ | W , W ) {\\displaystyle (\\rho |_{W},W)} , with W ⊂ V {\\displaystyle W\\subset V} closed under the action of { ρ ( a ) : a ∈ A } {\\displaystyle \\{\\rho (a):a\\in A\\}} .","image":"f0c652e5ff39a9db4bd49b2e864089ca1574ab12.svg","url":"Irreducible_representation"}
