{"title":"Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem is one of several ergodic theorems. It can be seen as a generalization of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem.[1] Intuitively, the subadditive ergodic theorem is a kind of random variable version of Fekete's lemma (hence the name ergodic).[2] As a result, it can be rephrased in the language of probability, e.g. using a sequence of random variables and expected values.  The theorem is named after John Kingman.","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Kingman's_subadditive_ergodic_theorem"}
