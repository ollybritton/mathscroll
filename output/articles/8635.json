{"title":"Kazhdan–Margulis theorem","summary":"In Lie theory, an area of mathematics, the Kazhdan–Margulis theorem is a statement asserting that a discrete subgroup in semisimple Lie groups cannot be too dense in the group. More precisely, in any such Lie group there is a uniform neighbourhood of the identity element such that every lattice in the group has a conjugate whose intersection with this neighbourhood contains only the identity. This result was proven in the sixties by David Kazhdan and Grigory Margulis.[1]","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Kazhdan–Margulis_theorem"}
