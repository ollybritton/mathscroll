{"title":"Zsigmondy's theorem","summary":"In number theory, Zsigmondy's theorem, named after Karl Zsigmondy, states that if a > b > 0 {\\displaystyle a>b>0} are coprime integers, then for any integer n ≥ 1 {\\displaystyle n\\geq 1} , there is a prime number p (called a primitive prime divisor) that divides a n − b n {\\displaystyle a^{n}-b^{n}} and does not divide a k − b k {\\displaystyle a^{k}-b^{k}} for any positive integer k < n {\\displaystyle k<n} , with the following exceptions:","image":"dc57e5721ebc7b851b968ea2545913848bf7a01e.svg","url":"Zsigmondy's_theorem"}
