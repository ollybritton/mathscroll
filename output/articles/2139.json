{"title":"Calculus of functors","summary":"In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, the calculus of functors or Goodwillie calculus is a technique for studying functors by approximating them by a sequence of simpler functors; it generalizes the sheafification of a presheaf. This sequence of approximations is formally similar to the Taylor series of a smooth function, hence the term \"calculus of functors\".","image":"20bd9bf316b64e6cc95a0257b370c628558a00f9.svg","url":"Calculus_of_functors"}
