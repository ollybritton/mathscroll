{"title":"Atomic model (mathematical logic)","summary":"In model theory, a subfield of mathematical logic, an atomic model is a model such that the complete type of every tuple is axiomatized by a single formula. Such types are called principal types, and the formulas that axiomatize them are called complete formulas.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Atomic_model_(mathematical_logic)"}
