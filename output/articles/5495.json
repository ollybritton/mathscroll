{"title":"Fitting lemma","summary":"In mathematics, the Fitting lemma – named after the mathematician Hans Fitting – is a basic statement in abstract algebra. Suppose M is a module over some ring. If M is indecomposable and has finite length, then every endomorphism of M is either an automorphism or nilpotent.[1]","image":"97d86e0e9c7f79ca403ec0b9628f46947594cf2b.svg","url":"Fitting_lemma"}
