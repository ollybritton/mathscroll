{"title":"Projective linear group","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the group theoretic area of algebra, the projective linear group (also known as the projective general linear group or PGL) is the induced action of the general linear group of a vector space V on the associated projective space P(V). Explicitly, the projective linear group is the quotient group","image":"PSL-PGL.svg.png.webp","url":"Projective_linear_group"}
