{"title":"Alpha shape","summary":"In computational geometry, an alpha shape, or Î±-shape, is a family of piecewise linear simple curves in the Euclidean plane associated with the shape of a finite set of points.  They were first defined by Edelsbrunner, Kirkpatrick & Seidel (1983).  The alpha-shape associated with a set of points is a generalization of the concept of the convex hull, i.e. every convex hull is an alpha-shape but not every alpha shape is a convex hull.","image":"ScagnosticsBase.svg.png.webp","url":"Alpha_shape"}
