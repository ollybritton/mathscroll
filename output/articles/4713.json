{"title":"Elementary abelian group","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in group theory, an elementary abelian group is an abelian group in which all elements other than the identity have the same order.  This common order must be a prime number, and the elementary abelian groups in which the common order is p are a particular kind of p-group.[1][2] A group for which p = 2 (that is, an elementary abelian 2-group) is sometimes called a Boolean group.[3]","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Elementary_abelian_group"}
