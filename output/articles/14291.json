{"title":"Shift matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a shift matrix is a binary matrix with ones only on the superdiagonal or subdiagonal, and zeroes elsewhere. A shift matrix U with ones on the superdiagonal is an upper shift matrix.  The alternative subdiagonal matrix L is unsurprisingly known as a lower shift matrix. The (i,j):th component of U and L are","image":"0a333b4c87fb6a25f9b2c8c9f25f7cb4520a247a.svg","url":"Shift_matrix"}
