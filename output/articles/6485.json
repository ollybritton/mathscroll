{"title":"Graph reduction","summary":"In computer science, graph reduction implements an efficient version of non-strict evaluation, an evaluation strategy where the arguments to a function are not immediately evaluated. This form of non-strict evaluation is also known as lazy evaluation and used in functional programming languages. The technique was first developed by Chris Wadsworth in 1971.","image":"ba837a13f9d802c8dbc3c56e2f7117da41a37cef.svg","url":"Graph_reduction"}
