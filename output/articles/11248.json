{"title":"Notation for differentiation","summary":"In differential calculus, there is no single uniform notation for differentiation. Instead, various notations for the derivative of a function or variable have been proposed by various mathematicians. The usefulness of each notation varies with the context, and it is sometimes advantageous to use more than one notation in a given context. The most common notations for differentiation (and its opposite operation, the antidifferentiation or indefinite integration) are listed below.","image":"73eedac830d2e78d1961cccf2e970e7cbb0bf11b.svg","url":"Notation_for_differentiation"}
