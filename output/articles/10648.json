{"title":"Monodromy","summary":"In mathematics, monodromy is the study of how objects from mathematical analysis, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and differential geometry behave as they \"run round\" a singularity. As the name implies, the fundamental meaning  of monodromy comes from \"running round singly\". It is closely associated with covering maps and their degeneration into ramification; the aspect giving rise to monodromy phenomena is that certain functions we may wish to define fail to be single-valued as we \"run round\" a path encircling a singularity. The failure of monodromy can be measured by defining a monodromy group: a group of transformations acting on the data that encodes what happens as we \"run round\" in one dimension. Lack of monodromy is sometimes called polydromy.[1]","image":"Imaginary_log_analytic_continuation.png.webp","url":"Monodromy"}
