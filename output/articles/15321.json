{"title":"Suspension (topology)","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, the suspension of a topological space X is intuitively obtained by stretching X into a cylinder and then collapsing both end faces to points. One views X as \"suspended\" between these end points. The suspension of X is denoted by SX[1] or susp(X).[2]:â€Š76","image":"Suspension.svg.png.webp","url":"Suspension_(topology)"}
