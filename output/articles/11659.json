{"title":"Overcategory","summary":"In mathematics, specifically category theory, an overcategory (and undercategory) is a distinguished class of categories used in multiple contexts, such as with covering spaces (espace etale). They were introduced as a mechanism for keeping track of data surrounding a fixed object X {\\displaystyle X} in some category C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} . There is a dual notion of undercategory, which is defined similarly.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Overcategory"}
