{"title":"Proper convex function","summary":"In mathematical analysis, in particular the subfields of convex analysis and optimization, a proper convex function is an extended real-valued convex function with a non-empty domain, that never takes on the value − ∞ {\\displaystyle -\\infty } and also is not identically equal to + ∞ . {\\displaystyle +\\infty .}","image":"ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1.svg","url":"Proper_convex_function"}
