{"title":"Backtracking line search","summary":"In (unconstrained) mathematical optimization, a backtracking line search is a line search method to determine the amount to move along a given search direction. Its use requires that the objective function is differentiable and that its gradient is known.","image":"32adf004df5eb0a8c7fd8c0b6b7405183c5a5ef2.svg","url":"Backtracking_line_search"}
