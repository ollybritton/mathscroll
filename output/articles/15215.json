{"title":"Substitution tiling","summary":"In geometry, a tile substitution is a method for constructing highly ordered tilings.  Most importantly, some tile substitutions generate aperiodic tilings, which are tilings whose prototiles do not admit any tiling with translational symmetry. The most famous of these are the Penrose tilings. Substitution tilings are special cases of finite subdivision rules, which do not require the tiles to be geometrically rigid.","image":"85dfd2c5bc6206030c48d23e21db02c238a8d6e4.svg","url":"Substitution_tiling"}
