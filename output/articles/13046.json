{"title":"Radon measure","summary":"In mathematics (specifically in measure theory), a Radon measure, named after Johann Radon, is a measure on the Ïƒ-algebra of Borel sets of a Hausdorff topological space X that is finite on all compact sets, outer regular on all Borel sets, and inner regular on open sets.[1] These conditions guarantee that the measure is  \"compatible\" with the topology of the space, and most measures used in mathematical analysis and in number theory are indeed Radon measures.","image":"c843b1db65100567bae9940ee60786ade761f117.svg","url":"Radon_measure"}
