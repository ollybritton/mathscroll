{"title":"Homomorphism","summary":"In algebra, a homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces). The word homomorphism comes from the Ancient Greek language: ὁμός (homos) meaning \"same\" and μορφή (morphe) meaning \"form\" or \"shape\". However, the word was apparently introduced to mathematics due to a (mis)translation of German ähnlich meaning \"similar\" to ὁμός meaning \"same\".[1] The term \"homomorphism\" appeared as early as 1892, when it was attributed to the German mathematician Felix Klein (1849–1925).[2]","image":"20040a52d9391f2fe271f0aaa300bf7887a0c7b1.svg","url":"Homomorphism"}
