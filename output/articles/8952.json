{"title":"Lagrange's theorem (group theory)","summary":"In the mathematical field of group theory, Lagrange's theorem is a theorem that states that for any finite group G, the order (number of elements) of every subgroup of G divides the order of G. The theorem is named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange. The following variant states that for a subgroup H {\\displaystyle H} of a finite group G {\\displaystyle G} , not only is | G | / | H | {\\displaystyle |G|/|H|} an integer, but its value is the index [ G : H ] {\\displaystyle [G:H]} , defined as the number of left cosets of H {\\displaystyle H} in G {\\displaystyle G} .","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Lagrange's_theorem_(group_theory)"}
