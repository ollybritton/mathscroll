{"title":"Gluon field","summary":"In theoretical particle physics, the gluon field is a four-vector field characterizing the propagation of gluons in the strong interaction between quarks. It plays the same role in quantum chromodynamics as the electromagnetic four-potential in quantum electrodynamics –  the gluon field constructs the gluon field strength tensor.","image":"Feynmann_Diagram_Gluon_Radiation.svg.png.webp","url":"Gluon_field"}
