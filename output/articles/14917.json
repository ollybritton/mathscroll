{"title":"Standard basis","summary":"In mathematics, the standard basis (also called natural basis or canonical basis) of a coordinate vector space (such as R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} or C n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{n}} ) is the set of vectors whose components are all zero, except one that equals 1. For example, in the case of the Euclidean plane R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} formed by the pairs (x, y) of real numbers, the standard basis is formed by the vectors","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Standard_basis"}
