{"title":"Classification of Clifford algebras","summary":"In abstract algebra, in particular in the theory of nondegenerate quadratic forms on vector spaces, the structures of finite-dimensional real and complex Clifford algebras for a nondegenerate quadratic form have been completely classified. In each case, the Clifford algebra is algebra isomorphic to a full matrix ring over R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } , C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } , or H {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} } (the quaternions), or to a direct sum of two copies of such an algebra, though not in a canonical way. Below it is shown that distinct Clifford algebras may be algebra-isomorphic, as is the case of C l 2 , 0 ( R ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Cl} _{2,0}(\\mathbb {R} )} and C l 2 , 0 ( R ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Cl} _{2,0}(\\mathbb {R} )} , which are both isomorphic as rings to the ring of two-by-two matrices over the real numbers.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Classification_of_Clifford_algebras"}
