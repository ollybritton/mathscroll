{"title":"Generalized gamma distribution","summary":"The generalized gamma distribution is a continuous probability distribution with two shape parameters (and a scale parameter). It is a generalization of the gamma distribution which has one shape parameter (and a scale parameter). Since many distributions commonly used for parametric models in survival analysis (such as the exponential distribution, the Weibull distribution and the gamma distribution) are special cases of the generalized gamma, it is sometimes used to determine which parametric model is appropriate for a given set of data.[1] Another example is the half-normal distribution.","image":"GenGamma.png.webp","url":"Generalized_gamma_distribution"}
