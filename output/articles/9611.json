{"title":"Local optimum","summary":"In applied mathematics and computer science, a local optimum of an optimization problem is a solution that is optimal (either maximal or minimal) within a neighboring set of candidate solutions. This is in contrast to a global optimum, which is the optimal solution among all possible solutions, not just those in a particular neighborhood of values. Importantly, a global optimum is necessarily a local optimum, but a local optimum is not necessarily a global optimum.","image":"Local_search_attraction_basins.png.webp","url":"Local_optimum"}
