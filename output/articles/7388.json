{"title":"Homotopy group","summary":"In mathematics, homotopy groups are used in algebraic topology to classify topological spaces. The first and simplest homotopy group is the fundamental group, denoted Ï€ 1 ( X ) , {\\displaystyle \\pi _{1}(X),} which records information about loops in a space.  Intuitively, homotopy groups record information about the basic shape, or holes, of a topological space.","image":"b7de848ef6108d2b8e66c658e9990b4eabd16ec0.svg","url":"Homotopy_group"}
