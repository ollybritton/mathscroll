{"title":"Horosphere","summary":"In hyperbolic geometry, a horosphere (or parasphere) is a specific hypersurface in hyperbolic n-space. It is the boundary of a horoball, the limit of a sequence of increasing balls sharing (on one side) a tangent hyperplane and its point of tangency.  For n = 2 a horosphere is called a horocycle.","image":"633_honeycomb_one_cell_horosphere.png.webp","url":"Horosphere"}
