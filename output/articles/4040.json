{"title":"Diagonal matrix","summary":"In linear algebra, a diagonal matrix is a matrix in which the entries outside the main diagonal are all zero; the term usually refers to square matrices. Elements of the main diagonal can either be zero or nonzero. An example of a 2×2 diagonal matrix is [ 3 0 0 2 ] {\\displaystyle \\left[{\\begin{smallmatrix}3&0\\\\0&2\\end{smallmatrix}}\\right]} , while an example of a 3×3 diagonal matrix is [ 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] {\\displaystyle \\left[{\\begin{smallmatrix}6&0&0\\\\0&0&0\\\\0&0&0\\end{smallmatrix}}\\right]} . An identity matrix of any size, or any multiple of it (a scalar matrix), is a diagonal matrix.","image":"cbd1681ed0048aa1b28a2e9b5f6bb834b1cc3b14.svg","url":"Diagonal_matrix"}
