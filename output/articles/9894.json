{"title":"Manin conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the Manin conjecture describes the conjectural distribution of rational points on an algebraic variety relative to a suitable height function. It was proposed by Yuri I. Manin and his collaborators[1] in 1989 when they initiated a program with the aim of describing the distribution of rational points  on suitable algebraic varieties.","image":"Rational_points_of_bounded_height_outside_the_27_lines_on_Clebsch's_diagonal_cubic_surface.png.webp","url":"Manin_conjecture"}
