{"title":"Uniformizable space","summary":"In mathematics, a topological space X is uniformizable if there exists a uniform structure on X that induces the topology of X. Equivalently, X is uniformizable if and only if it is homeomorphic to a uniform space (equipped with the topology induced by the uniform structure).","image":"ad1116b863b27977d485e355a7de02cbfea7e33f.svg","url":"Uniformizable_space"}
