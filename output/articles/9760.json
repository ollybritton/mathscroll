{"title":"Ludwig Schläfli","summary":"Ludwig Schläfli (15 January 1814 – 20 March 1895) was a Swiss mathematician, specialising in geometry and complex analysis (at the time called function theory) who was one of the key figures in developing the notion of higher-dimensional spaces. The concept of multidimensionality is pervasive in mathematics, has come to play a pivotal role in physics, and is a common element in science fiction.","image":"Ludwig_Schläfli.jpg.webp","url":"Ludwig_Schläfli"}
