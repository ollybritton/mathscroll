{"title":"Hasse diagram","summary":"In order theory, a Hasse diagram (/ˈhæsə/; German: [ˈhasə]) is a type of mathematical diagram used to represent a finite partially ordered set, in the form of a drawing of its transitive reduction. Concretely, for a partially ordered set ( S , ≤ ) {\\displaystyle (S,\\leq )} one represents each element of S {\\displaystyle S} as a vertex in the plane and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from one vertex x {\\displaystyle x} to another vertex y {\\displaystyle y} whenever y {\\displaystyle y} covers x {\\displaystyle x} (that is, whenever x ≠ y {\\displaystyle x\\neq y} , x ≤ y {\\displaystyle x\\leq y} and there is no z {\\displaystyle z} distinct from x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} with x ≤ z ≤ y {\\displaystyle x\\leq z\\leq y} ). These curves may cross each other but must not touch any vertices other than their endpoints. Such a diagram, with labeled vertices, uniquely determines its partial order.","image":"d7e8fafe062081eef7510325dda0ea36c83a5a38.svg","url":"Hasse_diagram"}
