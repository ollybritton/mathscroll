{"title":"Unary operation","summary":"In mathematics, an unary operation is an operation with only one operand, i.e. a single input.[1] This is in contrast to binary operations, which use two operands.[2] An example is any function f : A → A, where A is a set. The function f is a unary operation on A.","image":"5e1cf3cc826afbb6558f53154a46b977f4f93af4.svg","url":"Unary_operation"}
