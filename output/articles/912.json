{"title":"Appert topology","summary":"In general topology, a branch of mathematics, the Appert topology, named for Antoine AppertÂ (1934), is a topology on the set X = {1, 2, 3, ...} of positive integers.[1] In the Appert topology, the open sets are those that do not contain 1, and those that asymptotically contain almost every positive integer.  The space X with the Appert topology is called the Appert space.[1]","image":"296eecc3a06f737a379b1e469e85aeed74ea248d.svg","url":"Appert_topology"}
