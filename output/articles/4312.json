{"title":"Distribution (differential geometry)","summary":"In differential geometry, a discipline within mathematics, a distribution on a manifold M {\\displaystyle M} is an assignment x ↦ Δ x ⊆ T x M {\\displaystyle x\\mapsto \\Delta _{x}\\subseteq T_{x}M} of vector subspaces satisfying certain properties. In the most common situations, a distribution is asked to be a vector subbundle of the tangent bundle T M {\\displaystyle TM} .","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Distribution_(differential_geometry)"}
