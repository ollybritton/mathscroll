In 2006, at the 25th International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, Spain he received the Fields Medal \"for his contributions to the development of stochastic Loewner evolution, the geometry of two-dimensional Brownian motion, and conformal field theory\".  He is a professor at ETH Zürich until May 2023, after which he will take up a professorship at the University of Cambridge.","image":"Wendelin_Werner.jpg.webp","url":"Wendelin_Werner"}
