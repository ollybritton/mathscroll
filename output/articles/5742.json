{"title":"Freshman's dream","summary":"The freshman's dream is a name sometimes given to the erroneous equation ( x + y ) n = x n + y n {\\displaystyle (x+y)^{n}=x^{n}+y^{n}} , where n {\\displaystyle n} is a real number (usually a positive integer greater than 1) and x , y {\\displaystyle x,y} are non-zero real numbers. Beginning students commonly make this error in computing the power of a sum of real numbers, falsely assuming powers distribute over sums.[1][2] When n = 2, it is easy to see why this is incorrect: (x + y)2 can be correctly computed  as x2 + 2xy + y2 using distributivity (commonly known by students as the FOIL method). For larger positive integer values of n, the correct result is given by the binomial theorem.","image":"c2d6e52abc033bc7a3e7615d3a7e1b8907f9e8c6.svg","url":"Freshman's_dream"}
