{"title":"Essentially unique","summary":"In mathematics, the term essentially unique is used to describe a weaker form of uniqueness, where an object satisfying a property is \"unique\" only in the sense that all objects satisfying the property are equivalent to each other. The notion of essential uniqueness presupposes some form of \"sameness\", which is often formalized using an equivalence relation.","image":"959905040c4110bae682eae9db986227c5506dcd.svg","url":"Essentially_unique"}
