{"title":"p-derivation","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically differential algebra, a p-derivation (for p a prime number) on a ring R, is a mapping from R to R that satisfies certain conditions outlined directly below. The notion of a p-derivation is related to that of a derivation in differential algebra.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"P-derivation"}
