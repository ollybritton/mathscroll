{"title":"Correlation","summary":"In statistics, correlation  or dependence  is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. Although in the broadest sense, \"correlation\" may indicate any type of association, in statistics it usually refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related. Familiar examples of dependent phenomena include the correlation between the height of parents and their offspring, and the correlation between the price of a good and the quantity the consumers are willing to purchase, as it is depicted in the so-called demand curve.","image":"Correlation_examples2.svg.png.webp","url":"Correlation"}
