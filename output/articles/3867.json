{"title":"Deconvolution","summary":"In mathematics, deconvolution is the operation inverse to convolution. Both operations are used in signal processing and image processing. For example, it may be possible to recover the original signal after a filter (convolution) by using a deconvolution method with a certain degree of accuracy.[1] Due to the measurement error of the recorded signal or image, it can be demonstrated that the worse the SNR, the worse the reversing of a filter will be; hence, inverting a filter is not always a good solution as the error amplifies. Deconvolution offers a solution to this problem.","image":"Deconvolution_of_an_astronomical_image.png.webp","url":"Deconvolution"}
