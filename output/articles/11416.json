{"title":"Opaque set","summary":"In discrete geometry, an opaque set is a system of curves or other set in the plane that blocks all lines of sight across a polygon, circle, or other shape. Opaque sets have also been called barriers, beam detectors, opaque covers, or (in cases where they have the form of a forest of line segments or other curves) opaque forests. Opaque sets were introduced by Stefan Mazurkiewicz in 1916,[1] and the problem of minimizing their total length was posed by Frederick Bagemihl in 1959.[2]","image":"Unit_Square_Opaque_Forest_Solutions.svg.png.webp","url":"Opaque_set"}
