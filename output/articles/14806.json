{"title":"Spin-weighted spherical harmonics","summary":"In special functions, a topic in mathematics, spin-weighted spherical harmonics are generalizations of the standard spherical harmonics and—like the usual spherical harmonics—are functions on the sphere.  Unlike ordinary spherical harmonics, the spin-weighted harmonics are U(1) gauge fields rather than scalar fields: mathematically, they take values in a complex line bundle.  The spin-weighted harmonics are organized by degree l, just like ordinary spherical harmonics, but have an additional spin weight s that reflects the additional U(1) symmetry.  A special basis of harmonics can be derived from the Laplace spherical harmonics Ylm, and are typically denoted by sYlm, where l and m are the usual parameters familiar from the standard Laplace spherical harmonics.  In this special basis, the spin-weighted spherical harmonics appear as actual functions, because the choice of a polar axis fixes the U(1) gauge ambiguity.  The spin-weighted spherical harmonics can be obtained from the standard spherical harmonics by application of spin raising and lowering operators.  In particular, the spin-weighted spherical harmonics of spin weight s = 0 are simply the standard spherical harmonics:","image":"bd50089598020efb70425d37dfbdeb2f99d8ba52.svg","url":"Spin-weighted_spherical_harmonics"}
