{"title":"Method of steepest descent","summary":"In mathematics, the method of steepest descent or saddle-point method is an extension of Laplace's method for approximating an integral, where one deforms a contour integral in the complex plane to pass  near a stationary point (saddle point), in roughly the direction of steepest descent or stationary phase. The saddle-point approximation is used with integrals in the complex plane, whereas Laplaceâ€™s method is used with real integrals.","image":"a5f68cc13ef2677ae774a2553d9fc4de5e0d6e05.svg","url":"Method_of_steepest_descent"}
