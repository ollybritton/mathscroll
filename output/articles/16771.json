{"title":"Weak order unit","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, an element x {\\displaystyle x} of a vector lattice X {\\displaystyle X} is called a weak order unit in X {\\displaystyle X} if x ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle x\\geq 0} and also for all y ∈ X , {\\displaystyle y\\in X,} inf { x , | y | } = 0 implies y = 0. {\\displaystyle \\inf\\{x,|y|\\}=0{\\text{ implies }}y=0.} [1]","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Weak_order_unit"}
