{"title":"Linearization","summary":"In mathematics, linearization is finding the linear approximation to a function at a given point. The linear approximation of a function is the first order Taylor expansion around the point of interest. In the study of dynamical systems, linearization is a method for assessing the local stability of an equilibrium point of a system of nonlinear differential equations or discrete dynamical systems.[1]  This method is used in fields such as engineering, physics, economics, and ecology.","image":"2311a6a75c54b0ea085a381ba472c31d59321514.svg","url":"Linearization"}
