{"title":"Drinfeld module","summary":"In mathematics, a Drinfeld module (or elliptic module) is roughly a special kind of module  over a ring of functions on a curve over a finite field, generalizing the Carlitz module. Loosely speaking, they provide a function field analogue of complex multiplication theory. A shtuka  (also called F-sheaf or chtouca) is a sort of generalization of a Drinfeld module, consisting roughly of a vector bundle over a curve, together with some extra structure identifying a \"Frobenius twist\" of the bundle with a \"modification\" of it.","image":"103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8.svg","url":"Drinfeld_module"}
