{"title":"Spider diagram","summary":"In mathematics, a unitary spider diagram adds existential points to an Euler or a Venn diagram. The points indicate the existence of an attribute described by the intersection of contours in the Euler diagram. These points may be joined together forming a shape like a spider. Joined points represent an \"or\" condition, also known as a logical disjunction.","image":"5c34352a1f15f657cb2b2332514e40a05365c813.svg","url":"Spider_diagram"}
