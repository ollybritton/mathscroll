{"title":"Mass point geometry","summary":"Mass point geometry, colloquially known as mass points, is a problem-solving technique in geometry which applies the physical principle of the center of mass to geometry problems involving triangles and intersecting cevians.[1]  All problems that can be solved using mass point geometry can also be solved using either similar triangles, vectors, or area ratios,[2] but many students prefer to use mass points.  Though modern mass point geometry was developed in the 1960s by New York high school students,[3] the concept has been found to have been used as early as 1827 by August Ferdinand MÃ¶bius in his theory of homogeneous coordinates.[4]","image":"Mass_points3.png.webp","url":"Mass_point_geometry"}
