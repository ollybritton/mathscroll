{"title":"Jarque–Bera test","summary":"In statistics, the Jarque–Bera test is a goodness-of-fit test of whether sample data have the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. The test is named after Carlos Jarque and Anil K. Bera. The test statistic is always nonnegative. If it is far from zero, it signals the data do not have a normal distribution.","image":"d4e5e1b491ad57619afa0771f9d30b651a95bb15.svg","url":"Jarque–Bera_test"}
