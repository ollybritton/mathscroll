{"title":"Total derivative","summary":"In mathematics, the total derivative of a function f at a point is the best linear approximation near this point of the function with respect to its arguments.  Unlike partial derivatives, the total derivative approximates the function with respect to all of its arguments, not just a single one.  In many situations, this is the same as considering all partial derivatives simultaneously.  The term \"total derivative\" is primarily used when f is a function of several variables, because when f is a function of a single variable, the total derivative is the same as the ordinary derivative of the function.[1]: 198–203","image":"1a4ffabb41c43db92055a8fd5be74cd7633756a9.svg","url":"Total_derivative"}
