{"title":"Induced homomorphism","summary":"In mathematics, especially in algebraic topology, an induced homomorphism is a homomorphism derived in a canonical way from another map.[1]  For example, a continuous map from a topological space X to a topological space Y induces a group homomorphism from the fundamental group of X to the fundamental group of Y.","image":"b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a.svg","url":"Induced_homomorphism"}
