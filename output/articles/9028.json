{"title":"Laplace–Stieltjes transform","summary":"The Laplace–Stieltjes transform, named for Pierre-Simon Laplace and Thomas Joannes Stieltjes, is an integral transform similar to the Laplace transform. For real-valued functions, it is the Laplace transform of a Stieltjes measure, however it is often defined for functions with values in a Banach space. It is useful in a number of areas of mathematics, including functional analysis, and certain areas of theoretical and applied probability.","image":"bc93b0d18b3e029c6a3ad048cc6695104b893434.svg","url":"Laplace–Stieltjes_transform"}
