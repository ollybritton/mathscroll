{"title":"IM 67118","summary":"IM 67118, also known as Db2-146, is an Old Babylonian clay tablet in the collection of the National Museum of Iraq that contains the solution to a problem in plane geometry concerning a rectangle with given area and diagonal.  In the last part of the text the solution is proved correct by means of the Pythagorean theorem.  The steps of the solution are believed to represent cut-and-paste geometry operations involving a diagram from which, it has been suggested, ancient Mesopotamians might, at an earlier time, have derived the Pythagorean theorem.","image":"Clay_tablet%2C_mathematical%2C_geometric-algebraic%2C_similar_to_the_Pythagorean_theorem._From_Tell_al-Dhabba'i%2C_Iraq._2003-1595_BCE._Iraq_Museum.jpg.webp","url":"IM_67118"}
