{"title":"Negative base","summary":"A negative base (or negative radix) may be used to construct a non-standard positional numeral system. Like other place-value systems, each position holds multiples of the appropriate power of the system's base; but that base is negative—that is to say, the base b is equal to −r for some natural number r (r ≥ 2).","image":"c65a13ddb73dc8b098416fe66aec6a72f8838ab1.svg","url":"Negative_base"}
