{"title":"Graph equation","summary":"In graph theory, Graph equations are equations in which the unknowns are graphs. One of the central questions of graph theory concerns the notion of isomorphism. We ask: When are two graphs the same? (i.e., graph isomorphism) The graphs in question may be expressed differently in terms of graph equations.[1]","image":"Complete_graph_K2.svg.png.webp","url":"Graph_equation"}
