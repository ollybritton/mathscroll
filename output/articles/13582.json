{"title":"Right triangle","summary":"A right triangle (American English) or right-angled triangle (British), or more formally an orthogonal triangle, formerly called a rectangled triangle[1] (Ancient Greek: ὀρθόσγωνία, lit. 'upright angle'),[2] is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle (that is, a 90-degree angle), i.e., in which two sides are perpendicular.  The relation between the sides and other angles of the right triangle is the basis for trigonometry.","image":"Rtriangle.svg.png.webp","url":"Right_triangle"}
