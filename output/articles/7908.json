{"title":"Intermediate Jacobian","summary":"In mathematics, the intermediate Jacobian of a compact Kähler manifold or Hodge structure is a complex torus that is a common generalization of the Jacobian variety of a curve and the  Picard variety and the Albanese variety. It is obtained by putting a complex structure on the torus H n ( M , R ) / H n ( M , Z ) {\\displaystyle H^{n}(M,\\mathbb {R} )/H^{n}(M,\\mathbb {Z} )} for n odd. There are several different natural ways to put a complex structure on this torus,  giving several different sorts of intermediate Jacobians, including one due to André Weil (1952) and one due to Phillip Griffiths (1968, 1968b). The ones constructed by Weil have natural polarizations if M is projective, and so are abelian varieties, while the ones constructed by Griffiths behave well under holomorphic deformations.","image":"83d2e0e9f0f3c6ba59c2206b36d87cc4df4b33a5.svg","url":"Intermediate_Jacobian"}
