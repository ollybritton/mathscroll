{"title":"Hesse configuration","summary":"In geometry, the Hesse configuration, introduced by Colin Maclaurin and studied by HesseÂ (1844),[1]  is a configuration of 9 points and 12 lines with three points per line and four lines through each point. It can be realized in the complex projective plane as the set of inflection points of an elliptic curve, but it has no realization in the Euclidean plane.","image":"Hesse_configuration.svg.png.webp","url":"Hesse_configuration"}
