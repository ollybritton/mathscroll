{"title":"Independent equation","summary":"An independent equation is an equation in a system of simultaneous equations which cannot be derived algebraically from the other equations.[1] The concept typically arises in the context of linear equations. If it is possible to duplicate one of the equations in a system by multiplying each of the other equations by some number (potentially a different number for each equation) and summing the resulting equations, then that equation is dependent on the others. But if this is not possible, then that equation is independent of the others.","image":"Three_Intersecting_Lines.svg.png.webp","url":"Independent_equation"}
