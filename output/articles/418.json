{"title":"Affine Grassmannian","summary":"In mathematics, the affine Grassmannian of an algebraic group G over a field k is an ind-scheme—a colimit of finite-dimensional schemes—which can be thought of as a flag variety for the loop group G(k((t))) and which describes the representation theory of the Langlands dual group LG through what is known as the geometric Satake correspondence.","image":"5e8fb8ae2c6f8349bcd67739203b6b707d22d146.svg","url":"Affine_Grassmannian"}
