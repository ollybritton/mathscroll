{"title":"Metric k-center","summary":"In graph theory, the metric k-center problem is a combinatorial optimization problem studied in theoretical computer science. Given n cities with specified distances, one wants to build k warehouses in different cities and minimize the maximum distance of a city to a warehouse. In graph theory, this means finding a set of k vertices for which the largest distance of any point to its closest vertex in the k-set is minimum. The vertices must be in a metric space, providing a complete graph that satisfies the triangle inequality.","image":"cb4d7a16bca9e216c0221b43a1c3377aa5e358b8.svg","url":"Metric_k-center"}
