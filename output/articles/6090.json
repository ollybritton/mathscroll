{"title":"Generalized renewal process","summary":"In the mathematical theory of probability, a generalized renewal process (GRP)  or G-renewal process is a stochastic point process used to model failure/repair behavior of repairable systems in reliability engineering. Poisson point process is a particular case of GRP.","image":"b8035dc50034511d6a56b4ee9d83afef23469c7e.svg","url":"Generalized_renewal_process"}
