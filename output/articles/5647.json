{"title":"Fractional programming","summary":"In mathematical optimization, fractional programming is a generalization of linear-fractional programming. The objective function in a fractional program is a ratio of two functions that are in general nonlinear. The ratio to be optimized often describes some kind of efficiency of a system.","image":"377c669dcb1ba8ef450066972c897d7e5dea6606.svg","url":"Fractional_programming"}
