{"title":"Mordell–Weil group","summary":"In arithmetic geometry, the Mordell–Weil group is an abelian group associated to any abelian variety A {\\displaystyle A} defined over a number field K {\\displaystyle K} , it is an arithmetic invariant of the Abelian variety. It is simply the group of K {\\displaystyle K} -points of A {\\displaystyle A} , so A ( K ) {\\displaystyle A(K)} is the Mordell–Weil group[1][2]pg 207. The main structure theorem about this group is the Mordell–Weil theorem which shows this group is in fact a finitely-generated abelian group. Moreover, there are many conjectures related to this group, such as the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture which relates the rank of A ( K ) {\\displaystyle A(K)} to the zero of the associated L-function at a special point.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Mordell–Weil_group"}
