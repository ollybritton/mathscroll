{"title":"Kummer's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Kummer's theorem is a formula for the exponent of the highest power of a prime number p that divides a given binomial coefficient.  In other words, it gives the p-adic valuation of a binomial coefficient. The theorem is named after Ernst Kummer, who proved it in a paper, (Kummer 1852).","image":"791ca04d664663c2d654fe929cfd3f1ff89fa2f9.svg","url":"Kummer's_theorem"}
