{"title":"Tunnel number","summary":"In mathematics, the tunnel number of a knot, as first defined by Bradd Clark, is a knot invariant, given by the minimal number of arcs (called tunnels) that must be added to the knot so that the complement becomes a handlebody.  The tunnel number can equally be defined for links.  The boundary of a regular neighbourhood of the union of the link and its tunnels forms a Heegaard splitting of the link exterior.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Tunnel_number"}
