{"title":"Cyclotruncated simplectic honeycomb","summary":"In geometry, the cyclotruncated simplectic honeycomb (or cyclotruncated n-simplex honeycomb) is a dimensional infinite series of honeycombs, based on the symmetry of the A ~ n {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {A}}_{n}} affine Coxeter group. It is given a Schl√§fli symbol t0,1{3[n+1]}, and is represented by a Coxeter-Dynkin diagram as a cyclic graph of n+1 nodes with two adjacent nodes ringed. It is composed of n-simplex facets, along with all truncated n-simplices.","image":"0dd3539f67ef780c40d9fa80a95b764637fa74af.svg","url":"Cyclotruncated_simplectic_honeycomb"}
