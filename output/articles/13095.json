{"title":"Random matrix","summary":"In probability theory and mathematical physics, a random matrix is a matrix-valued random variableâ€”that is, a matrix in which some or all elements are random variables. Many important properties of physical systems can be represented mathematically as matrix problems. For example, the thermal conductivity of a lattice can be computed from the dynamical matrix of the particle-particle interactions within the lattice.","image":"e4c4b8188957260df15d9873fac7c10112c11add.svg","url":"Random_matrix"}
