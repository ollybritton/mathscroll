{"title":"Belinfante–Rosenfeld stress–energy tensor","summary":"In mathematical physics, the Belinfante–Rosenfeld tensor is a modification of the energy–momentum tensor that is constructed from the canonical energy–momentum tensor and the spin current so as to be  symmetric yet still conserved.","image":"2756c77c5a33f87c93f884f92a8e1450cbee6848.svg","url":"Belinfante–Rosenfeld_stress–energy_tensor"}
