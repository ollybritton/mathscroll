{"title":"Coadjoint representation","summary":"In mathematics, the coadjoint representation K {\\displaystyle K} of a Lie group G {\\displaystyle G} is the dual of the adjoint representation. If g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} denotes the Lie algebra of G {\\displaystyle G} , the corresponding action of G {\\displaystyle G} on g âˆ— {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}^{*}} , the dual space to g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} , is called the coadjoint action. A geometrical interpretation is as the action by left-translation on the space of right-invariant 1-forms on G {\\displaystyle G} .","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Coadjoint_representation"}
