{"title":"Beltrami窶適lein model","summary":"In geometry, the Beltrami窶適lein model, also called the projective model, Klein disk model, and the Cayley窶適lein model, is a model of hyperbolic geometry in which points are represented by the points in the interior of the unit disk (or n-dimensional unit ball) and lines are represented by the chords, straight line segments with  ideal endpoints on the boundary sphere.","image":"Klein_model.svg.png.webp","url":"Beltrami窶適lein_model"}
