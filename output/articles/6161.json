{"title":"Geometric spanner","summary":"A geometric spanner or a t-spanner graph or a t-spanner was initially introduced as a weighted graph over a set of points as its vertices for which there is a t-path between any pair of vertices for a fixed parameter t. A t-path is defined as a path through the graph with weight at most t times the spatial distance between its endpoints. The parameter t is called the stretch factor or dilation factor of the spanner.[1]","image":"34109fe397fdcff370079185bfdb65826cb5565a.svg","url":"Geometric_spanner"}
