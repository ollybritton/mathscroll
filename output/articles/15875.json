{"title":"Toral subalgebra","summary":"In mathematics, a toral subalgebra is a Lie subalgebra of a general linear Lie algebra all of whose elements are semisimple (or diagonalizable over an algebraically closed field).[1] Equivalently, a Lie algebra is toral if it contains no nonzero nilpotent elements.  Over an algebraically closed field, every toral Lie algebra is abelian;[1][2] thus, its elements are simultaneously diagonalizable.","image":"b8f80a9d9b4cf9b0b6f562d5eff0f290da478ebe.svg","url":"Toral_subalgebra"}
