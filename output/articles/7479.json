{"title":"Hyperbolastic functions","summary":"The hyperbolastic functions, also known as hyperbolastic growth models, are mathematical functions that are used in medical statistical modeling. These models were originally developed to capture the growth dynamics of multicellular tumor spheres, and were introduced in 2005 by Mohammad Tabatabai, David Williams, and Zoran Bursac.[1] The precision of hyperbolastic functions in modeling real world problems is somewhat due to their flexibility in their point of inflection.[1][2] These functions can be used in a wide variety of modeling problems such as tumor growth, stem cell proliferation, pharma kinetics, cancer growth, sigmoid activation function in neural networks, and epidemiological disease progression or regression.[1][3][4]","image":"Figure_1_-_Hyperbolastic_Type_I.png.webp","url":"Hyperbolastic_functions"}
