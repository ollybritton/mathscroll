{"title":"Eta invariant","summary":"In mathematics, the eta invariant of a self-adjoint elliptic differential operator on a compact manifold is formally the number of positive eigenvalues minus the number of negative eigenvalues. In practice both numbers are often infinite so are defined using zeta function regularization. It was introduced by Atiyah,  Patodi, and  SingerÂ (1973, 1975) who used it to extend the Hirzebruch signature theorem to manifolds with boundary. The name comes from the fact that it is a generalization of the Dirichlet eta function.","image":"b5d2a795a52ce3fa4058ddcd4acd97ac257296ac.svg","url":"Eta_invariant"}
