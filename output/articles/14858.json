{"title":"Square orthobicupola","summary":"In geometry, the square orthobicupola is one of the Johnson solids (J28). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by joining two square cupolae (J4) along their octagonal bases, matching like faces. A 45-degree rotation of one cupola before the joining yields a square gyrobicupola (J29).","image":"Square_orthobicupola.png.webp","url":"Square_orthobicupola"}
