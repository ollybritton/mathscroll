{"title":"Néron differential","summary":"In mathematics, a Néron differential, named after André Néron, is an almost canonical choice of 1-form on an elliptic curve or abelian variety defined over a local field or global field. The Néron differential behaves well on the Néron minimal models.","image":"f4c91626d1e5a1e25d3e4e3be4eba70f8df713c9.svg","url":"Néron_differential"}
