{"title":"Kernel (linear algebra)","summary":"In mathematics, the kernel of a linear map, also known as the null space or nullspace, is the linear subspace of the domain of the map which is mapped to the zero vector.[1] That is, given a linear map L : V → W between two vector spaces V and W, the kernel of L is the vector space of all elements v of V such that L(v) = 0, where 0 denotes the zero vector in W,[2] or more symbolically:","image":"c337db9a49d95099138f6fa5a78f80baaf570538.svg","url":"Kernel_(linear_algebra)"}
