{"title":"Metrizable topological vector space","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, a metrizable (resp. pseudometrizable) topological vector space (TVS) is a TVS whose topology is induced by a metric (resp. pseudometric). An LM-space is an inductive limit of a sequence of locally convex metrizable TVS.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Metrizable_topological_vector_space"}
