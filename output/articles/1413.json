{"title":"Beck's theorem (geometry)","summary":"In discrete geometry, Beck's theorem is any of several different results, two of which are given below. Both appeared, alongside several other important theorems, in a well-known paper by JÃ³zsef Beck.[1] The two results described below primarily concern lower bounds on the number of lines determined by a set of points in the plane. (Any line containing at least two points of point set is said to be determined by that point set.)","image":"7422a53b1360b252486f26dcb2c06e42cf282e06.svg","url":"Beck's_theorem_(geometry)"}
