{"title":"Nagell–Lutz theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Nagell–Lutz theorem is a result in the diophantine geometry of elliptic curves, which describes rational torsion points on elliptic curves over the integers. It is named for Trygve Nagell and Élisabeth Lutz.","image":"9c1a29f462e52c49de587ab36c80243777ce8811.svg","url":"Nagell–Lutz_theorem"}
