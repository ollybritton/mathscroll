{"title":"Characteristic function (convex analysis)","summary":"In the field of mathematics known as convex analysis, the characteristic function of a set is a convex function that indicates the membership (or non-membership) of a given element in that set. It is similar to the usual indicator function, and one can freely convert between the two, but the characteristic function as defined below is better-suited to the methods of convex analysis.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Characteristic_function_(convex_analysis)"}
