{"title":"Double origin topology","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically general topology, the double origin topology is an example of a topology given to the plane R2 with an extra point, say 0*, added. In this case, the double origin topology gives a topology on the set X = R2 ∐ {0*}, where ∐ denotes the disjoint union.","image":"78d687a839777b83047c1d35982a984aa425a220.svg","url":"Double_origin_topology"}
