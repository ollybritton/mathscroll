{"title":"Interval arithmetic","summary":"Interval arithmetic (also known as interval mathematics, interval analysis or interval computation) is a mathematical technique used to mitigate rounding and measurement errors in mathematical computation by computing function bounds. Numerical methods involving interval arithmetic can guarantee reliable and mathematically correct results. Instead of representing a value as a single number, interval arithmetic represents each value as a range of possibilities.","image":"Set_of_curves_Outer_approximation.png.webp","url":"Interval_arithmetic"}
