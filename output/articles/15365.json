{"title":"Symmetric convolution","summary":"In mathematics, symmetric convolution is a special subset of convolution operations in which the convolution kernel is symmetric across its zero point. Many common convolution-based processes such as Gaussian blur and taking the derivative of a signal in frequency-space are symmetric and this property can be exploited to make these convolutions easier to evaluate.","image":"c9fd21fd068f39360982d7303f609bbcff9f424e.svg","url":"Symmetric_convolution"}
