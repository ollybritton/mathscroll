{"title":"Hyperbolic growth","summary":"When a quantity grows towards a singularity under a finite variation (a \"finite-time singularity\") it is said to undergo hyperbolic growth.[1] More precisely, the reciprocal function 1 / x {\\displaystyle 1/x} has a hyperbola as a graph, and has a singularity at 0, meaning that the limit as x â†’ 0 {\\displaystyle x\\to 0} is infinite: any similar graph is said to exhibit hyperbolic growth.","image":"a55fefc6f37f48a9b4414b09ad3b17dfa739d9e3.svg","url":"Hyperbolic_growth"}
