{"title":"Achilles number","summary":"An Achilles number is a number that is powerful but not a perfect power.[1] A positive integer n is a powerful number if, for every prime factor p of n, p2 is also a divisor. In other words, every prime factor appears at least squared in the factorization. All Achilles numbers are powerful. However, not all powerful numbers are Achilles numbers: only those that cannot be represented as mk, where m and k are positive integers greater than 1.","image":"Achilles_number_Cuisenaire_rods_72.png.webp","url":"Achilles_number"}
