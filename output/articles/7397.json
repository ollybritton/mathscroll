{"title":"Honeycomb (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a honeycomb is a space filling or close packing of polyhedral or higher-dimensional cells, so that there are no gaps. It is an example of the more general mathematical tiling or tessellation in any number of dimensions. Its dimension can be clarified as n-honeycomb for a honeycomb of n-dimensional space.","image":"Cubic_honeycomb.png.webp","url":"Honeycomb_(geometry)"}
