{"title":"Queue area","summary":"Queue areas are places in which people queue (first-come, first-served)  for goods or services. Such a group of people is known as a queue (British usage) or line (American usage), and the people are said to be waiting or standing in a queue or in line, respectively. (In the New York City area, the phrase on line is often used in place of in line.)[1] Occasionally, both the British and American terms are combined to form the term \"queue line\".[2][3]","image":"Female_voters_standing_in_a_queue_for_casting_their_votes_during_the_3rd_Phase_of_General_Elections-2014%2C_in_New_Delhi_on_April_10%2C_2014.jpg.webp","url":"Queue_area"}
