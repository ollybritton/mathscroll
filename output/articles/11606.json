{"title":"Orthonormal basis","summary":"In mathematics, particularly linear algebra, an orthonormal basis for an inner product space V with finite dimension is a basis for V {\\displaystyle V} whose vectors are orthonormal, that is, they are all unit vectors and orthogonal to each other.[1][2][3]  For example, the standard basis for a Euclidean space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} is an orthonormal basis, where the relevant inner product is the dot product of vectors.  The image of the standard basis under a rotation or reflection (or any orthogonal transformation) is also orthonormal, and every orthonormal basis for R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} arises in this fashion.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Orthonormal_basis"}
