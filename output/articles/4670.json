{"title":"Eigenmoments","summary":"EigenMoments[1] is a set of orthogonal, noise robust, invariant to rotation, scaling and translation and distribution sensitive moments. Their application can be found in signal processing and computer vision as descriptors of the signal or image. The descriptors can later be used for classification purposes.","image":"Concept_chart_for_EM.png.webp","url":"Eigenmoments"}
