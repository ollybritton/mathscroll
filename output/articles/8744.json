{"title":"Klein four-group","summary":"In mathematics, the Klein four-group is a group with four elements, in which each element is self-inverse (composing it with itself produces the identity) and in which composing any two of the three non-identity elements produces the third one. It can be described as the symmetry group of a non-square rectangle (with the three non-identity elements being horizontal and vertical reflection and 180-degree rotation), as the group of bitwise exclusive or operations on two-bit binary values, or more abstractly as Z2 Ã— Z2, the direct product of two copies of the cyclic group of order 2. It was named Vierergruppe (meaning four-group) by Felix Klein in 1884.[1] It is also called the Klein group, and is often symbolized by the letter V or as K4.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Klein_four-group"}
