{"title":"Ivar Ekeland","summary":"Ivar I. Ekeland (born 2 July 1944, Paris) is a French mathematician of Norwegian descent. Ekeland has written influential monographs and textbooks on nonlinear functional analysis, the calculus of variations, and mathematical economics, as well as popular books on mathematics, which have been published in French, English, and other languages. Ekeland is known as the author of Ekeland's variational principle and for his use of the Shapley–Folkman lemma in optimization theory. He has contributed to the periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems and particularly to the theory of Kreĭn indices for linear systems (Floquet theory).[4] Ekeland helped to inspire the discussion of chaos theory in Michael Crichton's 1990 novel Jurassic Park.[3]","image":"Animated_cycle.gif","url":"Ivar_Ekeland"}
