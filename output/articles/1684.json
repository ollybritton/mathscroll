{"title":"Bipolar cylindrical coordinates","summary":"Bipolar cylindrical coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from projecting the two-dimensional bipolar coordinate system in the perpendicular z {\\displaystyle z} -direction.  The two lines of foci F 1 {\\displaystyle F_{1}} and F 2 {\\displaystyle F_{2}} of the projected Apollonian circles are generally taken to be defined by x = âˆ’ a {\\displaystyle x=-a} and x = + a {\\displaystyle x=+a} , respectively, (and by y = 0 {\\displaystyle y=0} ) in the Cartesian coordinate system.","image":"bf368e72c009decd9b6686ee84a375632e11de98.svg","url":"Bipolar_cylindrical_coordinates"}
