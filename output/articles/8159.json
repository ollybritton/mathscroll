{"title":"Jacobi operator","summary":"A Jacobi operator, also known as Jacobi matrix, is a symmetric linear operator acting on sequences which is given by an infinite tridiagonal matrix. It is commonly used to specify systems of orthonormal polynomials over a finite, positive Borel measure. This operator is named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.","image":"30f5da85c0ac82572e622d7068b8cf4d0ac98fa7.svg","url":"Jacobi_operator"}
