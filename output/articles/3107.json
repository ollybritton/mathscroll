{"title":"Computable number","summary":"In mathematics, computable numbers are the real numbers that can be computed to within any desired precision by a finite, terminating algorithm. They are also known as the recursive numbers, effective numbers[1] or the computable reals or recursive reals. The concept of a computable real number was introduced by Emile Borel in 1912, using the intuitive notion of computability available at the time.[2]","image":"10%2C000_digits_of_pi_-_poster.svg.png.webp","url":"Computable_number"}
