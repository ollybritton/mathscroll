{"title":"Number theory","summary":"Number theory (or arithmetic or higher arithmetic in older usage) is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and arithmetic functions. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\"[1][note 1] Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of mathematical objects constructed from integers (for example, rational numbers), or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers).","image":"Spirale_Ulam_150.jpg.webp","url":"Number_theory"}
