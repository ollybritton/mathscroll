{"title":"Complete lattice","summary":"In mathematics, a complete lattice is a partially ordered set in which all subsets have both a supremum (join) and an infimum (meet). A lattice which satisfies at least one of these properties is known as a conditionally complete lattice. Specifically, every non-empty finite lattice is complete. Complete lattices appear in many applications in mathematics and computer science. Being a special instance of lattices, they are studied both in order theory and universal algebra.","image":"fcb6b18b94b2407719de5e793e1a4de97649dd40.svg","url":"Complete_lattice"}
