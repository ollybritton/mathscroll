{"title":"Kernel density estimation","summary":"In statistics, kernel density estimation (KDE) is the application of kernel smoothing for probability density estimation, i.e., a non-parametric method to estimate the probability density function of a random variable based on kernels as weights. KDE answers a fundamental data smoothing problem where inferences about the population are made, based on a finite data sample. In some fields such as signal processing and econometrics it is also termed the Parzenâ€“Rosenblatt window method,  after Emanuel Parzen and Murray Rosenblatt, who are usually credited with independently creating it in its current form.[1][2] One of the famous applications of kernel density estimation is in estimating the class-conditional marginal densities of data when using a naive Bayes classifier,[3][4] which can improve its prediction accuracy.[3]","image":"Kernel_density.svg.png.webp","url":"Kernel_density_estimation"}
