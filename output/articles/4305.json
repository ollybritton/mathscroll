{"title":"Distinguished space","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, distinguished spaces are topological vector spaces (TVSs) having the property that weak-* bounded subsets of their biduals (that is, the strong dual space of their strong dual space) are contained in the weak-* closure of some bounded subset of the bidual.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Distinguished_space"}
