{"title":"Serre duality","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics, Serre duality is a duality for the coherent sheaf cohomology of algebraic varieties, proved by Jean-Pierre Serre. The basic version applies to vector bundles on a smooth projective variety, but Alexander Grothendieck found wide generalizations, for example to singular varieties. On an n-dimensional variety, the theorem says that a cohomology group H i {\\displaystyle H^{i}} is the dual space of another one, H n − i {\\displaystyle H^{n-i}} . Serre duality is the analog for coherent sheaf cohomology of Poincaré duality in topology, with the canonical line bundle replacing the orientation sheaf.","image":"615a92cf445eebd5e7401387c3eef1ae09b0af14.svg","url":"Serre_duality"}
