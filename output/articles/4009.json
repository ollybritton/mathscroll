{"title":"Descriptive set theory","summary":"In mathematical logic, descriptive set theory (DST) is the study of certain classes of \"well-behaved\" subsets of the real line and other Polish spaces. As well as being one of the primary areas of research in set theory, it has applications to other areas of mathematics such as functional analysis, ergodic theory, the study of operator algebras and group actions, and mathematical logic.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Descriptive_set_theory"}
