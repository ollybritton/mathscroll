{"title":"Nori-semistable","summary":"In mathematics, a Nori semistable vector bundle is a particular type of vector bundle whose first definition has been first implicitly suggested by Madhav V. Nori,[1][2] as one of the main ingredients for the construction of the fundamental group scheme. The original definition given by Nori was obviously not called Nori semistable. Also, Nori's definition was different from the one suggested nowadays.[3] The category of Nori semistable vector bundles contains the Tannakian category of essentially finite vector bundles, whose naturally associated group scheme is the fundamental group scheme Ï€ 1 ( X , x ) {\\displaystyle \\pi _{1}(X,x)} .","image":"f51cddd9d7b2d6dba06932d169d8d748bce0b4f6.svg","url":"Nori-semistable"}
