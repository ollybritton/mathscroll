{"title":"Cauchy condensation test","summary":"In mathematics, the Cauchy condensation test, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a standard convergence test for infinite series. For a non-increasing sequence f ( n ) {\\displaystyle f(n)} of non-negative real numbers, the series ∑ n = 1 ∞ f ( n ) {\\textstyle \\sum \\limits _{n=1}^{\\infty }f(n)} converges if and only if the \"condensed\" series ∑ n = 0 ∞ 2 n f ( 2 n ) {\\textstyle \\sum \\limits _{n=0}^{\\infty }2^{n}f(2^{n})} converges. Moreover, if they converge, the sum of the condensed series is no more than twice as large as the sum of the original.","image":"c1c49fad1eccc4e9af1e4f23f32efdc3ac4da973.svg","url":"Cauchy_condensation_test"}
