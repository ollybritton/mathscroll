{"title":"Orthogonal basis","summary":"In mathematics, particularly linear algebra, an orthogonal basis for an inner product space V {\\displaystyle V} is a basis for V {\\displaystyle V} whose vectors are mutually orthogonal.  If the vectors of an orthogonal basis are normalized, the resulting basis is an orthonormal basis.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Orthogonal_basis"}
