{"title":"Petkovšek's algorithm","summary":"Petkovšek's algorithm (also Hyper) is a computer algebra algorithm that computes a basis of hypergeometric terms solution of its input linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients. Equivalently, it computes a first order right factor of linear difference operators with polynomial coefficients. This algorithm was developed by Marko Petkovšek in his PhD-thesis 1992.[1] The algorithm is implemented in all the major computer algebra systems.","image":"848eae66c9e74806f859bb724609bbf93dc91d52.svg","url":"Petkovšek's_algorithm"}
