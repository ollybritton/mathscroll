{"title":"Conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or a proposition that is proffered on a tentative basis without proof.[1][2][3] Some conjectures, such as the Riemann hypothesis (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (a conjecture until proven in 1995 by Andrew Wiles), have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.[4]","image":"RiemannCriticalLine.svg.png.webp","url":"Conjecture"}
