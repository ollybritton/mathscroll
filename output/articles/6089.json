{"title":"Generalized randomized block design","summary":"In randomized statistical experiments, generalized randomized block designs (GRBDs) are used to study the interaction between blocks and treatments. For a GRBD, each treatment is replicated at least two times in each block; this replication allows the estimation and testing of an interaction term in the linear model (without making parametric assumptions about a normal distribution for the error).[1]","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Generalized_randomized_block_design"}
