{"title":"José Mendieta","summary":"José Félix Mendieta Villarroel (born 15 November 1958) is a Bolivian mathematics professor, politician, and trade unionist who served as a member of the Chamber of Deputies from Cochabamba, representing circumscription 28 from 2010 to 2015. Though educated in pedagogy, Mendieta spent most of his career in commercial driving, climbing through the ranks of the sector's trade unions to eventually become general secretary of the Sacaba Mixed Motor Transport Union. Though traditionally conservative, under the leadership of figures like Mendieta, many of the country's drivers' unions reoriented themselves towards the left. The sector's alliance with the Movement for Socialism opened spaces for many of its representatives to attain elective office. Such was the case with Mendieta, who, from 2005 to 2009, served on Sacaba's municipal council before being elected to represent Cochabamba's drivers' unions in parliament.","image":"José_Félix_Mendieta_Villarroel_(Official_Photo%2C_2014)_Chamber_of_Deputies_of_Bolivia.png.webp","url":"José_Mendieta"}
