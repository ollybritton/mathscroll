{"title":"Conservative force","summary":"In physics, a conservative force is a force with the property that the total work done in moving a particle between two points is independent of the path taken.[1]  Equivalently, if a particle travels in a closed loop, the total work done (the sum of the force acting along the path multiplied by the displacement) by a conservative force is zero.[2]","image":"2c1d0f61f5c9b10e9cf7a208263f87f268ab92a1.svg","url":"A%2fConservative_force"}
