{"title":"Comodule over a Hopf algebroid","summary":"In mathematics, at the intersection of algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, there is the notion of a Hopf algebroid which encodes the information of a presheaf of groupoids whose object sheaf and arrow sheaf are represented by algebras. Because any such presheaf will have an associated site, we can consider quasi-coherent sheaves on the site, giving a topos-theoretic notion of modules. Dually[1]pg 2, comodules over a Hopf algebroid are the purely algebraic analogue of this construction, giving a purely algebraic description of quasi-coherent sheaves on a stack: this is one of the first motivations behind the theory.","image":"552e4054d9a85a10c2a9aa068588af53e4748591.svg","url":"Comodule_over_a_Hopf_algebroid"}
