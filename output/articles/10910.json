{"title":"Nagata–Smirnov metrization theorem","summary":"The Nagata–Smirnov metrization theorem in topology characterizes when a topological space is metrizable.  The theorem states that a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} is metrizable if and only if it is regular, Hausdorff and has a countably locally finite (that is, 𝜎-locally finite) basis.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Nagata–Smirnov_metrization_theorem"}
