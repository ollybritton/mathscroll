{"title":"Determinantal point process","summary":"In mathematics, a determinantal point process is a stochastic point process, the probability distribution of which is characterized as a determinant of some function. Such processes arise as important tools in random matrix theory, combinatorics, physics,[1] and wireless network modeling.[2][3][4]","image":"0ac0a4a98a414e3480335f9ba652d12571ec6733.svg","url":"Determinantal_point_process"}
