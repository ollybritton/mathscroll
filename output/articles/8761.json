{"title":"Kneser graph","summary":"In graph theory, the Kneser graph K(n, k) (alternatively KGn,k) is the graph whose vertices correspond to the k-element subsets of a set of n elements, and where two vertices are adjacent if and only if the two corresponding sets are disjoint. Kneser graphs are named after Martin Kneser, who first investigated them in 1956.","image":"Kneser_graph_KG(5%2C2).svg.png.webp","url":"Kneser_graph"}
