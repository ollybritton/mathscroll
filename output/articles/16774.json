{"title":"Weak topology","summary":"In mathematics, weak topology is an alternative term for certain initial topologies, often on topological vector spaces or spaces of linear operators, for instance on a Hilbert space. The term is most commonly used for the initial topology of a topological vector space (such as a normed vector space) with respect to its continuous dual. The remainder of this article will deal with this case, which is one of the concepts of functional analysis.","image":"1848c435e64864e9ad4efa7e46bd6bc900c35c99.svg","url":"Weak_topology"}
