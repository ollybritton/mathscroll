{"title":"Rokhlin's theorem","summary":"In 4-dimensional topology, a branch of mathematics, Rokhlin's theorem states that if a smooth, orientable, closed 4-manifold M has a spin structure (or, equivalently, the second Stiefelâ€“Whitney class w 2 ( M ) {\\displaystyle w_{2}(M)} vanishes), then the signature of its intersection form, a quadratic form on the second cohomology group H 2 ( M ) {\\displaystyle H^{2}(M)} , is divisible by 16. The theorem is named for Vladimir Rokhlin, who proved it in 1952.","image":"0d78be5fd5ab12de8dccaa73214cd66c85b522e6.svg","url":"Rokhlin's_theorem"}
