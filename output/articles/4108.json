{"title":"Diffiety","summary":"In mathematics, a diffiety (/dəˈfaɪəˌtiː/) is a geometrical object which plays the same role in the modern theory of partial differential equations that algebraic varieties play for algebraic equations, that is, to encode the space of solutions in a more conceptual way. The term was coined in 1984 by Alexandre Mikhailovich Vinogradov as portmanteau from differential variety.[1]","image":"ca99bcd9e0405f8bae3bc6b876b46549e6a3c254.svg","url":"Diffiety"}
