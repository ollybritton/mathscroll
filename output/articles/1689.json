{"title":"Biracks and biquandles","summary":"In mathematics, biquandles and biracks are sets with binary operations that generalize quandles and racks. Biquandles take, in the theory of virtual knots, the place that quandles occupy in the theory of classical knots. Biracks and racks have the same relation, while a biquandle is a birack which satisfies some additional conditions.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Biracks_and_biquandles"}
