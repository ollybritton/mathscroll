{"title":"Paracompact uniform honeycombs","summary":"In geometry, uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic space are tessellations of convex uniform polyhedron cells. In 3-dimensional hyperbolic space there are 23 Coxeter group families of paracompact uniform honeycombs, generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by ring permutations of the Coxeter diagrams for each family. These families can produce uniform honeycombs with infinite or unbounded facets or vertex figure, including ideal vertices at infinity, similar to the hyperbolic uniform tilings in 2-dimensions.","image":"H3_336_CC_center.png.webp","url":"Paracompact_uniform_honeycombs"}
