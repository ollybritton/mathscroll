{"title":"Singleton bound","summary":"In coding theory, the Singleton bound, named after Richard Collom Singleton, is a relatively crude upper bound on the size of an arbitrary block code C {\\displaystyle C} with block length n {\\displaystyle n} , size M {\\displaystyle M} and minimum distance d {\\displaystyle d} . It is also known as the Joshibound.[1] proved by Joshi (1958) and even earlier by Komamiya (1953).","image":"4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029.svg","url":"Singleton_bound"}
