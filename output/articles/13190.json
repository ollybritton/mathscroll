{"title":"Real structure","summary":"In mathematics, a real structure on a complex vector space is a way to decompose the complex vector space in the direct sum of two real vector spaces. The prototype of such a structure is the field of complex numbers itself, considered as a complex vector space over itself and with the conjugation map σ : C → C {\\displaystyle \\sigma :{\\mathbb {C} }\\to {\\mathbb {C} }\\,} , with σ ( z ) = z ¯ {\\displaystyle \\sigma (z)={\\bar {z}}} , giving the \"canonical\" real structure on C {\\displaystyle {\\mathbb {C} }\\,} , that is C = R ⊕ i R {\\displaystyle {\\mathbb {C} }={\\mathbb {R} }\\oplus i{\\mathbb {R} }\\,} .","image":"e1d0d88cd5523bb0ce357b6d1d5eb3030894d4f1.svg","url":"Real_structure"}
