{"title":"Distribution on a linear algebraic group","summary":"In algebraic geometry, given a linear algebraic group G over a field k, a distribution on it is a linear functional k [ G ] → k {\\displaystyle k[G]\\to k} satisfying some support condition. A convolution of distributions is again a distribution and thus they form the Hopf algebra on G, denoted by Dist(G), which contains the Lie algebra Lie(G) associated to G. Over a field of characteristic zero, Cartier's theorem says that Dist(G) is isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of G and thus the construction gives no new information. In the positive characteristic case, the algebra can be used as a substitute for the Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence and its variant for algebraic groups in the characteristic zero ; for example, this approach taken in (Jantzen 1987).","image":"c431bab6cd431deeed198198d8224e8c46e9a421.svg","url":"Distribution_on_a_linear_algebraic_group"}
