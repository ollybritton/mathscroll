{"title":"Kolmogorov space","summary":"In topology and related branches of mathematics, a topological space X is a T0 space or Kolmogorov space (named after Andrey Kolmogorov) if for every pair of distinct points of X, at least one of them has a neighborhood not containing the other. In a T0 space, all points are topologically distinguishable.","image":"4df50b4bfb1ee117d3876acd2e9cc85c39d6b849.svg","url":"Kolmogorov_space"}
