{"title":"Bipartite graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets U {\\displaystyle U} and V {\\displaystyle V} , that is every edge connects a vertex in U {\\displaystyle U} to one in V {\\displaystyle V} . Vertex sets U {\\displaystyle U} and V {\\displaystyle V} are usually called the parts of the graph. Equivalently, a bipartite graph is a graph that does not contain any odd-length cycles.[1][2]","image":"458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025.svg","url":"Bipartite_graph"}
