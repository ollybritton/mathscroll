{"title":"Sketch (mathematics)","summary":"In the mathematical theory of categories, a sketch is a category D, together with a set of cones intended to be limits and a set of cocones intended to be colimits.  A model of the sketch in a category C is a functor","image":"0229365de780b31cd6517cc782e8c4c80c7d40ae.svg","url":"Sketch_(mathematics)"}
