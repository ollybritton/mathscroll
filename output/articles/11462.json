{"title":"Orbifold notation","summary":"In geometry, orbifold notation (or orbifold signature) is a system, invented by the mathematician William Thurston and promoted by John Conway, for representing types of symmetry groups in two-dimensional spaces of constant curvature.  The advantage of the notation is that it describes these groups in a way which indicates many of the groups' properties: in particular, it follows William Thurston in describing the orbifold obtained by taking the quotient of Euclidean space by the group under consideration.","image":"3b6401d5d0155afb1406770d1eb80badce4e08ce.svg","url":"Orbifold_notation"}
