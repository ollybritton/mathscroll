{"title":"Geometric invariant theory","summary":"In mathematics, geometric invariant theory (or GIT) is a method for constructing quotients by group actions in algebraic geometry, used to construct moduli spaces. It was developed by David Mumford in  1965, using ideas from the paper (Hilbert 1893)  in  classical invariant theory.","image":"713a96ced05fbdb01df8de1f874e80f951f9fede.svg","url":"Geometric_invariant_theory"}
