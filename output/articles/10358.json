{"title":"Method of dominant balance","summary":"In mathematics, the method of dominant balance is used to determine the asymptotic behavior of solutions to an ordinary differential equation without fully solving the equation. The process is iterative, in that the result obtained by performing the method once can be used as input when the method is repeated, to obtain as many terms in the asymptotic expansion as desired.[1]","image":"ac83c619f1275b2ed84e018c866a34082cffdcf8.svg","url":"Method_of_dominant_balance"}
