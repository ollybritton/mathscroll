{"title":"Compound of six tetrahedra with rotational freedom","summary":"The compound of six tetrahedra with rotational freedom is a uniform polyhedron compound made of a symmetric arrangement of 6 tetrahedra, considered as antiprisms. It can be constructed by superimposing six tetrahedra within a cube, and then rotating them in pairs about the three axes that pass through the centres of two opposite cubic faces. Each tetrahedron is rotated by an equal (and opposite, within a pair) angle Î¸. Equivalently, a tetrahedron may be inscribed within each cube in the compound of six cubes with rotational freedom, in such a way as to preserve tetrahedral symmetry.","image":"UC01-6_tetrahedra.png.webp","url":"Compound_of_six_tetrahedra_with_rotational_freedom"}
