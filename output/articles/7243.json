{"title":"Hilbert class field","summary":"In algebraic number theory, the Hilbert class field E of a number field K is the maximal abelian unramified extension of K.   Its degree over K equals the class number of K and the Galois group of E over K is canonically isomorphic to the ideal class group of K using Frobenius elements for prime ideals in K.","image":"0854290031d92bf519f3ed79754edbe3eec1db77.svg","url":"Hilbert_class_field"}
