{"title":"Berezin integral","summary":"In mathematical physics, the Berezin integral, named after Felix Berezin, (also known as Grassmann integral, after Hermann Grassmann), is a way to define integration for functions of Grassmann variables (elements of the exterior algebra). It is not an integral in the Lebesgue sense; the word \"integral\" is used because the Berezin integral has properties analogous to the Lebesgue integral and because it extends the path integral in physics, where it is used as a sum over histories for fermions.","image":"79b5fbbc36e8db92ba9cc871db857f2f1a4de432.svg","url":"Berezin_integral"}
