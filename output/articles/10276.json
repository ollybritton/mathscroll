{"title":"Medial graph","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the medial graph of plane graph G is another graph M(G) that represents the adjacencies between edges in the faces of G.  Medial graphs were introduced in 1922 by Ernst Steinitz to study combinatorial properties of convex polyhedra,[1] although the inverse construction was already used by Peter Tait in 1877 in his foundational study of knots and links.[2][3]","image":"Medial_graph_example.svg.png.webp","url":"Medial_graph"}
