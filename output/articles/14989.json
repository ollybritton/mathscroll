{"title":"Steinberg formula","summary":"In mathematical representation theory, Steinberg's formula, introduced by Steinberg (1961), describes the multiplicity of an irreducible representation of a semisimple complex Lie algebra in a tensor product of two irreducible representations. It is a consequence of the Weyl character formula, and for the Lie algebra sl2 it is essentially the Clebsch–Gordan formula.","image":"13311aca18439ba2fb7489c4f6e055b54253a95d.svg","url":"Steinberg_formula"}
