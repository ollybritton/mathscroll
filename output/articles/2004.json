{"title":"Browder fixed-point theorem","summary":"The Browder fixed-point theorem is a refinement of the Banach fixed-point theorem for uniformly convex Banach spaces. It asserts that if K {\\displaystyle K} is a nonempty convex closed bounded set in uniformly convex Banach space and f {\\displaystyle f} is a mapping of K {\\displaystyle K} into itself such that ‖ f ( x ) − f ( y ) ‖ ≤ ‖ x − y ‖ {\\displaystyle \\|f(x)-f(y)\\|\\leq \\|x-y\\|} (i.e. f {\\displaystyle f} is non-expansive), then f {\\displaystyle f} has a fixed point.","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Browder_fixed-point_theorem"}
