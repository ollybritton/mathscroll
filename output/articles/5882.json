{"title":"Fuzzy sphere","summary":"In mathematics, the fuzzy sphere is one of the simplest and most canonical examples of non-commutative geometry. Ordinarily, the functions defined on a sphere form a commuting algebra. A fuzzy sphere differs from an ordinary sphere because the algebra of functions on it is not commutative. It is generated by spherical harmonics whose spin l is at most equal to some j. The terms in the product of two spherical harmonics that involve spherical harmonics with spin exceeding j are simply omitted in the product. This truncation replaces an infinite-dimensional commutative algebra by a j 2 {\\displaystyle j^{2}} -dimensional non-commutative algebra.","image":"9a6491dd93525723ddf12c98448e8e8bd3022122.svg","url":"Fuzzy_sphere"}
