{"title":"Faithful representation","summary":"In mathematics, especially in an area of abstract algebra known as representation theory, a faithful representation ρ of a group G on a vector space V is a linear representation in which different elements g of G are represented by distinct linear mappings ρ(g). In more abstract language, this means that the group homomorphism ρ : G → G L ( V ) {\\displaystyle \\rho :G\\to GL(V)} is injective (or one-to-one).","image":"82f269781bd98e77f7fcb16a1b6f31d04e645ec0.svg","url":"Faithful_representation"}
