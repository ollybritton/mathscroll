{"title":"Square gyrobicupola","summary":"In geometry, the square gyrobicupola is one of the Johnson solids (J29). Like the square orthobicupola (J28), it can be obtained by joining two square cupolae (J4) along their bases. The difference is that in this solid, the two halves are rotated 45 degrees with respect to one another.","image":"Square_gyrobicupola.png.webp","url":"Square_gyrobicupola"}
