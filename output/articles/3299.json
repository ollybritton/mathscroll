{"title":"Contact process (mathematics)","summary":"The contact process is a stochastic process used to model population growth on the set of sites S {\\displaystyle S} of a graph in which occupied sites become vacant at a constant rate, while vacant sites become occupied at a rate proportional to the number of occupied neighboring sites. Therefore, if we denote by λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } the proportionality constant, each site remains occupied for a random time period which is exponentially distributed parameter 1 and places descendants at every vacant neighboring site at times of events of a  Poisson process parameter λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } during this period. All processes are independent of one another and of the random period of time sites remains occupied. The contact process can also be interpreted as a model for the spread of an infection by thinking of particles as a bacterium spreading over individuals that are positioned at the sites of S {\\displaystyle S} , occupied sites correspond to infected individuals, whereas vacant correspond to healthy ones.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Contact_process_(mathematics)"}
