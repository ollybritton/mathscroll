{"title":"Branching random walk","summary":"In probability theory, a branching random walk is a stochastic process that generalizes both the concept of a random walk and of a branching process.  At every generation (a point of discrete time), a branching random walk's value is a set of elements that are located in some linear space, such as the real line. Each element of a given generation can have several descendants in the next generation. The location of any descendant is the sum of its parent's location and a random variable.","image":"Branching_random_walk_example.svg.png.webp","url":"Branching_random_walk"}
