{"title":"Index set","summary":"In mathematics, an index set is a set whose members label (or index) members of another set.[1][2] For instance, if the elements of a set A may be indexed or labeled by means of the elements of a set J, then J is an index set.  The indexing consists of a surjective function from J onto A, and the indexed collection is typically called an (indexed) family, often written as {Aj}jâˆˆJ.","image":"663d50b2a4129fafc0e20100b18cf6554241efd2.svg","url":"Index_set"}
