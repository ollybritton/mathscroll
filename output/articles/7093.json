{"title":"Hereditary ring","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra known as module theory, a ring R is called hereditary if all submodules of projective modules over R are again projective.  If this is required only for finitely generated submodules, it is called semihereditary.","image":"11768bc974a23977583ab31381f36fbfb62e22ba.svg","url":"Hereditary_ring"}
