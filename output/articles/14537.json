{"title":"Small complex icosidodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the small complex icosidodecahedron is a degenerate uniform star polyhedron. Its edges are doubled, making it degenerate. The star has 32 faces (20 triangles and 12 pentagons), 60 (doubled) edges and 12 vertices and 4 sharing faces. The faces in it are considered as two overlapping edges as topological polyhedron.","image":"Small_complex_icosidodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Small_complex_icosidodecahedron"}
