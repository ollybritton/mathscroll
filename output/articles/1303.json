{"title":"Banach–Mazur compactum","summary":"In the mathematical study of functional analysis, the Banach–Mazur distance is a way to define a distance on the set Q ( n ) {\\displaystyle Q(n)} of n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional normed spaces. With this distance, the set of isometry classes of n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional normed spaces becomes a compact metric space, called the Banach–Mazur compactum.","image":"39f1477b71cf9622d2d860e02dbbcffaeac2f13a.svg","url":"Banach–Mazur_compactum"}
