{"title":"Riemann sum","summary":"In mathematics, a Riemann sum is a certain kind of approximation of an integral by a finite sum. It is named after nineteenth century German mathematician Bernhard Riemann. One very common application is approximating the area of functions or lines on a graph, but also the length of curves and other approximations.","image":"Riemann_sum_convergence.png.webp","url":"Riemann_sum"}
