{"title":"Convex position","summary":"In discrete and computational geometry, a set of points in the Euclidean plane or a higher-dimensional Euclidean space is said to be in convex position or convex independent if none of the points can be represented as a convex combination of the others.[1] A finite set of points is in convex position if all of the points are vertices of their convex hull.[1] More generally, a family of convex sets is said to be in convex position if they are pairwise disjoint and none of them is contained in the convex hull of the others.[2]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Convex_position"}
