{"title":"Biharmonic equation","summary":"In mathematics, the biharmonic equation is a fourth-order partial differential equation which arises in areas of continuum mechanics, including linear elasticity theory and the solution of Stokes flows. Specifically, it is used in the modeling of thin structures that react elastically to external forces.","image":"7837980077399ce1fd834bb93cdf4384cda7180f.svg","url":"Biharmonic_equation"}
