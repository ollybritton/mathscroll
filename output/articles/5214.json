{"title":"Exterior angle theorem","summary":"The exterior angle theorem is Proposition 1.16 in Euclid's Elements, which states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is greater than either of the measures of the remote interior angles. This is a fundamental result in absolute geometry because its proof does not depend upon the parallel postulate.","image":"Remint3.svg.png.webp","url":"Exterior_angle_theorem"}
