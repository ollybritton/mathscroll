{"title":"Mapping class group of a surface","summary":"In mathematics, and more precisely in topology, the mapping class group of a surface, sometimes called the modular group or Teichm√ºller modular group, is the group of homeomorphisms of the surface viewed up to continuous (in the compact-open topology) deformation. It is of fundamental importance for the study of 3-manifolds via their embedded surfaces and is also studied in algebraic geometry in relation to moduli problems for curves.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Mapping_class_group_of_a_surface"}
