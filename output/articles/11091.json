He went to school at Evelpidon and studied in France at the École des ponts Paris Tech and École Polytechnique.  His professors in France included Joseph Bertrand and Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant.  While in France he was exposed to the complex mathematics prevalent at the time.  He wrote papers on geometry and kinematics.  He was exposed to the works of Jacques Charles François Sturm, Giovanni Fagnano, Colin Maclaurin, Joseph Bertrand, and Jacques Antoine Charles Bresse.  He integrated some of their works into his mathematical literature.  He participated in the Cretan revolt in 1866 and was the Commander of the 174th Battalion of Verville during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870.  He became a professor at University of Athens in 1871.
