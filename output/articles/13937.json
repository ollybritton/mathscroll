{"title":"Schauder estimates","summary":"In mathematics, the Schauder estimates are a collection of results due to Juliusz Schauder (1934, 1937) concerning the regularity of solutions to linear, uniformly elliptic partial differential equations. The estimates say that when the equation has appropriately smooth terms and appropriately smooth solutions, then the Hölder norm of the solution can be controlled in terms of the Hölder norms for the coefficient and source terms. Since these estimates assume by hypothesis the existence of a solution, they are called a priori estimates.","image":"1ad91fe284658d1b7dbf0c3f41c2126690472132.svg","url":"Schauder_estimates"}
