{"title":"Fermat's Last Theorem","summary":"In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n = 1 and n = 2 have been known since antiquity to have infinitely many solutions.[1]","image":"Diophantus-II-8-Fermat.jpg.webp","url":"Fermat's_Last_Theorem"}
