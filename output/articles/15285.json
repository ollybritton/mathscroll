{"title":"Superreal number","summary":"In abstract algebra, the superreal numbers are a class of extensions of the real numbers, introduced by H. Garth Dales and W. Hugh Woodin as a generalization of the hyperreal numbers and primarily of interest in non-standard analysis, model theory, and the study of Banach algebras.  The field of superreals is itself a subfield of the surreal numbers.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Superreal_number"}
