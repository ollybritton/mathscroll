{"title":"Category of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces","summary":"In mathematics, the category of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces CGWH is one of typically used categories in algebraic topology as a substitute for the category of topological spaces, as the latter lacks some of the pleasant properties one would desire. There is also such a category for based spaces, defined by requiring maps to preserve the base points.[1]","image":"1baf66d9961b618a143ac8e28d5b8df7bed3835e.svg","url":"Category_of_compactly_generated_weak_Hausdorff_spaces"}
