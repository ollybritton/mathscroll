{"title":"Heegner number","summary":"In number theory, a Heegner number (as termed by Conway and Guy) is a square-free positive integer d such that the imaginary quadratic field Q [ âˆ’ d ] {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} \\left[{\\sqrt {-d}}\\right]} has class number 1. Equivalently, its ring of integers has unique factorization.[1]","image":"0a585fc5adbd9245a7b1d09c1d205199a7db58f3.svg","url":"Heegner_number"}
