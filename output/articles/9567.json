{"title":"List of uniform polyhedra by vertex figure","summary":"There are many relations among the uniform polyhedra.[1][2][3] Some are obtained by truncating the vertices of the regular or quasi-regular polyhedron. Others share the same vertices and edges as other polyhedron. The grouping below exhibit some of these relations.","image":"Vertex_figures.png.webp","url":"List_of_uniform_polyhedra_by_vertex_figure"}
