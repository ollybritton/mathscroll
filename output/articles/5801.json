{"title":"Fuchsian model","summary":"In mathematics, a Fuchsian model is a representation of a hyperbolic Riemann surface R as a quotient of the upper half-plane H by a Fuchsian group. Every hyperbolic Riemann surface admits such a representation. The concept is named after Lazarus Fuchs.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Fuchsian_model"}
