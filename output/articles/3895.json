{"title":"Degree-constrained spanning tree","summary":"In graph theory, a degree-constrained spanning tree is a spanning tree where the maximum vertex degree is limited to a certain constant k. The degree-constrained spanning tree problem is to determine whether a particular graph has such a spanning tree for a particular k.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Degree-constrained_spanning_tree"}
