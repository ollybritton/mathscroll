{"title":"Elastic pendulum","summary":"In physics and mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, an elastic pendulum[1][2] (also called spring pendulum[3][4] or swinging spring) is a physical system where a piece of mass is connected to a spring so that the resulting motion contains  elements of both a simple pendulum and a one-dimensional spring-mass system.[2] The system exhibits chaotic behaviour and is sensitive to initial conditions.[2] The motion of an elastic pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations.","image":"2D_spring_Pendulum.gif","url":"Elastic_pendulum"}
