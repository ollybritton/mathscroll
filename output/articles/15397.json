{"title":"Symplectic basis","summary":"In linear algebra, a standard symplectic basis is a basis e i , f i {\\displaystyle {\\mathbf {e} }_{i},{\\mathbf {f} }_{i}} of a symplectic vector space, which is a vector space with a nondegenerate alternating bilinear form ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } , such that ω ( e i , e j ) = 0 = ω ( f i , f j ) , ω ( e i , f j ) = δ i j {\\displaystyle \\omega ({\\mathbf {e} }_{i},{\\mathbf {e} }_{j})=0=\\omega ({\\mathbf {f} }_{i},{\\mathbf {f} }_{j}),\\omega ({\\mathbf {e} }_{i},{\\mathbf {f} }_{j})=\\delta _{ij}} . A symplectic basis of a symplectic vector space always exists; it can be constructed by a procedure similar to the Gram–Schmidt process.[1] The existence of the basis implies in particular that the dimension of a symplectic vector space is even if it is finite.","image":"dd8b9b81bfb5e34e63854dc67b027bcfa96f5c48.svg","url":"Symplectic_basis"}
