{"title":"Four exponentials conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, specifically the field of transcendental number theory, the four exponentials conjecture is a conjecture which, given the right conditions on the exponents, would guarantee the transcendence of at least one of four exponentials.  The conjecture, along with two related, stronger conjectures, is at the top of a hierarchy of conjectures and theorems concerning the arithmetic nature of a certain number of values of the exponential function.","image":"b3e5c96e1faf9156564ec8cf8f9360cb632e72a6.svg","url":"Four_exponentials_conjecture"}
