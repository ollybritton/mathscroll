{"title":"Quantum graph","summary":"In mathematics and  physics, a quantum graph is a linear, network-shaped structure  of vertices connected on edges (i.e., a graph) in which each edge is given a length and where a differential (or pseudo-differential) equation is posed on each edge. An example would be a power network consisting of power lines (edges) connected at transformer stations (vertices); the differential equations would then describe the voltage along each of the lines, with boundary conditions for each edge provided at the adjacent vertices ensuring that the current added over all edges adds to zero at each vertex.","image":"Quantumgraph.png.webp","url":"Quantum_graph"}
