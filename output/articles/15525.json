{"title":"Tate module","summary":"In mathematics, a Tate module of an abelian group, named for John Tate, is a module constructed from an abelian group A. Often, this construction is made in the following situation: G is a commutative group scheme over a field K, Ks is the separable closure of K, and A = G(Ks) (the Ks-valued points of G). In this case, the Tate module of A is equipped with an action of the absolute Galois group of K, and it is referred to as the Tate module of G.","image":"93d6c952b12da4c24d2065cf48b3bdbefcaa2bde.svg","url":"Tate_module"}
