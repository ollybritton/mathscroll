{"title":"Distance-regular graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a distance-regular graph is a regular graph such that for any two vertices v and w, the number of vertices at distance j from v and at distance k from w depends only upon j, k, and the distance between v and w.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Distance-regular_graph"}
