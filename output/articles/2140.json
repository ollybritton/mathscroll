{"title":"Calculus of moving surfaces","summary":"The calculus of moving surfaces (CMS) [1] is an extension of the classical tensor calculus to deforming manifolds. Central to the CMS is the Tensorial Time Derivative ∇ ˙ {\\displaystyle {\\dot {\\nabla }}} whose original definition [2] was put forth by Jacques Hadamard. It plays the role analogous to that of the covariant derivative ∇ α {\\displaystyle \\nabla _{\\alpha }} on differential manifolds in that it produces a tensor when applied to a tensor.","image":"01f568b3ba344fbca9675bbce79b40463ceb329c.svg","url":"Calculus_of_moving_surfaces"}
