{"title":"Retraction (topology)","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, a retraction is a continuous mapping from a topological space into a subspace that preserves the position of all points in that subspace.[1] The subspace is then called a retract of the original space. A deformation retraction is a mapping that captures the idea of continuously shrinking a space into a subspace.","image":"124ce76cfdeb9cbc4cfe3b978751697b595ada1f.svg","url":"Retraction_(topology)"}
