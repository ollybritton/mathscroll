{"title":"Direct comparison test","summary":"In mathematics, the comparison test, sometimes called the direct comparison test to distinguish it from similar related tests (especially the limit comparison test), provides a way of deducing the convergence or divergence of an infinite series or an improper integral. In both cases, the test works by comparing the given series or integral to one whose convergence properties are known.","image":"9a8f2f11d689b4df30d2131ecb758ca4b83ce900.svg","url":"Direct_comparison_test"}
