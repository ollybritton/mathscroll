{"title":"Homotopy","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, two continuous functions from one topological space to another are called homotopic (from Ancient Greek: ὁμός homós \"same, similar\" and τόπος tópos \"place\") if one can be \"continuously deformed\" into the other, such a deformation being called a homotopy (/həˈmɒtəpiː/,[1] hə-MO-tə-pee; /ˈhoʊmoʊˌtoʊpiː/,[2] HOH-moh-toh-pee) between the two functions. A notable use of homotopy is the definition of homotopy groups and cohomotopy groups, important invariants in algebraic topology.[3]","image":"HomotopySmall.gif","url":"Homotopy"}
