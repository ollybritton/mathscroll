{"title":"Levi-Civita connection","summary":"In Riemannian or pseudo Riemannian geometry (in particular the Lorentzian geometry of general relativity), the Levi-Civita connection is the unique affine connection on the tangent bundle of a manifold (i.e. affine connection) that preserves the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric and is torsion-free.","image":"170ea057f2d37e0bc75d8d0d55599225e9c7e655.svg","url":"Levi-Civita_connection"}
