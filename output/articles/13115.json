{"title":"Rank 3 permutation group","summary":"In mathematical finite group theory, a rank 3 permutation group acts transitively on a set such that the stabilizer of a point has 3 orbits. The study of these groups was started by HigmanÂ (1964, 1971). Several of the sporadic simple groups were discovered as rank 3 permutation groups.","image":"b06ba2ce33f6279376765fc62f25cd9a5de8ee4c.svg","url":"Rank_3_permutation_group"}
