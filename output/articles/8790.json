{"title":"Kolmogorov's zero–one law","summary":"In probability theory, Kolmogorov's zero–one law, named in honor of Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, specifies that a certain type of event, namely a tail event of independent σ-algebras, will either almost surely happen or almost surely not happen; that is, the probability of such an event occurring is zero or one.","image":"33c25229c6989c235f9cbb7908331f6d01d0abfe.svg","url":"Kolmogorov's_zero–one_law"}
