{"title":"Descendant tree (group theory)","summary":"In mathematics, specifically group theory, a descendant tree is a hierarchical structure that visualizes parent-descendant relations between isomorphism classes of finite groups of prime power order p n {\\displaystyle p^{n}} , for a fixed prime number p {\\displaystyle p} and varying integer exponents n â‰¥ 0 {\\displaystyle n\\geq 0} . Such groups are briefly called finite p-groups. The vertices of a descendant tree are isomorphism classes of finite p-groups.","image":"c6a7a7e74ae90ab94f01e1629177758fb68b423b.svg","url":"Descendant_tree_(group_theory)"}
