{"title":"Translation (geometry)","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, a translation is a geometric transformation that moves every point of a figure, shape or space by the same distance in a given direction. A translation can also be interpreted as the addition of a constant vector to every point, or as shifting the origin of the coordinate system. In a Euclidean space, any translation is an isometry.","image":"Traslazione_OK.svg.png.webp","url":"Translation_(geometry)"}
