{"title":"Nevanlinna's criterion","summary":"In mathematics, Nevanlinna's criterion in complex analysis, proved in 1920 by the Finnish mathematician Rolf Nevanlinna, characterizes holomorphic univalent functions on the unit disk which are starlike. Nevanlinna used this criterion to prove the Bieberbach conjecture for starlike univalent functions.","image":"849c9a72d554d0e3ebc7f9c62813e8f457dbdba8.svg","url":"Nevanlinna's_criterion"}
