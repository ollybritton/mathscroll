{"title":"Iverson bracket","summary":"In mathematics, the Iverson bracket, named after Kenneth E. Iverson, is a notation that generalises the Kronecker delta, which is the Iverson bracket of the statement x = y. It maps any statement to a function of the free variables in that statement.

It is generally denoted by putting the statement inside square brackets:","image":"ead533e8bdd9bcb51828f0d580bdc2d70a799da6.svg","url":"Iverson_bracket"}
