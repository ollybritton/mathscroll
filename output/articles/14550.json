{"title":"Small hexacronic icositetrahedron","summary":"In geometry, the small hexacronic icositetrahedron is the dual of the small cubicuboctahedron. It is visually identical to the small rhombihexacron. A part of each dart lies inside the solid, hence is invisible in solid models.","image":"DU13_small_hexacronic_icositetrahedron.png.webp","url":"Small_hexacronic_icositetrahedron"}
