{"title":"Fiber-homotopy equivalence","summary":"In algebraic topology, a fiber-homotopy equivalence is a map over a space B that has homotopy inverse over B (that is we require a homotopy be a map over B for each time t.) It is a relative analog of a homotopy equivalence between spaces.","image":"dd62d957c832a8423443a6bf216ebba7981cfade.svg","url":"Fiber-homotopy_equivalence"}
