{"title":"Fully polynomial-time approximation scheme","summary":"A fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) is an algorithm for finding approximate solutions to function problems, especially optimization problems.  An FPTAS takes as input an instance of the problem and a parameter ε > 0. It returns as output a value is at least 1 − ϵ {\\displaystyle 1-\\epsilon } times the correct value, and at most 1 + ϵ {\\displaystyle 1+\\epsilon } times the correct value.","image":"57f9b07affe80ff61cdc4f2e47977c8421a59c73.svg","url":"Fully_polynomial-time_approximation_scheme"}
