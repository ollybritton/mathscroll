{"title":"Kramers–Kronig relations","summary":"The Kramers–Kronig relations are bidirectional mathematical relations, connecting the real and imaginary parts of any complex function that is analytic in the upper half-plane. The relations are often used to compute the real part from the imaginary part (or vice versa) of response functions in physical systems, because for stable systems, causality implies the condition of analyticity, and conversely, analyticity implies causality of the corresponding stable physical system.[1]  The relation is named in honor of Ralph Kronig and Hans Kramers.[2][3] In mathematics, these relations are known by the names Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem and Hilbert transform.","image":"Kramersgifwiki.gif","url":"Kramers–Kronig_relations"}
