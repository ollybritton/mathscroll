{"title":"Pentagrammic cuploid","summary":"In geometry, the pentagrammic cuploid or pentagrammmic semicupola is the simplest of the infinite family of cuploids. It can be obtained as a slice of the small complex rhombicosidodecahedron. As in all cupolae, the base polygon has twice as many edges and vertices as the top; but in this case the base polygon is a degenerate {10/2} decagram, as the top is a {5/2} pentagram. Hence, the degenerate base is withdrawn and the triangles are connected to the squares instead.","image":"Pentagrammic_cuploid.png.webp","url":"Pentagrammic_cuploid"}
