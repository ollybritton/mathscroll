{"title":"Linear system of conics","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the conic sections in the projective plane form a linear system of dimension five, as one sees by counting the constants in the degree two equations. The condition to pass through a given point P imposes a single linear condition, so that conics C through P form a linear system of dimension 4. Other types of condition that are of interest include tangency to a given lineÂ L.","image":"544cd531a296e2923a49d912eb9ff25d736911fc.svg","url":"Linear_system_of_conics"}
