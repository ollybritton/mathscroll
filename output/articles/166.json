{"title":"James Clerk Maxwell","summary":"James Clerk Maxwell FRSE FRS (13 June 1831 – 5 November 1879) was a Scottish mathematician[1][2] and scientist responsible for the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, which was the first theory to describe electricity, magnetism and light as different manifestations of the same phenomenon. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the \"second great unification in physics\"[3] where the first one had been realised by Isaac Newton.","image":"James-Clerk-Maxwell-1831-1879.jpg.webp","url":"A%2fJames_Clerk_Maxwell"}
