{"title":"Viterbi algorithm","summary":"The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for obtaining the maximum a posteriori probability estimate of the most likely sequence of hidden states—called the Viterbi path—that results in a sequence of observed events, especially in the context of Markov information sources and hidden Markov models (HMM).","image":"7b4a7988eca050457fffb7fb10ce63c1c8de3179.svg","url":"Viterbi_algorithm"}
