{"title":"Complete coloring","summary":"In graph theory, a complete coloring is a vertex coloring in which every pair of colors appears on at least one pair of adjacent vertices. Equivalently, a complete coloring is minimal in the sense that it cannot be transformed into a proper coloring with fewer colors by merging pairs of color classes. The achromatic number Ïˆ(G) of a graph G is the maximum number of colors possible in any complete coloring of G.","image":"Complete_coloring_clebsch_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Complete_coloring"}
