{"title":"Grushko theorem","summary":"In the mathematical subject of group theory, the Grushko theorem or the Grushkoâ€“Neumann theorem is a theorem stating that the rank (that is, the smallest cardinality of a generating set) of a free product of two groups is equal to the sum of the ranks of the two free factors. The theorem was first obtained in a 1940 article of Grushko[1] and then, independently, in a 1943 article of Neumann.[2]","image":"b6e0260bd40f26045ba659bf08278da0b9d433ed.svg","url":"Grushko_theorem"}
