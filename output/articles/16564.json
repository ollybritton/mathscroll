{"title":"Verhoeff algorithm","summary":"The Verhoeff algorithm[1] is a checksum for error detection first published by Dutch mathematician Jacobus Verhoeff in 1969.[2][3]  It was the first decimal check digit algorithm which detects all single-digit errors, and all transposition errors involving two adjacent digits,[4] which was at the time thought impossible with such a code.","image":"0aae0fc530390b62f9fa9e136ba62961d06f99f4.svg","url":"Verhoeff_algorithm"}
