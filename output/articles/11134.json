{"title":"Noetherian scheme","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a noetherian scheme is a scheme that admits a finite covering by open affine subsets Spec ‚Å° A i {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Spec} A_{i}} , A i {\\displaystyle A_{i}} noetherian rings. More generally, a scheme is locally noetherian if it is covered by spectra of noetherian rings. Thus, a scheme is noetherian if and only if it is locally noetherian and quasi-compact.  As with noetherian rings, the concept is named after Emmy Noether.","image":"6832f88d69182f9aa690c45bcb731ecd9c3a3664.svg","url":"Noetherian_scheme"}
