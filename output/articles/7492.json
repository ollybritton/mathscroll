{"title":"Hyperbolic orthogonality","summary":"In geometry, the relation of hyperbolic orthogonality between two lines separated by the asymptotes of a hyperbola is a concept used in special relativity to define simultaneous events. Two events will be simultaneous when they are on a line hyperbolically orthogonal to a particular time line. This dependence on a certain time line is determined by velocity, and is the basis for the relativity of simultaneity.","image":"Orthogonality_and_rotation.svg.png.webp","url":"Hyperbolic_orthogonality"}
