{"title":"Hyperkähler manifold","summary":"In differential geometry, a hyperkähler manifold is a Riemannian manifold ( M , g ) {\\displaystyle (M,g)} endowed with three integrable almost complex structures I , J , K {\\displaystyle I,J,K} that are Kähler with respect to the Riemannian metric g {\\displaystyle g} and satisfy the quaternionic relations I 2 = J 2 = K 2 = I J K = − 1 {\\displaystyle I^{2}=J^{2}=K^{2}=IJK=-1} . In particular, it is a hypercomplex manifold. All hyperkähler manifolds are Ricci-flat and are thus Calabi–Yau manifolds.[lower-alpha 1]","image":"68e27d2e539fd0c3a9a7efab6257abd17de7fc57.svg","url":"Hyperkähler_manifold"}
