{"title":"Factorial number system","summary":"In combinatorics, the factorial number system, also called factoradic, is a mixed radix numeral system adapted to numbering permutations.  It is also called factorial base, although factorials do not function as base, but as place value of digits. By converting a number less than n! to factorial representation, one obtains a sequence of n digits that can be converted to a permutation of n elements in a straightforward way, either using them as Lehmer code or as inversion table[1] representation; in the former case the resulting map from integers to permutations of n elements lists them in lexicographical order. General mixed radix systems were studied by Georg Cantor.[2] The term \"factorial number system\" is used by Knuth,[3] while the French equivalent \"num√©ration factorielle\" was first used in 1888.[4] The term \"factoradic\", which is a portmanteau of factorial and mixed radix, appears to be of more recent date.[5]","image":"829091f745070b9eb97a80244129025440a1cfac.svg","url":"Factorial_number_system"}
