{"title":"Zariski's lemma","summary":"In algebra, Zariski's lemma, proved by Oscar ZariskiÂ (1947), states that, if a field K is finitely generated as an associative algebra over another field k, then K is a finite field extension of k (that is, it is also finitely generated as a vector space).","image":"86579daf6d3e3655af2326a44dcfe4981eb7b2e4.svg","url":"Zariski's_lemma"}
