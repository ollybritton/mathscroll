{"title":"Dense graph","summary":"In mathematics, a dense graph is a graph in which the number of edges is close to the maximal number of edges (where every pair of vertices is connected by one edge). The opposite, a graph with only a few edges, is a sparse graph. The distinction of what constitutes a dense or sparse graph is ill-defined, and depends on context.","image":"4d215e86a0937b27bc8c9f609cfb4efe46726de3.svg","url":"Dense_graph"}
