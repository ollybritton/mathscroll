{"title":"Spherical trigonometry","summary":"Spherical trigonometry is the branch of spherical geometry that deals with the metrical relationships between the sides and angles of spherical triangles, traditionally expressed using trigonometric functions. On the sphere, geodesics are great circles. Spherical trigonometry is of great importance for calculations in astronomy, geodesy, and navigation.","image":"Triangle_trirectangle.png.webp","url":"Spherical_trigonometry"}
