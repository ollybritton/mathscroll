{"title":"Conditional event algebra","summary":"A standard, Boolean algebra of events is a set of events related to one another by the familiar operations and, or, and not. A conditional event algebra (CEA) contains not just ordinary events but also conditional events, which have the form \"if A, then B\". The usual purpose of a CEA is to enable the defining of a probability function, P, that satisfies the equation P(if A then B) = P(A and B) / P(A).","image":"8b16e2bdaefee9eed86d866e6eba3ac47c710f60.svg","url":"Conditional_event_algebra"}
