{"title":"Babylonian mathematics","summary":"Babylonian mathematics (also known as Assyro-Babylonian mathematics[1][2][3][4]) are the mathematics developed or practiced by the people of Mesopotamia, from the days of the early Sumerians to the centuries following the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. Babylonian mathematical texts are plentiful and well edited.[5] With respect to time they fall in two distinct groups: one from the Old Babylonian period (1830â€“1531 BC), the other mainly Seleucid from the last three or four centuries BC. With respect to content, there is scarcely any difference between the two groups of texts. Babylonian mathematics remained constant, in character and content, for nearly two millennia.[5]","image":"YBC-7289-OBV-labeled.jpg.webp","url":"Babylonian_mathematics"}
