{"title":"Peeling theorem","summary":"In general relativity, the peeling theorem describes the asymptotic behavior of the Weyl tensor as one goes to null infinity. Let γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } be a null geodesic in a spacetime ( M , g a b ) {\\displaystyle (M,g_{ab})} from a point p to null infinity, with affine parameter λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } . Then the theorem states that, as λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } tends to infinity:","image":"a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a.svg","url":"Peeling_theorem"}
