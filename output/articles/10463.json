{"title":"Milman's reverse Brunn–Minkowski inequality","summary":"In mathematics, particularly, in asymptotic convex geometry, Milman's reverse Brunn–Minkowski inequality is a result due to Vitali Milman[1] that provides a reverse inequality to the famous Brunn–Minkowski inequality for convex bodies in n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn. Namely, it bounds the volume of the Minkowski sum of two bodies from above in terms of the volumes of the bodies.","image":"a38ef019e403c6fbc714b05e71bd93c4b19f712c.svg","url":"Milman's_reverse_Brunn–Minkowski_inequality"}
