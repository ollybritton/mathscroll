{"title":"Automorphic form","summary":"In harmonic analysis and number theory, an automorphic form is a well-behaved function from a topological group G to the complex numbers (or complex vector space) which is invariant under the action of a discrete subgroup Γ ⊂ G {\\displaystyle \\Gamma \\subset G} of the topological group. Automorphic forms are a generalization of the idea of periodic functions in Euclidean space to general topological groups.","image":"7cddbe5da57bcbe9d0008845192a80105f34b9bf.svg","url":"Automorphic_form"}
