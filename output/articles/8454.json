{"title":"Jouanolou's trick","summary":"In algebraic geometry, Jouanolou's trick is a theorem that asserts, for an algebraic variety X, the existence of a surjection with affine fibers from an affine variety W to X.  The variety W is therefore homotopy-equivalent to X, but it has the technically advantageous property of being affine.  Jouanolou's original statement of the theorem required that X be quasi-projective over an affine scheme, but this has since been considerably weakened.","image":"120f679323beadc1efc79d87af4ed98982cc881a.svg","url":"Jouanolou's_trick"}
