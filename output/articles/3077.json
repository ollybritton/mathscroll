{"title":"Compound of ten octahedra","summary":"The compounds of ten octahedra UC15 and UC16 are two uniform polyhedron compounds. They are composed of a symmetric arrangement of 10 octahedra, considered as triangular antiprisms, aligned with the axes of three-fold rotational symmetry of an icosahedron. The two compounds differ in the orientation of their octahedra: each compound may be transformed into the other by rotating each octahedron by 60 degrees.","image":"UC15-10_octahedra.png.webp","url":"Compound_of_ten_octahedra"}
