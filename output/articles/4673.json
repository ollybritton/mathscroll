{"title":"Eigenvalues and eigenvectors","summary":"In linear algebra, an eigenvector (/ˈaɪɡənˌvɛktər/) or characteristic vector of a linear transformation is a nonzero vector that changes at most by a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. The corresponding eigenvalue, often denoted by λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } , is the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled.","image":"b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a.svg","url":"Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors"}
