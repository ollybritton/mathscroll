{"title":"Star unfolding","summary":"In computational geometry, the star unfolding of a convex polyhedron is a net obtained by cutting the polyhedron along geodesics (shortest paths) through its faces. It has also been called the inward layout of the polyhedron, or the Alexandrov unfolding after Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov, who first considered it.[1]","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Star_unfolding"}
