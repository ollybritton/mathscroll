{"title":"Bracket (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, brackets of various typographical forms, such as parentheses ( ), square brackets [ ], braces { } and angle brackets ⟨ ⟩, are frequently used in mathematical notation. Generally, such bracketing denotes some form of grouping: in evaluating an expression containing a bracketed sub-expression, the operators in the sub-expression take precedence over those surrounding it. Sometimes, for the clarity of reading, different kinds of brackets are used to express the same meaning of precedence in a single expression with deep nesting of sub-expressions.[1]","image":"0d179cd06bb15e5f45d9ae598c8daa7d2bfbbafd.svg","url":"Bracket_(mathematics)"}
