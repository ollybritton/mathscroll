{"title":"Weierstrass factorization theorem","summary":"In mathematics, and particularly in the field of complex analysis, the Weierstrass factorization theorem asserts that every entire function can be represented as a (possibly infinite) product involving its zeroes.  The theorem may be viewed as an extension of the fundamental theorem of algebra, which asserts that every polynomial may be factored into linear factors, one for each root.","image":"1f9c45c223cda6dec957694647de611e40c27ece.svg","url":"Weierstrass_factorization_theorem"}
