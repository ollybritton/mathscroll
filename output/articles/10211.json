{"title":"Maximal surface","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a maximal surface is a certain kind of submanifold of a Lorentzian manifold. Precisely, given a Lorentzian manifold (M, g), a maximal surface is a spacelike submanifold of M whose mean curvature is zero.[1] As such, maximal surfaces in Lorentzian geometry are directly analogous to minimal surfaces in Riemannian geometry. The difference in terminology between the two settings has to do with the fact that small regions in maximal surfaces are local maximizers of the area functional, while small regions in minimal surfaces are local minimizers of the area functional.[2]","image":"Closed_Access_logo_transparent.svg.png.webp","url":"Maximal_surface"}
