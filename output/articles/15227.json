{"title":"Sufficient statistic","summary":"In statistics, a statistic is sufficient with respect to a statistical model and its associated unknown parameter if \"no other statistic that can be calculated from the same sample provides any additional information as to the value of the parameter\".[1] In particular, a statistic is sufficient for a family of probability distributions if the sample from which it is calculated gives no additional information than the statistic, as to which of those probability distributions is the sampling distribution.","image":"9f75966a2f9d5672136fa9401ee1e75008f95ffd.svg","url":"Sufficient_statistic"}
