{"title":"Feynman parametrization","summary":"Feynman parametrization is a technique for evaluating loop integrals which arise from Feynman diagrams with one or more loops. However, it is sometimes useful in integration in areas of pure mathematics as well.","image":"ba6124fb1e6f1989accc58fa8f8fdefeb8f767bf.svg","url":"Feynman_parametrization"}
