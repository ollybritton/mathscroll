{"title":"Absolute convergence","summary":"In mathematics, an infinite series of numbers is said to converge absolutely (or to be absolutely convergent) if the sum of the absolute values of the summands is finite.  More precisely, a real or complex series ∑ n = 0 ∞ a n {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\sum _{n=0}^{\\infty }a_{n}} is said to converge absolutely if ∑ n = 0 ∞ | a n | = L {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\sum _{n=0}^{\\infty }\\left|a_{n}\\right|=L} for some real number L . {\\displaystyle \\textstyle L.} Similarly, an improper integral of a function, ∫ 0 ∞ f ( x ) d x , {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\int _{0}^{\\infty }f(x)\\,dx,} is said to converge absolutely if the integral of the absolute value of the integrand is finite—that is, if ∫ 0 ∞ | f ( x ) | d x = L . {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\int _{0}^{\\infty }|f(x)|dx=L.}","image":"e82e9cba73339069c69edf3d9e3553754ea73080.svg","url":"Absolute_convergence"}
