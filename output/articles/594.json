{"title":"Algebraic function field","summary":"In mathematics, an algebraic function field (often abbreviated as function field) of n variables over a field k is a finitely generated field extension K/k which has transcendence degree n over k.[1] Equivalently, an algebraic function field of n variables over k may be defined as a finite field extension of the field K = k(x1,...,xn) of rational functions in n variables over k.","image":"1ba5510b413762efd5d8b7f3e00ef1648f9aa698.svg","url":"Algebraic_function_field"}
