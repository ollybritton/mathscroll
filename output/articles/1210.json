{"title":"Axiomatic quantum field theory","summary":"Axiomatic quantum field theory is a mathematical discipline which aims to describe quantum field theory in terms of rigorous axioms.  It is strongly associated with functional analysis and operator algebras, but has also been studied in recent years from a more geometric and functorial perspective.","image":"051e581f7118661a6713004db4933daeb78e8338.svg","url":"Axiomatic_quantum_field_theory"}
