{"title":"Displacement (geometry)","summary":"In geometry and mechanics, a displacement is a vector whose length is the shortest distance from the initial to the final position of a point P undergoing motion.[1] It quantifies both the distance and direction of the net or total motion along a straight line from the initial position to the final position of the point trajectory. A displacement may be identified with the translation that maps the initial position to the final position.","image":"Distancedisplacement.svg.png.webp","url":"Displacement_(geometry)"}
