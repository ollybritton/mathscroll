{"title":"Jet (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, the jet is an operation that takes a differentiable function f and produces a polynomial, the truncated Taylor polynomial of f, at each point of its domain. Although this is the definition of a jet, the theory of jets regards these polynomials as being abstract polynomials rather than polynomial functions.","image":"556cd9fc4e4c1d8d7c83e5534a8b38e9c5b6ba07.svg","url":"Jet_(mathematics)"}
