{"title":"Scalar multiplication","summary":"In mathematics, scalar multiplication is one of the basic operations defining a vector space in linear algebra[1][2][3] (or more generally, a module in abstract algebra[4][5]). In common geometrical contexts, scalar multiplication of a real Euclidean vector by a positive real number multiplies the magnitude of the vectorâ€”without changing its direction. The term \"scalar\" itself derives from this usage: a scalar is that which scales vectors. Scalar multiplication is the multiplication of a vector by a scalar (where the product is a vector), and is to be distinguished from inner product of two vectors (where the product is a scalar).","image":"Scalar_multiplication_by_r%3D3.svg.png.webp","url":"Scalar_multiplication"}
