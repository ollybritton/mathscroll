{"title":"Unscented optimal control","summary":"In mathematics, unscented optimal control combines the notion of the unscented transform with deterministic optimal control to address a class of uncertain optimal control problems.[1][2][3] It is a specific application of Riemmann-Stieltjes optimal control theory,[4][5] a concept introduced by Ross and his coworkers.","image":"1871ffeb57c11624b375dbb7157d5887c706eb87.svg","url":"Unscented_optimal_control"}
