{"title":"Well-pointed category","summary":"In category theory, a category with a terminal object 1 {\\displaystyle 1} is well-pointed if for every pair of arrows f , g : A → B {\\displaystyle f,g:A\\to B} such that f ≠ g {\\displaystyle f\\neq g} , there is an arrow p : 1 → A {\\displaystyle p:1\\to A} such that f ∘ p ≠ g ∘ p {\\displaystyle f\\circ p\\neq g\\circ p} . (The arrows p {\\displaystyle p} are called the global elements or points of the category; a well-pointed category is thus one that has \"enough points\" to distinguish non-equal arrows.)","image":"92d98b82a3778f043108d4e20960a9193df57cbf.svg","url":"Well-pointed_category"}
