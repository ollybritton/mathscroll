{"title":"Wiener sausage","summary":"In the mathematical field of probability, the Wiener sausage is a neighborhood of the trace of a Brownian motion up to a time t, given by taking all points within a fixed distance of  Brownian motion. It can be visualized as a sausage of fixed radius whose centerline is Brownian motion. The Wiener sausage was named after Norbert Wiener  by M. D. Donsker and S. R. Srinivasa VaradhanÂ (1975) because of its relation to the Wiener process; the name is also a pun on Vienna sausage, as \"Wiener\" is German for \"Viennese\".","image":"Wiener_process_3d.png.webp","url":"Wiener_sausage"}
