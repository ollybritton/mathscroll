{"title":"Saturated model","summary":"In mathematical logic, and particularly in its subfield model theory, a saturated model M is one that realizes as many complete types as may be \"reasonably expected\" given its size.  For example, an ultrapower model of the hyperreals is â„µ 1 {\\displaystyle \\aleph _{1}} -saturated, meaning that every descending nested sequence of internal sets has a nonempty intersection.[1]","image":"78c211ce8badf4ffbf9417ecceb0ef7ab0a8caed.svg","url":"Saturated_model"}
