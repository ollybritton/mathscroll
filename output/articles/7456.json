{"title":"Huntington–Hill method","summary":"The Huntington–Hill method is a method for proportional allocation of the seats in a representative assembly by minimizing the percentage differences in the number of constituents represented by each seat. Edward Huntington formulated this approach, building on the earlier work of Joseph Adna Hill, and called it the method of equal proportions.[1] Since 1941, this method has been used to apportion the 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives following the completion of each decennial census.[2][3]","image":"A_coloured_voting_box_(no_bg).svg.png.webp","url":"Huntington–Hill_method"}
