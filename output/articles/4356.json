{"title":"Dixon's identity","summary":"In mathematics, Dixon's identity (or Dixon's theorem or Dixon's formula) is any of several different but closely related identities proved by A. C. Dixon, some involving finite sums of products of three binomial coefficients, and some evaluating a hypergeometric sum.  These identities famously follow from the MacMahon Master theorem, and can now be routinely proved by computer algorithms (Ekhad 1990).","image":"dccd096ec104c2627f808d27ea36cfb17fef9544.svg","url":"Dixon's_identity"}
