{"title":"Uniform boundedness conjecture for rational points","summary":"In arithmetic geometry, the uniform boundedness conjecture for rational points asserts that for a given number field K {\\displaystyle K} and a positive integer g â‰¥ 2 {\\displaystyle g\\geq 2} that there exists a number N ( K , g ) {\\displaystyle N(K,g)} depending only on K {\\displaystyle K} and g {\\displaystyle g} such that for any algebraic curve C {\\displaystyle C} defined over K {\\displaystyle K} having genus equal to g {\\displaystyle g} has at most N ( K , g ) {\\displaystyle N(K,g)} K {\\displaystyle K} -rational points. This is a refinement of Faltings's theorem, which asserts that the set of K {\\displaystyle K} -rational points C ( K ) {\\displaystyle C(K)} is necessarily finite.","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Uniform_boundedness_conjecture_for_rational_points"}
