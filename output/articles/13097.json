{"title":"Random search","summary":"Random search (RS) is a family of numerical optimization methods that do not require the gradient of the problem to be optimized, and RS can hence be used on functions that are not continuous or differentiable. Such optimization methods are also known as direct-search, derivative-free, or black-box methods.","image":"10d6130ba40831b325bfe0b136e160f1d39b6b0d.svg","url":"Random_search"}
