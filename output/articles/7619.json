{"title":"Ideal theory","summary":"In mathematics, ideal theory is the theory of ideals in commutative rings. While the notion of an ideal exists also for non-commutative rings, a much more substantial theory exists only for commutative rings (and this article therefore only considers ideals in commutative rings.)","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Ideal_theory"}
