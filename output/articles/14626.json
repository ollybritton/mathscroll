{"title":"Snub trihexagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the snub hexagonal tiling (or snub trihexagonal tiling) is a semiregular tiling of the Euclidean plane. There are four triangles and one hexagon on each vertex. It has Schläfli symbol sr{3,6}. The snub tetrahexagonal tiling is a related hyperbolic tiling with Schläfli symbol sr{4,6}.","image":"Tiling_snub_3-6_left_simple.svg.png.webp","url":"Snub_trihexagonal_tiling"}
