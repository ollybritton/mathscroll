{"title":"Mean transverse energy","summary":"In accelerator physics, the mean transverse energy (MTE) is a quantity that describes the variance of the transverse momentum of a beam. While the quantity has a defined value for any particle beam, it is generally used in the context of photoinjectors for electron beams.[1]","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Mean_transverse_energy"}
