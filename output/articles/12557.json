{"title":"Probability mass function","summary":"In probability and statistics, a probability mass function is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.[1]  Sometimes it is also known as the discrete density function. The probability mass function is often the primary means of defining a discrete probability distribution, and such functions exist for either scalar or multivariate random variables whose domain is discrete.","image":"Discrete_probability_distrib.svg.png.webp","url":"Probability_mass_function"}
