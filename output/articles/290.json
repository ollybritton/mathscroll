{"title":"Abstract Wiener space","summary":"The concept of an abstract Wiener space is a mathematical construction developed by Leonard Gross to understand the structure of Gaussian measures on infinite-dimensional spaces. The construction emphasizes the fundamental role played by the Cameronâ€“Martin space. The classical Wiener space is the prototypical example.","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Abstract_Wiener_space"}
