{"title":"Inverse mean curvature flow","summary":"In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and geometric analysis, inverse mean curvature flow (IMCF) is a geometric flow of submanifolds of a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold. It has been used to prove a certain case of the Riemannian Penrose inequality, which is of interest in general relativity.","image":"dcb753dd03ee8afbf459c59a26929a2f90d02f19.svg","url":"Inverse_mean_curvature_flow"}
