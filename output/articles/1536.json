{"title":"Beta prime distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the beta prime distribution (also known as inverted beta distribution or beta distribution of the second kind[1]) is an absolutely continuous probability distribution. If p ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] {\\displaystyle p\\in [0,1]} has a beta distribution, then the odds p 1 − p {\\displaystyle {\\frac {p}{1-p}}} has a beta prime distribution.","image":"33c3a52aa7b2d00227e85c641cca67e85583c43c.svg","url":"Beta_prime_distribution"}
