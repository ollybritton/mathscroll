{"title":"List of forcing notions","summary":"In mathematics, forcing is a method of constructing new models M[G] of set theory by adding a generic subset G of a poset P to a model M. The poset P used will determine what statements hold in the new universe (the 'extension'); to force a statement of interest thus requires construction of a suitable P. This article lists some of the posets P that have been used in this construction.","image":"b0b3c0e79d8a5db977a9838be477eb3e30348937.svg","url":"List_of_forcing_notions"}
