{"title":"Adams operation","summary":"In mathematics, an Adams operation, denoted Ïˆk for natural numbers k,  is a cohomology operation in topological K-theory, or any allied operation in algebraic K-theory or other types of algebraic construction, defined on a pattern introduced by Frank Adams. The basic idea is to implement some fundamental identities in symmetric function theory, at the level of vector bundles or other representing object in more abstract theories.","image":"9eea729d3e803e271649a7ddf4d94d9280484773.svg","url":"Adams_operation"}
