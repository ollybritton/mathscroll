{"title":"Sum of four cubes problem","summary":"The sum of four cubes problem[1] asks whether every integer is the sum of four cubes of integers.  It is conjectured the answer is affirmative, but this conjecture has been neither proved nor disproved.[2] Some of the cubes may be negative numbers, in contrast to Waring's problem on sums of cubes, where they are required to be positive.","image":"e9e080cc2eafee922b37e5d1f40ea9c4555f963e.svg","url":"Sum_of_four_cubes_problem"}
