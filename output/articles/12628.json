{"title":"Projectively extended real line","summary":"In real analysis, the projectively extended real line (also called the one-point compactification of the real line), is the extension of the set of the real numbers, R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } , by a point denoted ∞.[1] It is thus the set R ∪ { ∞ } {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} \\cup \\{\\infty \\}} with the standard arithmetic operations extended where possible,[1] and is sometimes denoted by R ∗ {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{*}} [2] or R ^ . {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {\\mathbb {R} }}.} The added point is called the point at infinity, because it is considered as a neighbour of both ends of the real line. More precisely, the point at infinity is the limit of every sequence of real numbers whose absolute values are increasing and unbounded.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Projectively_extended_real_line"}
