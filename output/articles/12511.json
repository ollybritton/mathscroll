{"title":"Prince Rupert's cube","summary":"In geometry, Prince Rupert's cube is the largest cube that can pass through a hole cut through a unit cube without splitting it into two pieces. Its side length is approximately 1.06, 6% larger than the side length 1 of the unit cube through which it passes. The problem of finding the largest square that lies entirely within a unit cube is closely related, and has the same solution.","image":"Prince_Ruperts_cube.png.webp","url":"Prince_Rupert's_cube"}
