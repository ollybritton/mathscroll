{"title":"Inverse image functor","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry,  an inverse image functor is a contravariant construction of sheaves; here “contravariant” in the sense given a map f : X → Y {\\displaystyle f:X\\to Y} , the inverse image functor is a functor from the category of sheaves on Y to the category of sheaves on X. The direct image functor is the primary operation on sheaves, with the simplest definition. The inverse image exhibits some relatively subtle features.","image":"abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c.svg","url":"Inverse_image_functor"}
