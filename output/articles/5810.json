{"title":"Fully irreducible automorphism","summary":"In the mathematical subject geometric group theory, a fully irreducible automorphism of the free group Fn is an element of Out(Fn) which has no  periodic conjugacy classes of proper free factors in Fn (where n > 1). Fully irreducible automorphisms are also referred to as \"irreducible with irreducible powers\" or \"iwip\" automorphisms. The notion of being fully irreducible provides a key Out(Fn) counterpart of the notion of a pseudo-Anosov element of the mapping class group of a finite type surface. Fully irreducibles play an important role in the study of structural properties of individual elements  and of subgroups of Out(Fn).","image":"f136ee728b5a0e6f07164dd290413d0bb77bc778.svg","url":"Fully_irreducible_automorphism"}
