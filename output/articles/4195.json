{"title":"Direction cosine","summary":"In analytic geometry, the direction cosines (or directional cosines) of a vector are the cosines of the angles between the vector and the three positive coordinate axes. Equivalently, they are the contributions of each component of the basis to a unit vector in that direction.","image":"Direction_cosine_vector.svg.png.webp","url":"Direction_cosine"}
