{"title":"Small hexagonal hexecontahedron","summary":"In geometry, the small hexagonal hexecontahedron is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron. It is the dual of the uniform small snub icosicosidodecahedron. It is partially degenerate, having coincident vertices, as its dual has coplanar triangular faces.","image":"DU32_small_hexagonal_hexecontahedron.png.webp","url":"Small_hexagonal_hexecontahedron"}
