{"title":"Combinational logic","summary":"In automata theory, combinational logic (also referred to as time-independent logic [1] or combinatorial logic [2]) is a type of digital logic which is implemented by Boolean circuits, where the output is a pure function of the present input only. This is in contrast to sequential logic, in which the output depends not only on the present input but also on the history of the input. In other words, sequential logic has memory while combinational logic does not.","image":"Automata_theory.svg.png.webp","url":"Combinational_logic"}
