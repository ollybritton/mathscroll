{"title":"Measurement","summary":"Measurement is the quantification of attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events.[1][2] In other words, measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind.[3] The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. In natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the International vocabulary of metrology published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.[2] However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioural sciences, measurements can have multiple levels, which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales.[1][4]","image":"FourMetricInstruments.JPG.webp","url":"Measurement"}
