{"title":"Generic property","summary":"In mathematics, properties that hold for \"typical\" examples are called generic properties.  For instance, a generic property of a class of functions is one that is true of \"almost all\" of those functions, as in the statements, \"A generic polynomial does not have a root at zero,\" or \"A generic square matrix is invertible.\"  As another example, a generic property of a space is a property that holds at \"almost all\" points of the space, as in the statement, \"If f : M → N is a smooth function between smooth manifolds, then a generic point of N is not a critical value of f.\"  (This is by Sard's theorem.)","image":"3ffbb2059ab88e05c08bd94b77ffe93494454e87.svg","url":"Generic_property"}
