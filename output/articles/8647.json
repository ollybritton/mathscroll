{"title":"Kelvin transform","summary":"The Kelvin transform is a device used in classical potential theory to extend the concept of a harmonic function, by allowing the definition of a function which is 'harmonic at infinity'. This technique is also used in the study of subharmonic and superharmonic functions.","image":"338da1f57bf3e8682cb4c673466b7fb4d869a849.svg","url":"Kelvin_transform"}
