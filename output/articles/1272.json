{"title":"Baire space (set theory)","summary":"In set theory, the Baire space is the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers with a certain topology.  This space is commonly used in descriptive set theory, to the extent that its elements are often called \"reals\". It  is denoted NN, ωω, by the symbol N {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {N}}} or also ωω, not to be confused with the countable ordinal obtained by ordinal exponentiation.","image":"b7551c7bed2cd2ee83e10536d157c94a5f8f72fd.svg","url":"Baire_space_(set_theory)"}
