{"title":"Parabiaugmented hexagonal prism","summary":"In geometry, the parabiaugmented hexagonal prism is one of the Johnson solids (J55). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by doubly augmenting a hexagonal prism by attaching square pyramids (J1) to two of its nonadjacent, parallel (opposite) equatorial faces. Attaching the pyramids to nonadjacent, nonparallel equatorial faces yields a metabiaugmented hexagonal prism (J56). (The solid obtained by attaching pyramids to adjacent equatorial faces is not convex, and thus not a Johnson solid.)","image":"Parabiaugmented_hexagonal_prism.png.webp","url":"Parabiaugmented_hexagonal_prism"}
