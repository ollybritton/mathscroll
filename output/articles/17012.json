{"title":"Wolfe duality","summary":"In mathematical optimization, Wolfe duality, named after Philip Wolfe, is type of dual problem in which the objective function and constraints are all differentiable functions.  Using this concept a lower bound for a minimization problem can be found because of the weak duality principle.[1]","image":"a832e4077945f3ca15e87a8f0f96208355c78031.svg","url":"Wolfe_duality"}
