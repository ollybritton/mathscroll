{"title":"Forcing function (differential equations)","summary":"In a system of differential equations used to describe a time-dependent process, a forcing function is a function that appears in the equations and is only a function of time, and not of any of the other variables.[1][2]  In effect, it is a constant for each value of t.","image":"5bf044fe2fbfc4bd8d6d7230f4108430263f9fd6.svg","url":"Forcing_function_(differential_equations)"}
