{"title":"DSPACE","summary":"In computational complexity theory, DSPACE or SPACE is the computational resource describing the resource of memory space for a deterministic Turing machine.  It represents the total amount of memory space that a \"normal\" physical computer would need to solve a given computational problem with a given algorithm.","image":"2a5bc4b7383031ba693b7433198ead7170954c1d.svg","url":"DSPACE"}
