{"title":"Waterman polyhedron","summary":"In geometry, the Waterman polyhedra are a family of polyhedra discovered around 1990 by the mathematician Steve Waterman. A Waterman polyhedron is created by packing spheres according to the cubic close(st) packing (CCP), also known as the face-centered cubic (fcc) packing, then sweeping away the spheres that are farther from the center than a defined radius,[1] then creating the convex hull of the sphere centers.","image":"Waterman_Packed_Spheres_0024.1.png.webp","url":"Waterman_polyhedron"}
