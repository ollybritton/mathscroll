{"title":"Quarter cubic honeycomb","summary":"The quarter cubic honeycomb, quarter cubic cellulation or bitruncated alternated cubic honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 3-space.  It is composed of tetrahedra and truncated tetrahedra in a ratio of 1:1.  It is called \"quarter-cubic\" because its symmetry unit – the minimal block from which the pattern is developed by reflections – is four times that of the cubic honeycomb.","image":"Bitruncated_alternated_cubic_tiling.png.webp","url":"Quarter_cubic_honeycomb"}
