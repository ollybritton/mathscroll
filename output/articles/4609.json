{"title":"Edge and vertex spaces","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the edge  space and vertex space of an undirected graph are vector spaces defined in terms of the edge and vertex sets, respectively. These vector spaces make it possible to use techniques of linear algebra in studying the graph.","image":"12888b00298a689e66cc7c1c835c15928ba3d47a.svg","url":"Edge_and_vertex_spaces"}
