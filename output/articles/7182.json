{"title":"Heyting field","summary":"A Heyting field is one of the inequivalent ways in constructive mathematics to capture the classical notion of a field. It is essentially a field with an apartness relation. A commutative ring is a Heyting field if ¬ ( 0 = 1 ) {\\displaystyle (0=1)} , either a {\\displaystyle a} or 1 − a {\\displaystyle 1-a} is invertible for every a {\\displaystyle a} , and each noninvertible element is zero. The first two conditions say that the ring is local; the first and third conditions say that it is a field in the classical sense.","image":"73dcaae70bd038c7dc1d04daa0b68d00c752d5b6.svg","url":"Heyting_field"}
