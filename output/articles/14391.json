{"title":"Simon von Stampfer","summary":"Simon Ritter von Stampfer (26 October 1792 (according to other sources 1790)), in Windisch-Mattrai, Archbishopric of Salzburg today called Matrei in Osttirol, Tyrol – 10 November 1864 in Vienna) was an Austrian mathematician, surveyor and inventor. His most famous invention is that of the stroboscopic disk which has a claim to be the first device to show moving images. Almost simultaneously similar devices were produced independently in Belgium (the phenakistiskop), and Britain (the Dædaleum, years later to appear as the Zoetrope).","image":"Simon_Stampfer_Litho.jpg.webp","url":"Simon_von_Stampfer"}
