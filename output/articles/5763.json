{"title":"Frobenius algebra","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the fields of representation theory and module theory, a Frobenius algebra is a finite-dimensional unital associative algebra with a special kind of bilinear form which gives the algebras particularly nice duality theories.  Frobenius algebras began to be studied in the 1930s by Richard Brauer and Cecil Nesbitt and were named after Georg Frobenius. Tadashi Nakayama discovered the beginnings of a rich duality theory (Nakayama 1939), (Nakayama 1941). Jean Dieudonné used this to characterize Frobenius algebras (Dieudonné 1958).  Frobenius algebras were generalized to quasi-Frobenius rings, those Noetherian rings whose right regular representation is injective. In recent times, interest has been renewed in Frobenius algebras due to connections to topological quantum field theory.","image":"bd316a21eeb5079a850f223b1d096a06bfa788c0.svg","url":"Frobenius_algebra"}
