{"title":"Krull–Akizuki theorem","summary":"In algebra, the Krull–Akizuki theorem states the following: let A be a one-dimensional reduced noetherian ring,[1] K its total ring of fractions. If B is a subring of a finite extension L of K containing A then B is a one-dimensional noetherian ring. Furthermore, for every nonzero ideal I of B, B / I {\\displaystyle B/I} is finite over A.[2]","image":"e247d9e33f9921ba42fd3219101cd637e0097b6a.svg","url":"Krull–Akizuki_theorem"}
