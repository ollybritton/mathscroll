{"title":"List of triangle inequalities","summary":"In geometry, triangle inequalities are inequalities involving the parameters of triangles, that hold for every triangle, or for every triangle meeting certain conditions. The inequalities give an ordering of two different values: they are of the form \"less than\", \"less than or equal to\", \"greater than\", or \"greater than or equal to\". The parameters in a triangle inequality can be the side lengths, the semiperimeter, the angle measures, the values of trigonometric functions of those angles, the area of the triangle, the medians of the sides, the altitudes, the lengths of the internal angle bisectors from each angle to the opposite side, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, the distance from an arbitrary point to another point, the inradius, the exradii, the circumradius, and/or other quantities.","image":"9f13ead6cae57cf97fab76ad2f250b6f9a8ed04b.svg","url":"List_of_triangle_inequalities"}
