{"title":"Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial","summary":"In the mathematical field of representation theory, a Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial P y , w ( q ) {\\displaystyle P_{y,w}(q)} is a member of a family of integral polynomials introduced by David Kazhdan and George Lusztig (1979). They are indexed by pairs of elements y, w of a  Coxeter group W, which can in particular be the Weyl group of a Lie group.","image":"602c1c9d7528fd4fa7cb190dd15e50b8169eb6a4.svg","url":"Kazhdan–Lusztig_polynomial"}
