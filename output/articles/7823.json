{"title":"Inner model theory","summary":"In set theory, inner model theory is the study of certain models of ZFC or some fragment or strengthening thereof. Ordinarily these models are transitive subsets or subclasses of the von Neumann universe V, or sometimes of a generic extension of V. Inner model theory studies the relationships of these models to determinacy, large cardinals, and descriptive set theory. Despite the name, it is considered more a branch of set theory than of model theory.","image":"54ddec2e922c5caea4e47d04feef86e782dc8e6d.svg","url":"Inner_model_theory"}
