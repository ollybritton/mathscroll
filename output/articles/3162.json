{"title":"Condorcet winner criterion","summary":"An electoral system satisfies the Condorcet winner criterion (English:  /kɒndɔːrˈseɪ/) if it always chooses the Condorcet winner when one exists. The candidate who wins a majority of the vote in every head-to-head election against each of the other candidates – that is, a candidate preferred by more voters than any others – is the Condorcet winner, although Condorcet winners do not exist in all cases. It is sometimes simply referred to as the \"Condorcet criterion\", though it is very different from the \"Condorcet loser criterion\". Any voting method conforming to the Condorcet winner criterion is known as a Condorcet method. The Condorcet winner is the person who would win a two-candidate election against each of the other candidates in a plurality vote.[1][2] For a set of candidates, the Condorcet winner is always the same regardless of the voting system in question, and can be discovered by using pairwise counting on voters' ranked preferences.","image":"A_coloured_voting_box_(no_bg).svg.png.webp","url":"Condorcet_winner_criterion"}
