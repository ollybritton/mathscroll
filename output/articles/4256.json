{"title":"Discrete logarithm","summary":"In mathematics, for given real numbers a and b, the logarithm logb a is a number x such that bx = a. Analogously, in any group G, powers bk can be defined for all integers k, and the discrete logarithm logb a is an integer k such that bk = a. In number theory, the more commonly used term is index: we can write x = indr a (mod m) (read \"the index of a to the base r modulo m\") for rx ≡ a (mod m) if r is a primitive root of m and gcd(a,m) = 1.","image":"87082addff6e0f5425ff178c94b26a29b9904f6b.svg","url":"Discrete_logarithm"}
