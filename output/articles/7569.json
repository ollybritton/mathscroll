{"title":"II25,1","summary":"In mathematics, II25,1 is the even 26-dimensional Lorentzian unimodular lattice. It has several unusual properties, arising from Conway's discovery  that it has a norm zero Weyl vector. In particular it is closely related to the Leech lattice Î›, and has the Conway group Co1 at the top of its automorphism group.","image":"be8c746621a11662753ac73dc068d18d9f83f9a2.svg","url":"II25,1"}
