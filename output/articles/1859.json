{"title":"Borel summation","summary":"In mathematics,  Borel summation is a summation method for divergent series, introduced by Émile Borel (1899). It is particularly useful for summing divergent asymptotic series, and in some sense gives the best possible sum for such series. There are several variations of this method that are also called Borel summation, and a generalization of it called Mittag-Leffler summation.","image":"2d28d7014057bc2c6681db63f2bccc84e655a444.svg","url":"Borel_summation"}
