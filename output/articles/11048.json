{"title":"Newton polynomial","summary":"In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, a Newton polynomial, named after its inventor Isaac Newton,[1] is an interpolation polynomial for a given set of data points. The Newton polynomial is sometimes called Newton's divided differences interpolation polynomial because the coefficients of the polynomial are calculated using Newton's divided differences method.","image":"5e4f064b4751bb32d87cc829aca1b2b2f38d4a6d.svg","url":"Newton_polynomial"}
