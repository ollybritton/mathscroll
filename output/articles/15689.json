{"title":"Theorema Egregium","summary":"Gauss's Theorema Egregium (Latin for \"Remarkable Theorem\") is a major result of differential geometry, proved by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1827, that concerns the curvature of surfaces.  The theorem says that Gaussian curvature can be determined entirely by measuring angles, distances and their rates on a surface, without reference to the particular manner in which the surface is embedded in the ambient 3-dimensional Euclidean space.  In other words, the Gaussian curvature of a surface does not change if one bends the surface without stretching it.  Thus the Gaussian curvature is an intrinsic invariant of a surface.","image":"Mercator-proj.png.webp","url":"Theorema_Egregium"}
