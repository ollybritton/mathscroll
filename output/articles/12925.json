{"title":"Quasibarrelled space","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, quasibarrelled spaces are topological vector spaces (TVS) for which every bornivorous barrelled set in the space is a neighbourhood of the origin. Quasibarrelled spaces are studied because they are a weakening of the defining condition of barrelled spaces, for which a form of the Banachâ€“Steinhaus theorem holds.","image":"47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a.svg","url":"Quasibarrelled_space"}
