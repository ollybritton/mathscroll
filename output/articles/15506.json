{"title":"Tape correction (surveying)","summary":"In surveying, tape correction(s) refer(s) to correcting measurements for the effect of slope angle, expansion or contraction due to temperature, and the tape's sag, which varies with the applied tension. Not correcting for these effects gives rise to systematic errors, i.e. effects which act in a predictable manner and therefore can be corrected by mathematical methods.","image":"Diagram_of_simple_slope_correction.svg.png.webp","url":"Tape_correction_(surveying)"}
