{"title":"Godement resolution","summary":"The Godement resolution of a sheaf is a construction in homological algebra that allows one to view global, cohomological information about the sheaf in terms of local information coming from its stalks.  It is useful for computing sheaf cohomology.  It was discovered by Roger Godement.","image":"42a5cd09a98f2ead3430e7772aff4b7a6198e369.svg","url":"Godement_resolution"}
