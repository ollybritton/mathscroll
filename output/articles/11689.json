{"title":"p-value","summary":"In null-hypothesis significance testing, the p-value[note 1] is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the result actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct.[2][3] A very small p-value means that such an extreme observed outcome would be very unlikely under the null hypothesis. Reporting p-values of statistical tests is common practice in academic publications of many quantitative fields. Since the precise meaning of p-value is hard to grasp, misuse is widespread and has been a major topic in metascience.[4][5]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"P-value"}
