{"title":"Laves graph","summary":"In geometry and crystallography, the Laves graph is an infinite and highly symmetric system of points and line segments in three-dimensional Euclidean space, forming a periodic graph. Three equal-length segments meet at 120Â° angles at each point, and all cycles use ten or more segments. It is the shortest possible triply periodic graph, relative to the volume of its fundamental domain. One arrangement of the Laves graph uses one out of every eight of the points in the integer lattice as its points, and connects all pairs of these points that are nearest neighbors, at distance 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}} . It can also be defined, divorced from its geometry, as an abstract undirected graph, a covering graph of the complete graph on four vertices.","image":"b4afc1e27d418021bf10898eb44a7f5f315735ff.svg","url":"Laves_graph"}
