{"title":"Cayley configuration space","summary":"In mathematics, the Cayley configuration space of a linkage over a set of its non-edges F {\\displaystyle F} , called Cayley parameters, is the set of distances attained by F {\\displaystyle F} over all its frameworks, under some l p {\\displaystyle l_{p}} -norm.  In other words, each framework of the linkage prescribes a unique set of distances to the non-edges of G {\\displaystyle G} , so the set of all frameworks can be described by the set of distances attained by any subset of these non-edges.  Note that this description may not be a bijection.  The motivation for using distance parameters is to define a continuous quadratic branched covering from the configuration space of a linkage to a simpler, often convex, space.  Hence, obtaining a framework from a Cayley configuration space of a linkage over some set of non-edges is often a matter of solving quadratic equations.","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"Cayley_configuration_space"}
