{"title":"Whittaker model","summary":"In representation theory, a branch of mathematics, the Whittaker model is a realization of a representation of a reductive algebraic group such as GL2 over a finite or local or global field on a space of functions on the group. It is named after E. T. Whittaker even though he never worked in this area, because (JacquetÂ 1966, 1967) pointed out that for the group SL2(R)  some of the functions involved in the representation are Whittaker functions.","image":"ce1e673a663d496ddf5fbaccd882064e3408d6c8.svg","url":"Whittaker_model"}
