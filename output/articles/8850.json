{"title":"Kronecker–Weber theorem","summary":"In algebraic number theory, it can be shown that every cyclotomic field is an abelian extension of the rational number field Q, having Galois group of the form ( Z / n Z ) × {\\displaystyle (\\mathbb {Z} /n\\mathbb {Z} )^{\\times }} . The Kronecker–Weber theorem provides a partial converse: every finite abelian extension of Q is contained within some cyclotomic field. In other words, every algebraic integer whose Galois group is abelian can be expressed as a sum of roots of unity with rational coefficients.
