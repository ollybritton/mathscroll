{"title":"Law (stochastic processes)","summary":"In mathematics, the law of a stochastic process is the measure that the process induces on the collection of functions from the index set into the state space.  The law encodes a lot of information about the process; in the case of a random walk, for example, the law is the probability distribution of the possible trajectories of the walk.","image":"0e209115048f9a3325fa4d3763e4a934bd9315a7.svg","url":"Law_(stochastic_processes)"}
