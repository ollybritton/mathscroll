{"title":"Degree matrix","summary":"In the mathematical field of algebraic graph theory, the degree matrix of an undirected graph is a diagonal matrix which contains information about the degree of each vertexâ€”that is, the number of edges attached to each vertex.[1] It is used together with the adjacency matrix to construct the Laplacian matrix of a graph: the Laplacian matrix is the difference of the degree matrix and the adjacency matrix.[2]","image":"644a8d85ee410b6159ca2bdb5dcb9097e2c8f182.svg","url":"Degree_matrix"}
