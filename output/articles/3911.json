{"title":"Dehn–Sommerville equations","summary":"In mathematics, the Dehn–Sommerville equations are a complete set of linear relations between the numbers of faces of different dimension of a simplicial polytope. For polytopes of dimension 4 and 5, they were found by Max Dehn in 1905.  Their general form was established by Duncan Sommerville in 1927. The Dehn–Sommerville equations can be restated as a symmetry condition for the h-vector of the simplicial polytope and this has become the standard formulation in recent combinatorics literature. By duality, analogous equations hold for simple polytopes.","image":"ebe43d9a728beb9bcd0eda1473cc1c0fee6fd53e.svg","url":"Dehn–Sommerville_equations"}
