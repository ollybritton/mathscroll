{"title":"Lebedev quadrature","summary":"In numerical analysis, Lebedev quadrature, named after Vyacheslav Ivanovich Lebedev, is an approximation to the surface integral of a function over a three-dimensional sphere. The grid is constructed so to have octahedral rotation and inversion symmetry. The number and location of the grid points together with a corresponding set of integration weights are determined by enforcing the exact integration of polynomials (or equivalently, spherical harmonics) up to a given order, leading to a sequence of increasingly dense grids analogous to the one-dimensional  Gauss-Legendre scheme.","image":"512005c2dfe93adab88edd0022c21a406e4d5606.svg","url":"Lebedev_quadrature"}
