{"title":"Chevalley–Warning theorem","summary":"In number theory, the  Chevalley–Warning theorem implies that certain polynomial equations in sufficiently many variables over a finite field have solutions. It was proved by Ewald Warning (1935) and a slightly weaker form of the theorem, known as Chevalley's theorem, was proved by Chevalley (1935). Chevalley's theorem implied Artin's and Dickson's conjecture that finite fields are quasi-algebraically closed fields (Artin 1982, page x).","image":"573f72afae7df709959ab1a58cd643743466a187.svg","url":"Chevalley–Warning_theorem"}
