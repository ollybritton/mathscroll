{"title":"Flow (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a flow formalizes the idea of the motion of particles in a fluid.  Flows are ubiquitous in science, including engineering and physics. The notion of flow is basic to the study of ordinary differential equations. Informally, a flow may be viewed as a continuous motion of points over time. More formally, a flow is a group action of the real numbers on a set.","image":"PenduleEspaceDesPhases.png.webp","url":"Flow_(mathematics)"}
