{"title":"Spectral density","summary":"The power spectrum S x x ( f ) {\\displaystyle S_{xx}(f)} of a time series x ( t ) {\\displaystyle x(t)} describes the distribution of power into frequency components composing that signal.[1]  According to Fourier analysis, any physical signal can be decomposed into a number of discrete frequencies, or a spectrum of frequencies over a continuous range. The statistical average of a certain signal or sort of signal (including noise) as analyzed in terms of its frequency content, is called its spectrum.","image":"cab836aa57df700d834cc0f736e9f81152fa470e.svg","url":"Spectral_density"}
