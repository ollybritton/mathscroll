{"title":"Total subset","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in functional analysis, a subset T {\\displaystyle T} of a topological vector space X {\\displaystyle X} is said to be a total subset of X {\\displaystyle X} if the linear span of T {\\displaystyle T} is a dense subset of X . {\\displaystyle X.} [1] This condition arises frequently in many theorems of functional analysis.","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Total_subset"}
