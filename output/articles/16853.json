{"title":"Weyl's lemma (Laplace equation)","summary":"In mathematics, Weyl's lemma, named after Hermann Weyl, states that every weak solution of Laplace's equation is a smooth solution. This contrasts with the wave equation, for example, which has weak solutions that are not smooth solutions. Weyl's lemma is a special case of elliptic or  hypoelliptic regularity.","image":"24b0d5ca6f381068d756f6337c08e0af9d1eeb6f.svg","url":"Weyl's_lemma_(Laplace_equation)"}
