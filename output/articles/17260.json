{"title":"∞-groupoid","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, an ∞-groupoid is an abstract homotopical model for topological spaces. One model uses Kan complexes which are fibrant objects in the category of simplicial sets (with the standard model structure).[1] It is an ∞-category generalization of a groupoid, a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism.","image":"6df6ffb3d7e5214ab2f1d7c5b3915ca050523cf9.svg","url":"∞-groupoid"}
