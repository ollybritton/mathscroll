{"title":"Conductance (graph)","summary":"In graph theory the conductance of a graph G = (V, E) measures how \"well-knit\" the graph is: it controls how fast a random walk on G converges to its stationary distribution. The conductance of a graph is often called the Cheeger constant of a graph as the analog of its counterpart in spectral geometry. Since electrical networks are intimately related to random walks with a long history in the usage of the term \"conductance\", this alternative name helps avoid possible confusion.","image":"Internet_map_1024.jpg.webp","url":"Conductance_(graph)"}
