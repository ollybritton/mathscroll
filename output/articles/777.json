{"title":"Anderson acceleration","summary":"In mathematics, Anderson acceleration, also called Anderson mixing, is a method for the acceleration of the convergence rate of fixed-point iterations. Introduced by Donald G. Anderson,[1] this technique can be used to find the solution to fixed point equations f ( x ) = x {\\displaystyle f(x)=x} often arising in the field of computational science.","image":"f690285952308aa49e3c6aac892df31cad6d1b06.svg","url":"Anderson_acceleration"}
