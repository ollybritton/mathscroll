{"title":"Multisymplectic integrator","summary":"In mathematics, a multisymplectic integrator is a numerical method for the solution of a certain class of partial differential equations, that are said to be multisymplectic. Multisymplectic integrators are geometric integrators, meaning that they preserve the geometry of the problems; in particular, the numerical method preserves energy and momentum in some sense, similar to the partial differential equation itself. Examples of multisymplectic integrators include the Euler box scheme and the Preissman box scheme.","image":"e2e392206ebce149df75f6fbb8553856c319b269.svg","url":"Multisymplectic_integrator"}
