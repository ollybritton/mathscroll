{"title":"Demihypercube","summary":"In geometry, demihypercubes (also called n-demicubes, n-hemicubes, and half measure polytopes) are a class of n-polytopes constructed from alternation of an n-hypercube, labeled as hγn for being half of the hypercube family, γn. Half of the vertices are deleted and new facets are formed. The 2n facets become 2n (n−1)-demicubes, and 2n (n−1)-simplex facets are formed in place of the deleted vertices.[1]","image":"CubeAndStel.svg.png.webp","url":"Demihypercube"}
