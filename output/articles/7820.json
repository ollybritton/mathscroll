{"title":"Inner automorphism","summary":"In abstract algebra an inner automorphism is an automorphism of a group, ring, or algebra given by the conjugation action of a fixed element, called the conjugating element. They can be realized via simple operations from within the group itself, hence the adjective \"inner\". These inner automorphisms form a subgroup of the automorphism group, and the quotient of the automorphism group by this subgroup is defined as the outer automorphism group.","image":"e9f7501362cce33fd6c99b2dd0ddb11c86a5a753.svg","url":"Inner_automorphism"}
