{"title":"Topological K-theory","summary":"In mathematics, topological K-theory is a branch of algebraic topology. It was founded to study vector bundles on topological spaces, by means of ideas now recognised as (general) K-theory that were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck. The early work on topological K-theory is due to Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch.","image":"8bf4d723f5664de728ebf62b66da9f83cb55d4fe.svg","url":"Topological_K-theory"}
