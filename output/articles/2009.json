{"title":"Brownian dynamics","summary":"Brownian dynamics (BD) can be used to describe the motion of molecules for example in molecular simulations or in reality. It is a simplified version of Langevin dynamics and corresponds to the limit where no average acceleration takes place. This approximation can also be described as 'overdamped' Langevin dynamics, or as Langevin dynamics without inertia.","image":"8dfc0e770fd6b84f892b217e930ef67eae412e97.svg","url":"Brownian_dynamics"}
