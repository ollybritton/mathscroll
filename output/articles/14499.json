{"title":"Skolem's paradox","summary":"In mathematical logic and philosophy, Skolem's paradox is a seeming contradiction that arises from the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem. Thoralf Skolem (1922) was the first to discuss the seemingly contradictory aspects of the theorem, and to discover the relativity of set-theoretic notions now known as non-absoluteness. Although it is not an actual antinomy like Russell's paradox, the result is typically called a paradox and was described as a \"paradoxical state of affairs\" by Skolem (1922: p. 295).","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Skolem's_paradox"}
