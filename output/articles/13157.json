{"title":"Rauch comparison theorem","summary":"In Riemannian geometry, the Rauch comparison theorem, named after Harry Rauch, who proved it in 1951, is a fundamental result which relates the sectional curvature of a Riemannian manifold to the rate at which geodesics spread apart.  Intuitively, it states that for positive curvature, geodesics tend to converge, while for negative curvature, geodesics tend to spread.","image":"6e5c290379a58a7ea289d3a9cddf2e2e7ce92b07.svg","url":"Rauch_comparison_theorem"}
