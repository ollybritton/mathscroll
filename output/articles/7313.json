{"title":"Hjelmslev transformation","summary":"In mathematics, the Hjelmslev transformation is an effective method for mapping an entire hyperbolic plane into a circle with a finite radius. The transformation was invented by Danish mathematician Johannes Hjelmslev. It utilizes Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky's 23rd theorem from his work Geometrical Investigations on the Theory of Parallels.","image":"Hjconstruction.svg.png.webp","url":"Hjelmslev_transformation"}
