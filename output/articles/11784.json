{"title":"Parallel single-source shortest path algorithm","summary":"A central problem in algorithmic graph theory is the shortest path problem. One of the generalizations of the shortest path problem is known as the single-source-shortest-paths (SSSP) problem, which consists of finding the shortest paths from a source vertex s {\\displaystyle s} to all other vertices in the graph. There are classical sequential algorithms which solve this problem, such as Dijkstra's algorithm. In this article, however, we present two parallel algorithms solving this problem.","image":"01d131dfd7673938b947072a13a9744fe997e632.svg","url":"Parallel_single-source_shortest_path_algorithm"}
