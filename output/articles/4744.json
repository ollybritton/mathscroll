{"title":"Elliptic Gauss sum","summary":"In mathematics, an elliptic Gauss sum is an analog of a Gauss sum depending on an elliptic curve with complex multiplication. The quadratic residue symbol in a Gauss sum is replaced by a higher residue symbol such as a cubic or quartic residue symbol, and the exponential function in a Gauss sum is replaced by an elliptic function. They were introduced by EisensteinÂ (1850), at least in the lemniscate case when the elliptic curve has complex multiplication by i, but seem to have been forgotten or ignored until the paper (Pinch 1988).","image":"63fbc3021f7b87d0f36f8bd04f7f68edc4048ee5.svg","url":"Elliptic_Gauss_sum"}
