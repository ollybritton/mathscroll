{"title":"Fibrifold","summary":"In mathematics, a  fibrifold is (roughly) a fiber space whose fibers and base spaces are orbifolds. They were introduced by John Horton Conway, Olaf Delgado Friedrichs, and Daniel H. Huson et al.Â (2001), who introduced a system of notation for 3-dimensional fibrifolds and used this  to assign names to the 219 affine space group types. 184 of these are considered reducible, and 35 irreducible.","image":"35_cubic_fibrifold_groups.png.webp","url":"Fibrifold"}
