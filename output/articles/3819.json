{"title":"De Bruijn's theorem","summary":"In a 1969 paper, Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn proved several results about packing congruent rectangular bricks (of any dimension) into larger rectangular boxes, in such a way that no space is left over. One of these results is now known as de Bruijn's theorem. According to this theorem, a \"harmonic brick\" (one in which each side length is a multiple of the next smaller side length) can only be packed into a box whose dimensions are multiples of the brick's dimensions.[1]","image":"De_Bruijn_theorem_coloring.svg.png.webp","url":"De_Bruijn's_theorem"}
