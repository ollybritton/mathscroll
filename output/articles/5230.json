{"title":"Extreme value theorem","summary":"In calculus, the extreme value theorem states that if a real-valued function f {\\displaystyle f} is continuous on the closed interval [ a , b ] {\\displaystyle [a,b]} , then f {\\displaystyle f} must attain a maximum and a minimum, each at least once. That is, there exist numbers c {\\displaystyle c} and d {\\displaystyle d} in [ a , b ] {\\displaystyle [a,b]} such that:","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Extreme_value_theorem"}
