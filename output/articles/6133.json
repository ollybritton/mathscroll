{"title":"Geometric Poisson distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the geometric Poisson distribution (also called the Pólya–Aeppli distribution) is used for describing objects that come in clusters, where the number of clusters follows a Poisson distribution and the number of objects within a cluster follows a geometric distribution.[1] It is a particular case of the compound Poisson distribution.[2]","image":"586230baae8fdd2b2722e473630353c175be0d68.svg","url":"Geometric_Poisson_distribution"}
