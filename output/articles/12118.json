{"title":"Phase line (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a phase line is a diagram that shows the qualitative behaviour of an autonomous ordinary differential equation in a single variable, d y d x = f ( y ) {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {dy}{dx}}=f(y)} . The phase line is the 1-dimensional form of the general n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional phase space, and can be readily analyzed.","image":"61fec89c3e3a59af41d499922f882f100d54af22.svg","url":"Phase_line_(mathematics)"}
