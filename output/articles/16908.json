{"title":"Wiener series","summary":"In mathematics, the Wiener series, or Wiener G-functional expansion, originates from the 1958 book of Norbert Wiener. It is an orthogonal expansion for nonlinear functionals closely related to the Volterra series and having the same relation to it as an orthogonal Hermite polynomial expansion has to a power series. For this reason it is also known as the Wiener–Hermite expansion. The analogue of the coefficients are referred to as Wiener kernels.  The terms of the series are orthogonal (uncorrelated) with respect to a statistical input of white noise.  This property allows the terms to be identified in applications by the Lee–Schetzen method.","image":"b7b80868600db89fef84e4d41317b7c8a1e0d047.svg","url":"Wiener_series"}
