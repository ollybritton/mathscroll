{"title":"Ultraproduct","summary":"The ultraproduct is a mathematical construction that appears mainly in abstract algebra and mathematical logic, in particular in model theory and set theory. An ultraproduct is a quotient of the direct product of a family of structures. All factors need to have the same signature. The ultrapower is the special case of this construction in which all factors are equal.","image":"a12504e3a6f191d6fb24fb4a6795266bdd171664.svg","url":"Ultraproduct"}
