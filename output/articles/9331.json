{"title":"Line (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a line is an infinitely long object with no width, depth, or curvature. Thus, lines are one-dimensional objects, though they may exist embedded in two, three, or higher dimension spaces. The word line may also refer to a line segment in everyday life, which has two points to denote its ends (endpoints). A line can be referred to by two points that lie on it (e.g. A B ↔ {\\textstyle {\\overleftrightarrow {AB}}} ) or by a single letter (e.g. ℓ {\\displaystyle \\ell } ).","image":"b0523064e5c4b39cf2321a2205381e95b9ea330c.svg","url":"Line_(geometry)"}
