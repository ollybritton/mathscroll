{"title":"Kostant partition function","summary":"In representation theory, a branch of mathematics, the Kostant partition function, introduced by Bertram Kostant (1958, 1959), of a root system Δ {\\displaystyle \\Delta } is the number of ways one can represent a vector (weight) as a non-negative integer linear combination of the positive roots Δ + ⊂ Δ {\\displaystyle \\Delta ^{+}\\subset \\Delta } .  Kostant used it to rewrite the Weyl character formula as a formula (the Kostant multiplicity formula) for the multiplicity of a weight of an irreducible representation of a semisimple Lie algebra. An alternative formula, that is more computationally efficient in some cases, is Freudenthal's formula.","image":"32769037c408874e1890f77554c65f39c523ebe2.svg","url":"Kostant_partition_function"}
