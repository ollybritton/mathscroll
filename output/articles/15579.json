{"title":"Tensor sketch","summary":"In statistics, machine learning and algorithms, a tensor sketch is a type of dimensionality reduction that is particularly efficient when applied to vectors that have tensor structure.[1][2] Such a sketch can be used to speed up explicit kernel methods, bilinear pooling in neural networks and is a cornerstone in many numerical linear algebra algorithms.[3]","image":"Kernel_Machine.svg.png.webp","url":"Tensor_sketch"}
