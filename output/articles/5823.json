{"title":"Function problem","summary":"In computational complexity theory, a function problem is a computational problem where a single output (of a total function) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem. For function problems, the output is not simply 'yes' or 'no'.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Function_problem"}
