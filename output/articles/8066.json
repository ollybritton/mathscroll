{"title":"Isolated singularity","summary":"In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, an isolated singularity is one that has no other singularities close to it. In other words, a complex number z0 is an isolated singularity of a function f if there exists an open disk D centered at z0 such that f is holomorphic on D \\ {z0}, that is, on the set obtained from D by taking z0 out.","image":"Gamma_abs_3D.png.webp","url":"Isolated_singularity"}
