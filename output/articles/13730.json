{"title":"Rota–Baxter algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Rota–Baxter algebra is an associative algebra, together with a particular linear map R which satisfies the Rota–Baxter identity. It appeared first in the work of the American mathematician Glen E. Baxter[1]  in the realm of probability theory. Baxter's work was further explored from different angles by Gian-Carlo Rota,[2][3][4] Pierre Cartier,[5] and Frederic V. Atkinson,[6] among others. Baxter’s derivation of this identity that later bore his name emanated from some of the fundamental results of the famous probabilist Frank Spitzer in random walk theory.[7][8]","image":"b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a.svg","url":"Rota–Baxter_algebra"}
