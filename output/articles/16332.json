{"title":"Undecidable problem","summary":"In computability theory and computational complexity theory, an undecidable problem is a decision problem for which it is proved to be impossible to construct an algorithm that always leads to a correct yes-or-no answer.[1] The halting problem is an example: it can be proven that there is no algorithm that correctly determines whether arbitrary programs eventually halt when run.[2]","image":"7c3eac9e230a7c68b89e70dd4ed545a3b2a80b1b.svg","url":"Undecidable_problem"}
