{"title":"Sklyanin algebra","summary":"In mathematics, specifically the field of algebra, Sklyanin algebras are a class of noncommutative algebra named after Evgeny Sklyanin. This class of algebras was first studied in the classification of Artin-Schelter regular[1] algebras of global dimension 3 in the 1980s.[2] Sklyanin algebras can be grouped into two different types, the non-degenerate Sklyanin algebras and the degenerate Sklyanin algebras, which have very different properties. A need to understand the non-degenerate Sklyanin algebras better has led to the development of the study of point modules in noncommutative geometry.[2]","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Sklyanin_algebra"}
