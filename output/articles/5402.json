{"title":"Field extension","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in algebra, a field extension is a pair of fields K âŠ† L , {\\displaystyle K\\subseteq L,} such that the operations of K are those of L restricted to K. In this case, L is an extension field of K and K is a subfield of L.[1][2][3] For example, under the usual notions of addition and multiplication, the complex numbers are an extension field of the real numbers; the real numbers are a subfield of the complex numbers.","image":"37cbccdf22d76df45e85203994aae6cfefd1c96c.svg","url":"Field_extension"}
