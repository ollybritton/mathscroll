{"title":"Mathematical discussion of rangekeeping","summary":"In naval gunnery, when long-range guns became available, an enemy ship would move some distance after the shells were fired. It became necessary to figure out where the enemy ship, the target, was going to be when the shells arrived. The process of keeping track of where the ship was likely to be was called rangekeeping, because the distance to the target—the range—was a very important factor in aiming the guns accurately. As time passed, train (also called bearing), the direction to the target, also became part of rangekeeping, but tradition kept the term alive.","image":"RangekeeperCoordinateSystem.png.webp","url":"Mathematical_discussion_of_rangekeeping"}
