{"title":"Triangular bifrustum","summary":"In geometry, the triangular bifrustum is the second in an infinite series of bifrustum polyhedra. It has 6 trapezoid and 2 triangle faces. It may also be called the truncated triangular bipyramid; however, that term is ambiguous, as it may also refer to polyhedra formed by truncating all five vertices of a triangular bipyramid.[1]","image":"Dual_elongated_triangular_dipyramid.png.webp","url":"Triangular_bifrustum"}
