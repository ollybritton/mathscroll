{"title":"List of finite spherical symmetry groups","summary":"Finite spherical symmetry groups are also called point groups in three dimensions. There are five fundamental symmetry classes which have triangular fundamental domains: dihedral, cyclic, tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral symmetry.","image":"Sphere_symmetry_group_cs.png.webp","url":"List_of_finite_spherical_symmetry_groups"}
