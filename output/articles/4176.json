{"title":"Direct integral","summary":"In mathematics and functional analysis a direct integral or Hilbert integral is a generalization of the concept of direct sum. The theory is most developed for direct integrals of Hilbert spaces and direct integrals of von Neumann algebras. The concept was introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann in one of the papers in the series On Rings of Operators. One of von Neumann's goals in this paper was to reduce the classification of (what are now called) von Neumann algebras on separable Hilbert spaces to the classification of so-called factors. Factors are analogous to full matrix algebras over a field, and von Neumann wanted to prove a continuous analogue of the Artinâ€“Wedderburn theorem classifying semi-simple rings.","image":"eb2e4095a53de7ada9f8dcd852316cff1f810774.svg","url":"Direct_integral"}
