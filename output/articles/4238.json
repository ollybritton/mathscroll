{"title":"Discrete-time Markov chain","summary":"In probability, a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) is a sequence of random variables, known as a stochastic process, in which the value of the next variable depends only on the value of the current variable, and not any variables in the past. For instance, a machine may have two states, A and E. When it is in state A, there is a 40% chance of it moving to state E and a 60% chance of it remaining in state A. When it is in state E, there is a 70% chance of it moving to A and a 30% chance of it staying in E. The sequence of states of the machine is a Markov chain. If we denote the chain by X 0 , X 1 , X 2 , . . . {\\displaystyle X_{0},X_{1},X_{2},...} then X 0 {\\displaystyle X_{0}} is the state which the machine starts in and X 10 {\\displaystyle X_{10}} is the random variable describing its state after 10 transitions. The process continues forever, indexed by the natural numbers.","image":"4e597c7a7aebad9d8017b2accb910f8217ea6bdf.svg","url":"Discrete-time_Markov_chain"}
