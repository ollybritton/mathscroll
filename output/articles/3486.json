{"title":"Counting Bloom filter","summary":"A counting Bloom filter is a generalized data structure of Bloom filter, that is used to test whether a count number of a given element is smaller than a given threshold when a sequence of elements is given. As a generalized form of Bloom filter, false positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not â€“ in other words, a query returns either \"possibly bigger or equal than the threshold\" or \"definitely smaller than the threshold\".","image":"101a52e1309a2dd16a1d0b920fd57aeec2fbbad4.svg","url":"Counting_Bloom_filter"}
