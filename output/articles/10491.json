{"title":"Minimal surface of revolution","summary":"In mathematics, a minimal surface of revolution or minimum surface of revolution is a surface of revolution defined from two points in a half-plane, whose boundary is the axis of revolution of the surface. It is generated by a curve that lies in the half-plane and connects the two points; among all the surfaces that can be generated in this way, it is the one that minimizes the surface area.[1] A basic problem in the calculus of variations is finding the curve between two points that produces this minimal surface of revolution.[1]","image":"Bulle_caténoïde.png.webp","url":"Minimal_surface_of_revolution"}
