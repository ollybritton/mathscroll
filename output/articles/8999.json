{"title":"Landen's transformation","summary":"Landen's transformation is a mapping of the parameters of an elliptic integral, useful for the efficient numerical evaluation of elliptic functions. It was originally due to John Landen and independently rediscovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss.[1]","image":"d722bb777215ec65a65665d3d17af1e90bcd9950.svg","url":"Landen's_transformation"}
