{"title":"Löschian number","summary":"In number theory, the numbers of the form x2 + xy + y2 for integer x, y are called the Löschian numbers (or Loeschian numbers). These numbers are named after August Lösch. They are the norms of the Eisenstein integers. They are a set of whole numbers, including zero, and having prime factorization in which all primes congruent to 2 mod 3 have even powers (there is no restriction of primes congruent to 0 or 1 mod 3).","image":"b5606a4c05ea718ec23fa0bd3fde31cfe0bc369e.svg","url":"Löschian_number"}
