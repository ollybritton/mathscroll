{"title":"Automatic group","summary":"In mathematics, an automatic group is a finitely generated group equipped with several finite-state automata. These automata represent the Cayley graph of the group.  That is, they can tell if a given word representation of a group element is in a \"canonical form\" and can tell if two elements given in canonical words differ by a generator.[1]","image":"5541bfa07743be995242c892c344395e672d6fa2.svg","url":"Automatic_group"}
