{"title":"Gradient-related","summary":"Gradient-related is a term used in multivariable calculus to describe a direction. A direction sequence { d k } {\\displaystyle \\{d^{k}\\}} is gradient-related to { x k } {\\displaystyle \\{x^{k}\\}} if for any subsequence { x k } k ∈ K {\\displaystyle \\{x^{k}\\}_{k\\in K}} that converges to a nonstationary point, the corresponding subsequence { d k } k ∈ K {\\displaystyle \\{d^{k}\\}_{k\\in K}} is bounded and satisfies","image":"474a4f3237987583e1b938e2f2b934169c6f50fc.svg","url":"Gradient-related"}
