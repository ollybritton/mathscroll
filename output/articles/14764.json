{"title":"Sperner's lemma","summary":"In mathematics, Sperner's lemma is a combinatorial result on colorings of triangulations, analogous to the Brouwer fixed point theorem, which is equivalent to it.[1] It states that every Sperner coloring (described below) of a triangulation of an n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional simplex contains a cell whose vertices all have different colors.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Sperner's_lemma"}
