{"title":"Skeleton (category theory)","summary":"In mathematics, a skeleton of a category is a subcategory that, roughly speaking, does not contain any extraneous isomorphisms. In a certain sense, the skeleton of a category is the \"smallest\" equivalent category, which captures all \"categorical properties\" of the original. In fact, two categories are equivalent if and only if they have isomorphic skeletons. A category is called skeletal if isomorphic objects are necessarily identical.","image":"f632c9b6ccacb2468fb9fec5e88122a13e4c4af2.svg","url":"Skeleton_(category_theory)"}
