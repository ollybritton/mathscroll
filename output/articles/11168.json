{"title":"Noncommutative symmetric function","summary":"In mathematics, the noncommutative symmetric functions form a Hopf algebra NSymm analogous to the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions. The Hopf algebra NSymm was introduced by Israel M. Gelfand, Daniel Krob, Alain Lascoux, Bernard Leclerc, Vladimir Retakh, and Jean-Yves Thibon.[1] It is noncommutative but cocommutative graded Hopf algebra. It has the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions as a quotient, and is a subalgebra of the Hopf algebra of permutations, and is the graded dual of the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric function. Over the rational numbers it is isomorphic as a Hopf algebra to the universal enveloping algebra of the free Lie algebra on countably many variables.","image":"68cc0c09ffb14899d83052e83d8b480f19510b46.svg","url":"Noncommutative_symmetric_function"}
