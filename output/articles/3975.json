{"title":"Dependent type","summary":"In computer science and logic, a dependent type is a type whose definition depends on a value. It is an overlapping feature of type theory and type systems. In intuitionistic type theory, dependent types are used to encode logic's quantifiers like \"for all\" and \"there exists\". In functional programming languages like Agda, ATS, Coq, F*, Epigram, and Idris, dependent types help reduce bugs by enabling the programmer to assign types that further restrain the set of possible implementations.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Dependent_type"}
