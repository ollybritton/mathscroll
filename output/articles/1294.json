{"title":"Banach fixed-point theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Banach fixed-point theorem (also known as the contraction mapping theorem or contractive mapping theorem or Banach-Caccioppoli theorem) is an important tool in the theory of metric spaces; it guarantees the existence and uniqueness of fixed points of certain self-maps of metric spaces, and provides a constructive method to find those fixed points. It can be understood as an abstract formulation of Picard's method of successive approximations.[1] The theorem is named after Stefan Banach (1892â€“1945) who first stated it in 1922.[2][3]","image":"cb4d7a16bca9e216c0221b43a1c3377aa5e358b8.svg","url":"Banach_fixed-point_theorem"}
