{"title":"Borel–Cantelli lemma","summary":"In probability theory, the Borel–Cantelli lemma is a theorem about sequences of events. In general, it is a result in measure theory.  It is named after Émile Borel and Francesco Paolo Cantelli, who gave statement to the lemma in the first decades of the 20th century.[1][2]  A related result, sometimes called the second Borel–Cantelli lemma, is a partial converse of the first Borel–Cantelli lemma.  The lemma states that, under certain conditions, an event will have probability of either zero or one. Accordingly, it is the best-known of a class of similar theorems, known as zero-one laws. Other examples include Kolmogorov's zero–one law and the Hewitt–Savage zero–one law.","image":"be73884f2af3df63e059ae0e9b1a44c13f4382e2.svg","url":"Borel–Cantelli_lemma"}
