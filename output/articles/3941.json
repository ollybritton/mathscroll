{"title":"Demazure module","summary":"In mathematics, a  Demazure module, introduced by Demazure (1974a, 1974b), is a submodule of a finite-dimensional representation generated by an extremal weight space under the action of a Borel subalgebra. The Demazure character formula, introduced by Demazure (1974b, theorem 2),  gives the characters of Demazure modules, and is a generalization of the Weyl character formula. The dimension of a Demazure module is a polynomial in the highest weight, called a Demazure polynomial.","image":"9fcc7473acfaddff77ff3c198b2209350bd995b8.svg","url":"Demazure_module"}
