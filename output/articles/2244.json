{"title":"Carleman linearization","summary":"In mathematics, Carleman linearization (or Carleman embedding) is a technique to transform a finite-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional linear system. It was introduced by the Swedish mathematician Torsten Carleman in 1923.[1] Carleman linearization is related to composition operator and has been widely used in the study of dynamical systems. It also been used in many applied fields, such as in control theory[2][3] and in quantum computing.[4][5]","image":"23fbf993b5945a96f6f3b801adfda65d1a8a635a.svg","url":"Carleman_linearization"}
