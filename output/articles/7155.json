{"title":"Hexagonal bifrustum","summary":"The hexagonal bifrustum or truncated hexagonal bipyramid is the fourth in an infinite series of bifrustum polyhedra. It has 12 trapezoid and 2 hexagonal faces. This polyhedron can be constructed by taking a hexagonal dipyramid and truncating the polar axis vertices, making it into two end-to-end frustums.","image":"Hexagonal_bifrustum.png.webp","url":"Hexagonal_bifrustum"}
