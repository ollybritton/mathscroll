{"title":"Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem (sometimes simply called Bombieri's theorem) is a major result of analytic number theory, obtained in the mid-1960s, concerning the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, averaged over a range of moduli. The first result of this kind was obtained by Mark Barban in 1961[1] and the Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem is a refinement of Barban's result. The Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem is named after Enrico Bombieri[2] and A. I. Vinogradov,[3] who published on a related topic, the density hypothesis, in 1965.","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Bombieri–Vinogradov_theorem"}
