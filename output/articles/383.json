{"title":"Adjoint bundle","summary":"In mathematics, an adjoint bundle [1] is a vector bundle naturally associated to any principal bundle. The fibers of the adjoint bundle carry a Lie algebra structure making the adjoint bundle into a (nonassociative) algebra bundle. Adjoint bundles have important applications in the theory of connections as well as in gauge theory.","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Adjoint_bundle"}
