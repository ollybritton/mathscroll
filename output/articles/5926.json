{"title":"Gale–Ryser theorem","summary":"The Gale–Ryser theorem is a result in graph theory and combinatorial matrix theory, two branches of combinatorics. It provides one of two known approaches to solving the bipartite realization problem, i.e. it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for two finite sequences of natural numbers to be the degree sequence of a labeled simple bipartite graph; a sequence obeying these conditions is called \"bigraphic\". It is an analog of the Erdős–Gallai theorem for simple graphs. The theorem was published independently in 1957 by H. J. Ryser and David Gale.","image":"17d969c6569ea0543d146e726eb20b1d54178752.svg","url":"Gale–Ryser_theorem"}
