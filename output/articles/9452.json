{"title":"List of centroids","summary":"The following is a list of centroids of various two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects.  The centroid of an object X {\\displaystyle X} in n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional space is the intersection of all hyperplanes that divide X {\\displaystyle X} into two parts of equal moment about the hyperplane. Informally, it is the \"average\" of all points of X {\\displaystyle X} . For an object of uniform composition, the centroid of a body is also its center of mass. In the case of two-dimensional objects shown below, the hyperplanes are simply lines.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"List_of_centroids"}
