{"title":"Moore matrix","summary":"In linear algebra, a Moore matrix, introduced by E. H. Moore (1896), is a matrix defined over a finite field. When it is a square matrix its determinant is called a Moore determinant (this is unrelated to the Moore determinant of a quaternionic Hermitian matrix). The Moore matrix has successive powers of the Frobenius automorphism applied to its columns (beginning with the zeroth power of the Frobenius automorphism in the first column), so it is an m × n matrix","image":"8c19de249d777bb411a2ce4eb35d11be1247bb51.svg","url":"Moore_matrix"}
