{"title":"Alternative hypothesis","summary":"In statistical hypothesis testing, the alternative hypothesis is one of the proposed proposition in the hypothesis test. In general the goal of hypothesis test is to demonstrate that in the given condition, there is sufficient evidence supporting the credibility of alternative hypothesis instead of the exclusive proposition in the test  (null hypothesis).[1] It is usually consistent with the research hypothesis because it is constructed from literature review, previous studies, etc.  However, the research hypothesis is sometimes consistent with the null hypothesis.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Alternative_hypothesis"}
