{"title":"Grunwald–Wang theorem","summary":"In algebraic number theory, the Grunwald–Wang theorem is a local-global principle stating that—except in some precisely defined cases—an element x in a number field K is an nth power in K if it is an nth power in the completion K p {\\displaystyle K_{\\mathfrak {p}}} for all but finitely many primes p {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {p}}} of K. For example, a rational number is a square of a rational number if it is a square of a p-adic number for almost all primes p. The Grunwald–Wang theorem is an example of a local-global principle.","image":"42ef71423f0df0aacb0b459a435df75f029200a8.svg","url":"Grunwald–Wang_theorem"}
