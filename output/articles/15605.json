{"title":"Tetragonal crystal system","summary":"In crystallography, the tetragonal crystal system  is one of the 7 crystal systems. Tetragonal crystal lattices result from stretching a cubic lattice along one of its lattice vectors, so that the cube becomes a rectangular prism with a square base (a by a) and height (c, which is different from a).","image":"WulfeniteUSGOV.jpg.webp","url":"Tetragonal_crystal_system"}
