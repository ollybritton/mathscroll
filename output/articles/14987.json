{"title":"Stein factorization","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the Stein factorization, introduced by Karl SteinÂ (1956) for the case of complex spaces, states that a proper morphism can be factorized as a composition of a finite mapping and a proper morphism with connected fibers. Roughly speaking, Stein factorization contracts the connected  components of the fibers of a mapping to points.","image":"a21a941b35354b73f5a62849067deac7ee9794dc.svg","url":"Stein_factorization"}
