{"title":"Time hierarchy theorem","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the time hierarchy theorems are important statements about time-bounded computation on Turing machines. Informally, these theorems say that given more time, a Turing machine can solve more problems. For example, there are problems that can be solved with n2 time but not n time.","image":"96afd13867abd4f3b8fe71a3349f8d0adc946b9b.svg","url":"Time_hierarchy_theorem"}
