{"title":"Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem","summary":"This article gives a sketch of a proof of Gödel's first incompleteness theorem. This theorem applies to any formal theory that satisfies certain technical hypotheses, which are discussed as needed during the sketch. We will assume for the remainder of the article that a fixed theory satisfying these hypotheses has been selected.","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"Proof_sketch_for_Gödel's_first_incompleteness_theorem"}
