{"title":"Descent along torsors","summary":"In mathematics, given a G-torsor X â†’ Y and a stack F, the descent along torsors says there is a canonical equivalence between F(Y), the category of Y-points and F(X)G, the category of G-equivariant X-points.[1] It is a basic example of descent, since it says the \"equivariant data\" (which is an additional data) allows one to \"descend\" from X to Y.","image":"e02cf43780e318a30c49ab30287897ebeb4d33d1.svg","url":"Descent_along_torsors"}
