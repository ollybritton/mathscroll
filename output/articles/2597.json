{"title":"Chord (geometry)","summary":"A chord of a circle is a straight line segment whose endpoints both lie on a circular arc. If a chord were to be extended infinitely on both directions into a line, the object is a secant line. More generally, a chord is a line segment joining two points on any curve, for instance, an ellipse. A chord that passes through a circle's center point is the circle's diameter. The word chord is from the Latin chorda meaning bowstring.","image":"Chord_in_mathematics.svg.png.webp","url":"Chord_(geometry)"}
