{"title":"Schwarz reflection principle","summary":"In mathematics, the Schwarz reflection principle is a way to extend the domain of definition of a complex analytic function, i.e., it is a form of analytic continuation. It states that if an analytic function is defined on the upper half-plane, and has well-defined (non-singular) real values on the real axis, then it can be extended to the conjugate function on the lower half-plane. In notation, if F ( z ) {\\displaystyle F(z)} is a function that satisfies the above requirements, then its extension to the rest of the complex plane is given by the formula,","image":"5cf298d777120df944559c5e985b88a824debb80.svg","url":"Schwarz_reflection_principle"}
