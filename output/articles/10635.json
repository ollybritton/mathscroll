{"title":"Monad (category theory)","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a monad (also triple, triad, standard construction and fundamental construction)[1] is a monoid in the category of endofunctors. An endofunctor is a functor mapping a category to itself, and a monad is an endofunctor together with two natural transformations required to fulfill certain coherence conditions.  Monads are used in the theory of pairs of adjoint functors, and they generalize closure operators on partially ordered sets to arbitrary categories. Monads are also useful in the theory of datatypes, the denotational semantics of imperative programming languages, and in functional programming languages, allowing languages with non-mutable states to do things such as simulate for-loops; see Monad (functional programming).","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"Monad_(category_theory)"}
