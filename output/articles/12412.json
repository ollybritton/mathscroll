{"title":"PostBQP","summary":"In computational complexity theory, PostBQP is a complexity class consisting of all of the computational problems solvable in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine with postselection and bounded error (in the sense that the algorithm is correct at least 2/3 of the time on all inputs).","image":"48004887d8f9dfc489bd2bc793780b7f1d8039ad.svg","url":"PostBQP"}
