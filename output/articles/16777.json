{"title":"Weakly compact cardinal","summary":"In mathematics, a weakly compact cardinal is a certain kind of cardinal number introduced by Erd≈ës & Tarski (1961); weakly compact cardinals are large cardinals, meaning that their existence cannot be proven  from the standard axioms of set theory. (Tarski originally called them \"not strongly incompact\" cardinals.)","image":"0fd076fb78a7a5ee340920a3d846ddf67455f941.svg","url":"Weakly_compact_cardinal"}
