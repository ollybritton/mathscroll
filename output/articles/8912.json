{"title":"Künneth theorem","summary":"In mathematics, especially in homological algebra and algebraic topology, a Künneth theorem, also called a Künneth formula, is a statement relating the homology of two objects to the homology of their product. The classical statement of the Künneth theorem relates the singular homology of two topological spaces X and Y and their product space X × Y {\\displaystyle X\\times Y} . In the simplest possible case the relationship is that of a tensor product, but for applications it is very often necessary to apply certain tools of homological algebra to express the answer.","image":"1613c1ff4b6fbfb6c80a8da83e90ad28f0ab3483.svg","url":"Künneth_theorem"}
