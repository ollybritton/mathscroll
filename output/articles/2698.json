{"title":"Clark–Ocone theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Clark–Ocone theorem (also known as the Clark–Ocone–Haussmann theorem or formula) is a theorem of stochastic analysis. It expresses the value of some function F defined on the classical Wiener space of continuous paths starting at the origin as the sum of its mean value and an Itô integral with respect to that path. It is named after the contributions of mathematicians J.M.C. Clark (1970), Daniel Ocone (1984) and U.G. Haussmann (1978).","image":"0c382fc0985c08222913703fda156a5d0804c6f7.svg","url":"Clark–Ocone_theorem"}
