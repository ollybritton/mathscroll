{"title":"Partial likelihood methods for panel data","summary":"Partial (pooled) likelihood estimation for panel data is a quasi-maximum likelihood method for panel analysis that assumes that density of yit given xit is correctly specified for each time period but it allows for misspecification in the conditional density of yi≔(yi1,...,yiT) given xi≔(xi1,...,xiT).","image":"06fc344b8d07bc9ee3f86d8a7775fdd5e74690b0.svg","url":"Partial_likelihood_methods_for_panel_data"}
