{"title":"Fundamental theorem of Hilbert spaces","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in functional analysis and Hilbert space theory, the fundamental theorem of Hilbert spaces gives a necessarily and sufficient condition for a Hausdorff pre-Hilbert space to be a Hilbert space in terms of the canonical isometry of a pre-Hilbert space into its anti-dual.","image":"f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7.svg","url":"Fundamental_theorem_of_Hilbert_spaces"}
