{"title":"Closure (topology)","summary":"In topology, the closure of a subset S of points in a topological space consists of all points in S together with all limit points of S. The closure of S may equivalently be defined as the union of S and its boundary, and also as the intersection of all closed sets containing S. Intuitively, the closure can be thought of as all the points that are either in S or \"very near\" S. A point which is in the closure of S is a point of closure of S. The notion of closure is in many ways dual to the notion of interior.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Closure_(topology)"}
