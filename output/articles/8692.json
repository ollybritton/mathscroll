{"title":"Khinchin integral","summary":"In mathematics, the Khinchin integral (sometimes spelled Khintchine integral), also known as the Denjoyâ€“Khinchin integral, generalized Denjoy integral or wide Denjoy integral, is one of a number of definitions of the integral of a function.  It is a generalization of the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals. It is named after Aleksandr Khinchin and Arnaud Denjoy, but is not to be confused with the (narrow) Denjoy integral.","image":"3025e68d0221d0af6fa36d985a33167ca39a95ca.svg","url":"Khinchin_integral"}
