{"title":"Coframe","summary":"In mathematics, a coframe or coframe field on a smooth manifold M {\\displaystyle M} is a system of one-forms or covectors which form a basis of the cotangent bundle at every point.  In the exterior algebra of M {\\displaystyle M} , one has a natural map from v k : ⨁ k T ∗ M → ⋀ k T ∗ M {\\displaystyle v_{k}:\\bigoplus ^{k}T^{*}M\\to \\bigwedge ^{k}T^{*}M} , given by v k : ( ρ 1 , … , ρ k ) ↦ ρ 1 ∧ … ∧ ρ k {\\displaystyle v_{k}:(\\rho _{1},\\ldots ,\\rho _{k})\\mapsto \\rho _{1}\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge \\rho _{k}} .  If M {\\displaystyle M} is n {\\displaystyle n} dimensional a coframe is given by a section σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } of ⨁ n T ∗ M {\\displaystyle \\bigoplus ^{n}T^{*}M} such that v n ∘ σ ≠ 0 {\\displaystyle v_{n}\\circ \\sigma \\neq 0} .  The inverse image under v n {\\displaystyle v_{n}} of the complement of the zero section of ⋀ n T ∗ M {\\displaystyle \\bigwedge ^{n}T^{*}M} forms a G L ( n ) {\\displaystyle GL(n)} principal bundle over M {\\displaystyle M} , which is called the coframe bundle.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Coframe"}
