{"title":"Grassmann graph","summary":"In graph theory, Grassmann graphs are a special class of simple graphs defined from systems of subspaces. The vertices of the Grassmann graph Jq(n, k) are the k-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space over a finite field of order q; two vertices are adjacent when their intersection is (k â€“ 1)-dimensional.","image":"53eeb3a1e73e0f51fc7f139157df9e3116cb1beb.svg","url":"Grassmann_graph"}
