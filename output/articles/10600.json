{"title":"Modular product of graphs","summary":"In graph theory, the modular product of graphs G and H is a graph formed by combining G and H that has applications to subgraph isomorphism. It is one of several different kinds of graph products that have been studied, generally using the same vertex set (the Cartesian product of the sets of vertices of the two graphs G and H) but with different rules for determining which edges to include.","image":"Modular_product.png.webp","url":"Modular_product_of_graphs"}
