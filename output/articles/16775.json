{"title":"Weak trace-class operator","summary":"In mathematics, a weak trace class operator  is a compact operator on a separable Hilbert space H with singular values the same order as the harmonic sequence. When the dimension of H is infinite, the ideal of weak trace-class operators is strictly larger than the ideal of trace class operators, and has fundamentally different properties. The usual operator trace on the trace-class operators does not extend to the weak trace class. Instead the ideal of weak trace-class operators admits an infinite number of linearly independent quasi-continuous traces, and it is the smallest two-sided ideal for which all traces on it are singular traces.","image":"ca56b8237507d3800340e56c1a5c9a668e115cef.svg","url":"Weak_trace-class_operator"}
