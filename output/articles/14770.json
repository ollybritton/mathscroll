{"title":"Sphere","summary":"A sphere (from Ancient Greek  σφαῖρα (sphaîra) 'globe, ball')[1] is a geometrical object that is a three-dimensional analogue to a two-dimensional circle. A sphere is the set of points that are all at the same distance r from a given point in three-dimensional space.[2] That given point is the centre of the sphere, and r is the sphere's radius. The earliest known mentions of spheres appear in the work of the ancient Greek mathematicians.","image":"Sphere_wireframe_10deg_6r.svg.png.webp","url":"Sphere"}
