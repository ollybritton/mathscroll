{"title":"Thomas Kirkman","summary":"Thomas Penyngton Kirkman FRS (31 March 1806 â€“ 3 February 1895) was a British mathematician and ordained minister of the Church of England. Despite being primarily a churchman, he maintained an active interest in research-level mathematics, and was listed by Alexander Macfarlane as one of ten leading 19th-century British mathematicians.[1][2][3] In the 1840s, he obtained an existence theorem for Steiner triple systems that founded the field of combinatorial design theory, while the related Kirkman's schoolgirl problem is named after him.[4][5]","image":"Thomas_P_Kirkman.jpg.webp","url":"Thomas_Kirkman"}
