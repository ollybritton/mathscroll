{"title":"Thompson groups","summary":"In mathematics, the Thompson groups (also called Thompson's groups, vagabond groups or chameleon groups) are three groups, commonly denoted F ⊆ T ⊆ V {\\displaystyle F\\subseteq T\\subseteq V} , that were introduced by Richard Thompson in some unpublished handwritten notes in 1965 as a possible counterexample to the von Neumann conjecture. Of the three, F is the most widely studied, and is sometimes referred to as the Thompson group or Thompson's group.","image":"185bf869f109bf202e6696c077cd9c200fd5a7e4.svg","url":"Thompson_groups"}
