{"title":"Twist (mathematics)","summary":"In differential geometry, the twist of a ribbon is its rate of axial rotation. Let a ribbon ( X , U ) {\\displaystyle (X,U)} be composted of space curve X = X ( s ) {\\displaystyle X=X(s)} , where s {\\displaystyle s} is the arc length of X {\\displaystyle X} , and U = U ( s ) {\\displaystyle U=U(s)} the a unit normal vector, perpendicular at each point to X {\\displaystyle X} . Since the ribbon ( X , U ) {\\displaystyle (X,U)} has edges X {\\displaystyle X} and X ′ = X + ε U {\\displaystyle X'=X+\\varepsilon U} , the twist (or total twist number) T w {\\displaystyle Tw} measures the average winding of the edge curve X ′ {\\displaystyle X'} around and along the axial curve X {\\displaystyle X} . According to Love (1944) twist is defined by","image":"5b12bcfdb2fa7465cf7e059ba8cb9f165793c7bc.svg","url":"Twist_(mathematics)"}
