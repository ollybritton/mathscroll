{"title":"Fractal canopy","summary":"In geometry, a fractal canopy, a type of fractal tree, is one of the easiest-to-create types of fractals. Each canopy  is created by splitting a line segment into two smaller segments at the end (symmetric binary tree), and then splitting the two smaller segments as well, and so on, infinitely.[1][2][3] Canopies are distinguished by the angle between concurrent adjacent segments and ratio between lengths of successive segments.","image":"Fractal_canopy.svg.png.webp","url":"Fractal_canopy"}
