{"title":"Abel's test","summary":"In mathematics, Abel's test (also known as Abel's criterion) is a method of testing for the convergence of an infinite series. The test is named after mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. There are two slightly different versions of Abel's test â€“ one is used with series of real numbers, and the other is used with power series in complex analysis. Abel's uniform convergence test is a criterion for the uniform convergence of a series of functions dependent on parameters.","image":"2993f473f311220169d2c33a446013bc8d6ca2d7.svg","url":"Abel's_test"}
