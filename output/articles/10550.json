{"title":"Mixed Hodge module","summary":"In mathematics, mixed Hodge modules are the culmination of Hodge theory, mixed Hodge structures, intersection cohomology, and the decomposition theorem yielding a coherent framework for discussing variations of degenerating mixed Hodge structures through the six functor formalism. Essentially, these objects are a pair of a filtered D-module ( M , F ∙ ) {\\displaystyle (M,F^{\\bullet })} together with a perverse sheaf F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} such that the functor from the Riemann–Hilbert correspondence sends ( M , F ∙ ) {\\displaystyle (M,F^{\\bullet })} to F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} . This makes it possible to construct a Hodge structure on intersection cohomology, one of the key problems when the subject was discovered. This was solved by Morihiko Saito who found a way to use the filtration on a coherent D-module as an analogue of the Hodge filtration for a Hodge structure.[1] This made it possible to give a Hodge structure on an intersection cohomology sheaf, the simple objects in the Abelian category of perverse sheaves.","image":"756d6ae95050b20e952b03fbd9572771a4920f64.svg","url":"Mixed_Hodge_module"}
