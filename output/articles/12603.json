{"title":"Projectionless C*-algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a  projectionless C*-algebra is a C*-algebra with no nontrivial projections. For a unital C*-algebra, the projections 0 and 1 are trivial. While for a non-unital C*-algebra, only 0 is considered trivial. The problem of whether simple infinite-dimensional C*-algebras with this property exist was posed in 1958 by Irving Kaplansky,[1] and the first example of one was published in 1981 by Bruce Blackadar.[1][2] For commutative C*-algebras, being projectionless is equivalent to its spectrum being connected. Due to this, being projectionless can be considered as a noncommutative analogue of a connected space.","image":"8fb66d859a02774bab6a6ad7231a54b3648b62d4.svg","url":"Projectionless_C*-algebra"}
