{"title":"Local Langlands conjectures","summary":"In mathematics, the local Langlands conjectures, introduced by Robert LanglandsÂ (1967, 1970),  are part of the Langlands program. They describe a correspondence between the complex representations of a reductive algebraic group G over a local field F, and representations of the Langlands group of F into the L-group of G. This correspondence is not a bijection in general. The conjectures can be thought of as a generalization of local class field theory from abelian Galois groups to non-abelian Galois groups.","image":"fc413e0c6483c4923b796846b98ef2e3bbdb8efa.svg","url":"Local_Langlands_conjectures"}
