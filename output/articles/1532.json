{"title":"Beta-model","summary":"In model theory, a mathematical discipline, a β-model (from the French \"bon ordre\", well-ordering[1]) is a model which is correct about statements of the form \"X is well-ordered\". The term was introduced by Mostowski (1959)[2][3] as a strengthening of the notion of ω-model. In contrast to the notation for set-theoretic properties named by ordinals, such as ξ {\\displaystyle \\xi } -indescribability, the letter β here is only denotational.","image":"e0b461aaf61091abd5d2c808931c48b8ff9647db.svg","url":"Beta-model"}
