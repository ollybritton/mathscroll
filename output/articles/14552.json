{"title":"Small hexagrammic hexecontahedron","summary":"In geometry, the small hexagrammic hexecontahedron is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron. It is the dual of the small retrosnub icosicosidodecahedron. It is partially degenerate, having coincident vertices, as its dual has coplanar triangular faces.","image":"DU72_small_hexagrammic_hexecontahedron.png.webp","url":"Small_hexagrammic_hexecontahedron"}
