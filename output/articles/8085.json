{"title":"Isotropic measure","summary":"In probability theory, an isotropic measure is any mathematical measure that is invariant under linear isometries. It is a standard simplification and assumption used in probability theory. Generally, it is used in the context of measure theory on n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space, for which it can be intuitive to study measures that are unchanged by rotations and translations. An obvious example of such a measure is the standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space: Lebesgue measure.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Isotropic_measure"}
