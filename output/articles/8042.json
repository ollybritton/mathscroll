{"title":"Isaac Barrow","summary":"Isaac Barrow (October 1630 â€“ 4 May 1677) was an English Christian theologian and mathematician who is generally given credit for his early role in the development of infinitesimal calculus; in particular, for proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus.[3] His work centered on the properties of the tangent; Barrow was the first to calculate the tangents of the kappa curve. He is also notable for being the inaugural holder of the prestigious Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics, a post later held by his student, Isaac Newton.","image":"Isaac_Barrow_by_Mary_Beale.jpg.webp","url":"Isaac_Barrow"}
