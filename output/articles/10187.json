{"title":"Max-flow min-cut theorem","summary":"In computer science and optimization theory, the max-flow min-cut theorem states that in a flow network, the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the sink is equal to the total weight of the edges in a minimum cut, i.e., the smallest total weight of the edges which if removed would disconnect the source from the sink.","image":"3c6e166a33f7f6adfefa2eeec2fac3ba4ecfb92a.svg","url":"Max-flow_min-cut_theorem"}
