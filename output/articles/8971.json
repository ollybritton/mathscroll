{"title":"Laman graph","summary":"In graph theory, the Laman graphs are a family of sparse graphs describing the minimally rigid systems of rods and joints in the plane. Formally, a Laman graph is a graph on n vertices such that, for all k, every k-vertex subgraph has at most 2k − 3 edges, and such that the whole graph has exactly 2n − 3 edges. Laman graphs are named after Gerard Laman, of the University of Amsterdam, who in 1970 used them to characterize rigid planar structures.[1] This characterization, however, had already been discovered in 1927 by Hilda Geiringer.[2]","image":"Moser_spindle_pseudotriangulation.svg.png.webp","url":"Laman_graph"}
