{"title":"Bricard octahedron","summary":"In geometry, a Bricard octahedron is a member of a family of flexible polyhedra constructed by Raoul Bricard in 1897.[1] The overall shape of one of these polyhedron may change in a continuous motion, without any changes to the lengths of its edges nor to the shapes of its faces.[2] These octahedra were the first flexible polyhedra to be discovered.[3]","image":"Br1-anim.gif","url":"Bricard_octahedron"}
