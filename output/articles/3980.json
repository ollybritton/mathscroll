{"title":"Derivation (differential algebra)","summary":"In mathematics, a derivation is a function on an algebra which generalizes certain features of the derivative operator.  Specifically, given an algebra A over a ring or a field K, a K-derivation is a K-linear map D : A → A that satisfies Leibniz's law:","image":"b99eaa00ab0300206e8930c1467d332cc16cfb75.svg","url":"Derivation_(differential_algebra)"}
