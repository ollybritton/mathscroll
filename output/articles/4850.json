{"title":"Enriques surface","summary":"In mathematics,  Enriques surfaces are algebraic surfaces such that the irregularity q = 0 and  the canonical line bundle K is non-trivial but has trivial square. Enriques surfaces are all projective (and therefore Kähler over the complex numbers) and are elliptic surfaces of genus 0. Over fields of characteristic not 2 they are quotients of K3 surfaces by a group of order 2 acting without fixed points and their theory is similar to that of algebraic K3 surfaces. Enriques surfaces were first studied in detail by Enriques (1896) as an answer to a question discussed by Castelnuovo (1895) about whether a surface with q = pg = 0 is necessarily rational, though some of the Reye congruences introduced earlier by Reye (1882) are also examples of Enriques surfaces.","image":"e60643e508f9e3844b3bb95d55ef1c84ff711afe.svg","url":"Enriques_surface"}
