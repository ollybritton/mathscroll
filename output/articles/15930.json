{"title":"Toy problem","summary":"In scientific disciplines, a toy problem[1][2] or a puzzlelike problem[3] is a problem that is not of immediate scientific interest, yet is used as an expository device to illustrate a trait that may be shared by other, more complicated, instances of the problem, or as a way to explain a particular, more general, problem solving technique. A toy problem is useful to test and demonstrate methodologies. Researchers can use toy problems to compare the performance of different algorithms. They are also good for game designing.","image":"lossless-page1-220px-Vacuum_World.tif.png.webp","url":"Toy_problem"}
