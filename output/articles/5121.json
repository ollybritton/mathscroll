{"title":"Exact couple","summary":"In mathematics, an exact couple, due to William S. MasseyÂ (1952), is a general source of spectral sequences. It is common especially in algebraic topology; for example, Serre spectral sequence can be constructed by first constructing an exact couple.","image":"449494a083e0a1fda2b61c62b2f09b6bee4633dc.svg","url":"Exact_couple"}
