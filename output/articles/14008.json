{"title":"Schwarzian derivative","summary":"In mathematics, the Schwarzian derivative is an operator similar to the derivative which is invariant under Möbius transformations. Thus, it occurs in the theory of the complex projective line, and in particular, in the theory of modular forms and hypergeometric functions. It plays an important role in the theory of univalent functions, conformal mapping and Teichmüller spaces. It is named after the German mathematician Hermann Schwarz.","image":"c60a64543c6069baf508d18b856e27b64e6deac6.svg","url":"Schwarzian_derivative"}
