{"title":"AF+BG theorem","summary":"In algebraic geometry the AF+BG theorem (also known as Max Noether's fundamental theorem) is a result of Max Noether that asserts that, if  the equation of an algebraic curve in the complex projective plane belongs locally (at each intersection point) to the ideal generated by the equations of two other algebraic curves, then it belongs globally to this ideal.","image":"02e892a2d48ff09d2f95b0e8b8eb419d42e179c6.svg","url":"AF+BG_theorem"}
