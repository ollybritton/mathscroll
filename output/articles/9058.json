{"title":"Lattice Boltzmann methods for solids","summary":"The Lattice Boltzmann methods for solids (LBMS) are a set of methods for solving partial differential equations (PDE) in solid mechanics. The methods use a discretization of the Boltzmann equation(BM), and their use is known as the lattice Boltzmann methods for solids.","image":"d4cf3ca62fd48ea2a2e9701ecc95986461ee1e7d.svg","url":"Lattice_Boltzmann_methods_for_solids"}
