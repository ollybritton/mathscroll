{"title":"Fiber bundle construction theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the fiber bundle construction theorem is a theorem which constructs a fiber bundle from a given base space, fiber and a suitable set of transition functions. The theorem also gives conditions under which two such bundles are isomorphic. The theorem is important in the associated bundle construction where one starts with a given bundle and surgically replaces the fiber with a new space while keeping all other data the same.","image":"Mobius_transition_functions.png.webp","url":"Fiber_bundle_construction_theorem"}
