{"title":"Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture (often called the Birchâ€“Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture) describes the set of rational solutions to equations defining an elliptic curve. It is an open problem in the field of number theory and is widely recognized as one of the most challenging mathematical problems. It is named after mathematicians Bryan John Birch and Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, who developed the conjecture during the first half of the 1960s with the help of machine computation. As of 2022, only special cases of the conjecture have been proven.","image":"942cfe0a7d3eb44efca16de846bf62ef060f211e.svg","url":"Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture"}
