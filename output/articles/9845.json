{"title":"Madhava of Sangamagrama","summary":"Mādhava of Sangamagrāma (Mādhavan)[5] (c. 1340 – c. 1425) was an Indian mathematician and astronomer who is considered as the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. One of the greatest mathematician-astronomers of the Middle Ages, Madhava made pioneering contributions to the study of infinite series, calculus, trigonometry, geometry, and algebra. He was the first to use infinite series approximations for a range of trigonometric functions, which has been called the \"decisive step onward from the finite procedures of ancient mathematics to treat their limit-passage to infinity\".[1]","image":"Yuktibhasa.svg.png.webp","url":"Madhava_of_Sangamagrama"}
