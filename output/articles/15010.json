{"title":"Stellated rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb","summary":"The stellated rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 3-space made up of copies of stellated rhombic dodecahedron cells.[1] Six stellated rhombic dodecahedra meet at each vertex. This honeycomb is cell-transitive, edge-transitive and vertex-transitive.","image":"HC_R1-1stellation.png.webp","url":"Stellated_rhombic_dodecahedral_honeycomb"}
