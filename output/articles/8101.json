{"title":"Iterated forcing","summary":"In mathematics, iterated forcing is a method for constructing models of set theory by repeating Cohen's forcing method a transfinite number of times. Iterated forcing was introduced by Solovay and TennenbaumÂ (1971) in their construction of a model of set theory with no Suslin tree. They also showed that iterated forcing can construct models where Martin's axiom holds and the continuum is any given regular cardinal.","image":"e20e29ac56d6cc52eaeb2f9c0bf79ef706428ddf.svg","url":"Iterated_forcing"}
