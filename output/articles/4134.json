{"title":"Dimension function","summary":"In mathematics, the notion of an (exact) dimension function (also known as a gauge function) is a tool in the study of fractals and other subsets of metric spaces. Dimension functions are a generalisation of the simple \"diameter to the dimension\" power law used in the construction of s-dimensional Hausdorff measure.","image":"21037dfc52103fb88dc1c77b4ceb7ed152c97632.svg","url":"Dimension_function"}
