{"title":"Uniformization (probability theory)","summary":"In probability theory, uniformization method, (also known as Jensen's method[1] or the randomization method[2]) is a method to compute transient solutions of finite state continuous-time Markov chains, by approximating the process by a discrete-time Markov chain.[2] The original chain is scaled by the fastest transition rate Î³, so that transitions occur at the same rate in every state, hence the name. The method is simple to program and efficiently calculates an approximation to the transient distribution at a single point in time (near zero).[1] The method was first introduced by Winfried Grassmann in 1977.[3][4][5]","image":"f34229fc7e5a01d8c62ba6c99007c3fb719763c9.svg","url":"Uniformization_(probability_theory)"}
