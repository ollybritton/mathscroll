{"title":"Equidissection","summary":"In geometry, an equidissection is a partition of a polygon into triangles of equal area.  The study of equidissections began in the late 1960s with Monsky's theorem, which states that a square cannot be equidissected into an odd number of triangles.[1] In fact, most polygons cannot be equidissected at all.[2]","image":"Square_dissected_into_6_equal_area_triangles_no_border.svg.png.webp","url":"Equidissection"}
