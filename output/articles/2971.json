{"title":"Complete Heyting algebra","summary":"In mathematics, especially in order theory, a complete Heyting algebra is a Heyting algebra that is complete as a lattice. Complete Heyting algebras are the objects of three different categories; the category CHey, the category Loc of locales, and its opposite, the category Frm of frames. Although these three categories contain the same  objects, they differ in their morphisms, and thus get distinct names. Only the morphisms of CHey are homomorphisms of complete Heyting algebras.","image":"d14ecfffd80555c72aa07a3565d7aaca4cd66df0.svg","url":"Complete_Heyting_algebra"}
