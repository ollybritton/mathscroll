{"title":"Ordered algebra","summary":"In mathematics, an ordered algebra is an algebra over the real numbers R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } with unit e together with an associated order such that e is positive (i.e. e â‰¥ 0), the product of any two positive elements is again positive, and when A is considered as a vector space over R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } then it is an Archimedean ordered vector space.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Ordered_algebra"}
