{"title":"Fluctuation loss","summary":"Fluctuation loss is an effect seen in radar systems as the target object moves or changes its orientation relative to the radar system. It was extensively studied during the 1950s by Peter Swerling, who introduced the Swerling models to allow the effect to be simulated. For this reason, it is sometimes known as Swerling loss or similar names.","image":"50f1f4e63701bbc0aa8975f23f99ed0e91b74546.svg","url":"Fluctuation_loss"}
