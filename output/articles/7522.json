{"title":"Hypergeometric function","summary":"In mathematics, the Gaussian or ordinary hypergeometric function 2F1(a,b;c;z) is a special function represented by the hypergeometric series, that includes many other special functions as specific or limiting cases. It is a solution of a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). Every second-order linear ODE with three regular singular points can be transformed into this equation.","image":"Plot_of_the_hypergeometric_function_2F1(a%2Cb%3B_c%3B_z)_with_a%3D2_and_b%3D3_and_c%3D4_in_the_complex_plane_from_-2-2i_to_2%2B2i_with_colors_created_with_Mathematica_13.1_function_ComplexPlot3D.svg.png.webp","url":"Hypergeometric_function"}
