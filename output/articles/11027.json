{"title":"Nevanlinna function","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of complex analysis, a Nevanlinna function  is a complex function which is an analytic function on the open upper half-plane H {\\displaystyle \\,{\\mathcal {H}}\\,} and has non-negative imaginary part. A Nevanlinna function maps the upper half-plane to itself or to a real constant,[1] but is not necessarily injective or surjective. Functions with this property are sometimes also known as Herglotz, Pick or R functions.","image":"ddeefd53b1dc8af26396585586b70fb4ca2c53bb.svg","url":"Nevanlinna_function"}
