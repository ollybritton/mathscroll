{"title":"Asymmetric numeral systems","summary":"Asymmetric numeral systems (ANS)[1][2] is a family of entropy encoding methods introduced by Jaros≈Çaw (Jarek) Duda[3] from Jagiellonian University, used in data compression since 2014[4] due to improved performance compared to previous methods.[5] ANS combines the compression ratio of arithmetic coding (which uses a nearly accurate probability distribution), with a processing cost similar to that of Huffman coding. In the tabled ANS (tANS) variant, this is achieved by constructing a finite-state machine to operate on a large alphabet without using multiplication.","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Asymmetric_numeral_systems"}
