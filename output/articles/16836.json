{"title":"Well-covered graph","summary":"In graph theory, a well-covered graph is an undirected graph in which every minimal vertex cover has the same size as every other minimal vertex cover. Equivalently, these are the graphs in which all maximal independent sets have equal size. Well-covered graphs were defined and first studied by Michael D. Plummer in 1970.","image":"Well-covered_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Well-covered_graph"}
