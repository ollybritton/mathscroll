{"title":"Versor","summary":"In mathematics, a versor is a quaternion of norm one (a unit quaternion). The word is derived from Latin versare = \"to turn\" with the suffix -or forming a noun from the verb (i.e. versor = \"the turner\"). It was introduced by William Rowan Hamilton in the context of his quaternion theory.","image":"4c704e6db7d06ea5566ffe6f593db4819fb0444a.svg","url":"Versor"}
