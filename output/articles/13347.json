{"title":"Reidemeister move","summary":"In the mathematical area of knot theory, a Reidemeister move is any of three local moves on a link diagram.  Kurt Reidemeister (1927) and, independently, James Waddell Alexander and Garland Baird Briggs (1926), demonstrated that two knot diagrams belonging to the same knot, up to planar isotopy, can be related by a sequence of the three Reidemeister moves.","image":"Reidemeister_move_1.svg.png.webp","url":"Reidemeister_move"}
