{"title":"Adjunction space","summary":"In mathematics, an adjunction space (or attaching space) is a common construction in topology where one topological space is attached or \"glued\" onto another. Specifically, let X and Y be topological spaces, and let A be a subspace of Y. Let f : A → X be a continuous map (called the attaching map). One forms the adjunction space X ∪f Y (sometimes also written as X +f Y) by taking the disjoint union of X and Y and identifying a with f(a) for all a in A.
