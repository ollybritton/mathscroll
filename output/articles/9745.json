{"title":"Lubin–Tate formal group law","summary":"In mathematics, the Lubin–Tate formal group law is a formal group law introduced by Lubin and  Tate (1965) to isolate the local field part of the classical theory of complex multiplication of elliptic functions. In particular it can be used to construct the totally ramified abelian extensions of a local field. It does this by considering the (formal) endomorphisms of the formal group, emulating the way in which elliptic curves with extra endomorphisms are used to give abelian extensions of global fields.","image":"40ad281354dc0ec5e7e6713b5bd841b3959d354f.svg","url":"Lubin–Tate_formal_group_law"}
