{"title":"Robbins' theorem","summary":"In graph theory, Robbins' theorem, named after Herbert RobbinsÂ (1939), states that the graphs that have strong orientations are exactly the 2-edge-connected graphs. That is, it is possible to choose a direction for each edge of an undirected graph G, turning it into a directed graph that has a path from every vertex to every other vertex, if and only if G is connected and has no bridge.","image":"Ear_decomposition.png.webp","url":"Robbins'_theorem"}
