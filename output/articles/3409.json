{"title":"Conway circle theorem","summary":"In plane geometry, the Conway circle theorem states that when the sides meeting at each vertex of a triangle are extended by the length of the opposite side, the six endpoints of the three resulting line segments lie on a circle whose centre is the incentre of the triangle. The circle on which these six points lie is called the Conway circle of the triangle.[1][2][3]  The theorem and circle are named after mathematician John Horton Conway.","image":"Conway_circle_and_incircle.svg.png.webp","url":"Conway_circle_theorem"}
