{"title":"Axiom of determinacy","summary":"In mathematics, the axiom of determinacy (abbreviated as AD) is a possible axiom for set theory introduced by Jan Mycielski and Hugo Steinhaus in 1962.  It refers to certain two-person topological games of length Ï‰. AD states that every game of a certain type is determined; that is, one of the two players has a winning strategy.","image":"721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1.svg","url":"Axiom_of_determinacy"}
