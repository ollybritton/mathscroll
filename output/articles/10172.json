{"title":"Matroid polytope","summary":"In mathematics, a matroid polytope, also called a matroid basis polytope (or basis matroid polytope) to distinguish it from other polytopes derived from a matroid, is a polytope constructed via the bases of a matroid. Given a matroid M {\\displaystyle M} , the matroid polytope P M {\\displaystyle P_{M}} is the convex hull of the indicator vectors of the bases of M {\\displaystyle M} .","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Matroid_polytope"}
