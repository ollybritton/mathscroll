{"title":"Fredholm alternative","summary":"In mathematics, the Fredholm alternative, named after Ivar Fredholm, is one of Fredholm's theorems and is a result in Fredholm theory. It may be expressed in several ways, as a theorem of linear algebra, a theorem of integral equations, or as a theorem on Fredholm operators. Part of the result states that a non-zero complex number in the spectrum of a compact operator is an eigenvalue.","image":"f0fabb548ced097e03f45cf54dbb066d23d010f3.svg","url":"Fredholm_alternative"}
