{"title":"Tarski's exponential function problem","summary":"In model theory, Tarski's exponential function problem asks whether the theory of the real numbers together with the exponential function is decidable. Alfred Tarski had previously shown that the theory of the real numbers (without the exponential function) is decidable.","image":"8822272dee2891eeba37f4e5ebb37880c8a39d99.svg","url":"Tarski's_exponential_function_problem"}
