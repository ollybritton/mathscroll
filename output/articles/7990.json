{"title":"Inverse depth parametrization","summary":"In computer vision, the inverse depth parametrization is a parametrization used in methods for 3D reconstruction from multiple images such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).[1][2] Given a point p {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {p} } in 3D space observed by a monocular pinhole camera from multiple views, the inverse depth parametrization of the point's position is a 6D vector that encodes the optical centre of the camera c 0 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {c} _{0}} when in first observed the point, and the position of the point along the ray passing through p {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {p} } and c 0 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {c} _{0}} .[3]","image":"dd73e3862cb92b016721b8c492eadb4e8a577527.svg","url":"Inverse_depth_parametrization"}
