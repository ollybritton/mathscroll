{"title":"Perfect matching","summary":"In graph theory, a perfect matching in a graph is a matching that covers every vertex of the graph. More formally, given a graph G = (V, E), a perfect matching in G is a subset M of edge set E, such that every vertex in the vertex set V is adjacent to exactly one edge in M.","image":"Maximum-matching-labels.svg.png.webp","url":"Perfect_matching"}
