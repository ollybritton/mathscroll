{"title":"Geometric graph theory","summary":"Geometric graph theory in the broader sense is a large and amorphous subfield of graph theory, concerned with graphs defined by geometric means. In a stricter sense, geometric graph theory studies combinatorial and geometric properties of geometric graphs, meaning graphs drawn in the Euclidean plane with possibly intersecting straight-line edges, and topological graphs, where the edges are allowed to be arbitrary continuous curves connecting the vertices, thus it is \"the theory of geometric and topological graphs\" (Pach 2013). Geometric graphs are also known as spatial networks.","image":"Internet_map_1024.jpg.webp","url":"Geometric_graph_theory"}
