{"title":"Confidence interval","summary":"In frequentist statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a range of estimates for an unknown parameter. A confidence interval is computed at a designated confidence level; the 95% confidence level is most common, but other levels, such as 90% or 99%, are sometimes used.[1][2] The confidence level represents the long-run proportion of CIs (at the given confidence level) that theoretically contain the true value of the parameter. For example, out of all intervals computed at the 95% level, 95% of them should contain the parameter's true value.[3]","image":"Normal_distribution_50%_CI_illustration.svg.png.webp","url":"Confidence_interval"}
