{"title":"BQP","summary":"In computational complexity theory, bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) is the class of decision problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time, with an error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances.[1] It is the quantum analogue to the complexity class BPP.","image":"Randomised_Complexity_Classes_2.svg.png.webp","url":"BQP"}
