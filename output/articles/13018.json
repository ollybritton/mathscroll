{"title":"Rademacher's theorem","summary":"In mathematical analysis, Rademacher's theorem, named after Hans Rademacher, states the following: If U is an open subset of Rn and f: U â†’ Rm is Lipschitz continuous, then f is differentiable almost everywhere in U; that is, the points in U at which f is not differentiable form a set of Lebesgue measure zero. Differentiability here refers to infinitesimal approximability by a linear map, which in particular asserts the existence of the coordinate-wise partial derivatives.","image":"e6aae3d15061d22327d2e6468ac08e253b27d1a8.svg","url":"Rademacher's_theorem"}
