{"title":"Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem bounds the order of the group of automorphisms, via orientation-preserving conformal mappings, of a compact Riemann surface of genus g > 1, stating that the number of such automorphisms cannot exceed 84(g − 1). A group for which the maximum is achieved is called a Hurwitz group, and the corresponding Riemann surface a Hurwitz surface. Because compact Riemann surfaces are synonymous with non-singular complex projective algebraic curves, a Hurwitz surface can also be called a Hurwitz curve.[1] The theorem is named after Adolf Hurwitz, who proved it in (Hurwitz 1893).","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Hurwitz's_automorphisms_theorem"}
