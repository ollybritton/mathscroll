{"title":"Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev model","summary":"In condensed matter physics and black hole physics, the Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model is an exactly solvable model initially proposed by Subir Sachdev and Jinwu Ye,[1] and later modified by Alexei Kitaev to the present commonly used form.[2][3] The model is believed to bring insights into the understanding of strongly correlated materials and it also has a close relation with the discrete model of AdS/CFT. Many condensed matter systems, such as quantum dot coupled to topological superconducting wires,[4] graphene flake with irregular boundary,[5] and kagome optical lattice with impurities,[6] are proposed to be modeled by it. Some variants of the model are amenable to digital quantum simulation,[7] with pioneering experiments implemented in a NMR setting.[8]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev_model"}
