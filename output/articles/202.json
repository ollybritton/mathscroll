{"title":"AC (complexity)","summary":"In circuit complexity, AC is a complexity class hierarchy.  Each class, ACi, consists of the languages recognized by Boolean circuits with depth O ( log i ‚Å° n ) {\\displaystyle O(\\log ^{i}n)} and a polynomial number of unlimited fan-in AND and OR gates.","image":"9b41dfe02f58891baac93b13d91bd92102222bbc.svg","url":"AC_(complexity)"}
