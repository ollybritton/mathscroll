{"title":"Celsius","summary":"The degree Celsius is the unit of temperature on the Celsius scale[1] (originally known as the centigrade scale outside Sweden),[2] one of two temperature scales used in the International System of Units (SI), the other being the Kelvin scale. The degree Celsius (symbol: °C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale or a unit to indicate a difference or range between two temperatures. It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), who developed a variant of it in 1742. Before being renamed in 1948 to honour Celsius, the unit was called centigrade, from the Latin centum, which means 100, and gradus, which means steps. Most countries use this scale; the other major scale, Fahrenheit, is still used in the United States, some island territories, and Liberia. The Kelvin scale is of use in the sciences, with 0 K (−273.15 °C) representing absolute zero.","image":"Pakkanen.jpg.webp","url":"Celsius"}
