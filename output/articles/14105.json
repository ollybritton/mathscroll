{"title":"Semi-infinite programming","summary":"In optimization theory, semi-infinite programming (SIP) is an optimization problem with a finite number of variables and an infinite number of constraints, or an infinite number of variables and a finite number of constraints. In the former case the constraints are typically parameterized.[1]","image":"0cbb55f15ad6c08ba0a788ffa6803ccf5edb49be.svg","url":"Semi-infinite_programming"}
