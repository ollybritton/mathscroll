{"title":"Gauss's lemma (number theory)","summary":"Gauss's lemma in number theory gives a condition for an integer to be a quadratic residue. Although it is not useful computationally, it has theoretical significance, being involved in some proofs of quadratic reciprocity.","image":"82941c63fd5e49cf0b57612ee5e895d1e1c9096c.svg","url":"Gauss's_lemma_(number_theory)"}
