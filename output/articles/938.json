{"title":"Arc diagram","summary":"An arc diagram is a style of graph drawing, in which the vertices of a graph are placed along a line in the Euclidean plane, with edges being drawn as semicircles in one or both of the two halfplanes bounded by the line, or as smooth curves formed by sequences of semicircles. In some cases, line segments of the line itself are also allowed as edges, as long as they connect only vertices that are consecutive along the line. Variations of this drawing style in which the semicircles are replaced by convex curves of some other type are also commonly called arc diagrams.[1]","image":"Goldner-Harary-linear.svg.png.webp","url":"Arc_diagram"}
