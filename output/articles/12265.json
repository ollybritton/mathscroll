{"title":"Pointwise product","summary":"In mathematics, the pointwise product of two functions is another function, obtained by multiplying the images of the two functions at each value in the domain. If f and g are both functions with domain X and codomain Y, and elements of Y can be multiplied (for instance, Y could be some set of numbers), then the pointwise product of f and g is another function from X to Y which maps x in X to f (x)g(x) in Y.","image":"f8455d9b1d33815bc1394cac7fffdb94f6dd4fc8.svg","url":"Pointwise_product"}
