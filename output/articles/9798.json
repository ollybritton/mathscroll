{"title":"Lévy flight","summary":"A Lévy flight is a random walk in which the step-lengths have a stable distribution,[1] a probability distribution that is heavy-tailed. When defined as a walk in a space of dimension greater than one, the steps made are in isotropic random directions. Later researchers have extended the use of the term \"Lévy flight\" to also include cases where the random walk takes place on a discrete grid rather than on a continuous space.[2]","image":"a1754e4d21ddcb44e8f18cf67365d4b8fadf299d.svg","url":"Lévy_flight"}
