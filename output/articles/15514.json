{"title":"Tarski's theorem about choice","summary":"In mathematics, Tarski's theorem, proved by Alfred Tarski (1924), states that in ZF the theorem \"For every infinite set A {\\displaystyle A} , there is a bijective map between the sets A {\\displaystyle A} and A × A {\\displaystyle A\\times A} \" implies the axiom of choice. The opposite direction was already known, thus the theorem and axiom of choice are equivalent.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Tarski's_theorem_about_choice"}
