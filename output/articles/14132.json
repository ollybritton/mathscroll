{"title":"Seminormal ring","summary":"In algebra, a seminormal ring is a commutative reduced ring in which, whenever x, y satisfy x 3 = y 2 {\\displaystyle x^{3}=y^{2}} , there is s with s 2 = x {\\displaystyle s^{2}=x} and s 3 = y {\\displaystyle s^{3}=y} . This definition was given by Swan (1980) as a simplification of the original definition of Traverso (1970).","image":"584536320b134ab6dd25a40e6c518b939e9d2fdd.svg","url":"Seminormal_ring"}
