{"title":"Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm","summary":"In mathematics (linear algebra), the Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm is a recursive method to calculate the coefficients of the  characteristic polynomial p A ( λ ) = det ( λ I n − A ) {\\displaystyle p_{A}(\\lambda )=\\det(\\lambda I_{n}-A)} of a  square matrix, A, named after  Dmitry Konstantinovich Faddeev and Urbain Le Verrier. Calculation of this polynomial yields the  eigenvalues  of A as its roots; as a matrix polynomial in  the matrix A itself, it vanishes by the fundamental Cayley–Hamilton theorem. Computing determinant from the definition of characteristic polynomial, however, is computationally cumbersome, because λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } is new symbolic quantity, whereas this algorithm works directly with coefficients of matrix A {\\displaystyle A} .","image":"e22adec842ec1056cba3d689e58d4b842dc55278.svg","url":"Faddeev–LeVerrier_algorithm"}
