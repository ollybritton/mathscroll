{"title":"Incidence (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, an incidence relation is a heterogeneous relation that captures the idea being expressed when phrases such as \"a point lies on a line\" or \"a line is contained in a plane\" are used. The most basic incidence relation is that between a point, P, and a line, l, sometimes denoted P I l. If P I l the pair (P, l) is called a flag. There are many expressions used in common language to describe incidence (for example, a line passes through a point, a point lies in a plane, etc.) but the term \"incidence\" is preferred because it does not have the additional connotations that these other terms have, and it can be used in a symmetric manner. Statements such as \"line l1 intersects line l2\" are also statements about incidence relations, but in this case, it is because this is a shorthand way of saying that \"there exists a point P that is incident with both line l1 and line l2\". When one type of object can be thought of as a set of the other type of object (viz., a plane is a set of points) then an incidence relation may be viewed as containment.","image":"16ff9a189d496eefa14712c08c6a18fdd51e11de.svg","url":"Incidence_(geometry)"}
