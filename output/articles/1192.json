{"title":"Axiom of dependent choice","summary":"In mathematics, the axiom of dependent choice, denoted by D C {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {DC}}} , is a weak form of the axiom of choice ( A C {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {AC}}} ) that is still sufficient to develop most of real analysis. It was introduced by Paul Bernays in a 1942 article that explores which set-theoretic axioms are needed to develop analysis.[lower-alpha 1]","image":"02d6856a197ea8f82d480cfc797d2718e2ddd04c.svg","url":"Axiom_of_dependent_choice"}
