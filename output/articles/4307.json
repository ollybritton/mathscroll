{"title":"Distortion (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, the distortion is a measure of the amount by which a function from the Euclidean plane to itself distorts circles to ellipses.  If the distortion of a function is equal to one, then it is conformal; if the distortion is bounded and the function is a homeomorphism, then it is quasiconformal.  The distortion of a function Æ’ of the plane is given by","image":"4966af03be5e740d240186bbde8fffa22ed4d4d7.svg","url":"Distortion_(mathematics)"}
