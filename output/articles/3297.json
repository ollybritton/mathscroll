{"title":"Contact (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, two functions have a contact of order k if, at a point P, they have the same value and k equal derivatives.  This is an equivalence relation, whose equivalence classes are generally called jets. The point of osculation is also called the double cusp. Contact is a geometric notion; it can be defined algebraically as a valuation.","image":"TangentCircle.png.webp","url":"Contact_(mathematics)"}
