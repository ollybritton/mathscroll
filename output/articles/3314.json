{"title":"Continuous big q-Hermite polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the continuous big q-Hermite polynomials  are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme. Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties.","image":"afc5632fed33a9bcaba61cc6a7c6602666db0f53.svg","url":"Continuous_big_q-Hermite_polynomials"}
