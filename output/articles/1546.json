{"title":"Betti number","summary":"In algebraic topology, the Betti numbers are used to distinguish topological spaces based on the connectivity of n-dimensional simplicial complexes. For the most reasonable finite-dimensional spaces (such as compact manifolds, finite simplicial complexes or CW complexes), the sequence of Betti numbers is 0 from some point onward (Betti numbers vanish above the dimension of a space), and they are all finite.","image":"859e8f13866d3a53fa6c81a7f7484d2fd44e99c6.svg","url":"Betti_number"}
