{"title":"Euclidean distance matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a Euclidean distance matrix is an n×n matrix representing the spacing of a set of n points in Euclidean space. For points x 1 , x 2 , … , x n {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{n}} in k-dimensional space ℝk, the elements of their Euclidean distance matrix A are given by squares of distances between them.
