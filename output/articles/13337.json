{"title":"Regularity structure","summary":"Martin Hairer's theory of regularity structures provides a framework for studying a large class of subcritical parabolic stochastic partial differential equations arising from quantum field theory.[1] The framework covers the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation , the Φ 3 4 {\\displaystyle \\Phi _{3}^{4}} equation and the parabolic Anderson model, all of which require renormalization in order to have a well-defined notion of solution.","image":"a925407a45a69ec4b4384dcf357fc722dd054d41.svg","url":"Regularity_structure"}
