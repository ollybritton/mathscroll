{"title":"Algebraic integer","summary":"In algebraic number theory, an algebraic integer is a complex number which is integral over the integers. That is, an algebraic integer is a complex root of some monic polynomial (a polynomial whose leading coefficient is 1) whose coefficients are integers. The set of all algebraic integers A is closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication and therefore is a commutative subring of the complex numbers.","image":"449494a083e0a1fda2b61c62b2f09b6bee4633dc.svg","url":"Algebraic_integer"}
