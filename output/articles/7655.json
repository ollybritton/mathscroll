{"title":"Illustration of the central limit theorem","summary":"In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that, in many situations, when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution. This article gives two illustrations of this theorem. Both involve the sum of independent and identically-distributed random variables and show how the probability distribution of the sum approaches the normal distribution as the number of terms in the sum increases.","image":"Central_limit_thm_1.png.webp","url":"Illustration_of_the_central_limit_theorem"}
