{"title":"Quaquaversal tiling","summary":"The quaquaversal tiling is a nonperiodic tiling of the euclidean 3-space introduced by John Conway and Charles Radin. The basic solid tiles are half prisms arranged in a pattern that relies essentially on their previous construct, the pinwheel tiling. The rotations relating these tiles belong to the group G(6,4) generated by two rotations of order 6 and 4 whose axes are perpendicular to each other. These rotations are dense in SO(3).","image":"Quaquaversal_Tiling.svg.png.webp","url":"Quaquaversal_tiling"}
