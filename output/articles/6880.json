{"title":"Harborth's conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, Harborth's conjecture states that every planar graph has a planar drawing in which every edge is a straight segment of integer length.[1][2][3] This conjecture is named after Heiko Harborth, and (if true) would strengthen Fáry's theorem on the existence of straight-line drawings for every planar graph. For this reason, a drawing with integer edge lengths is also known as an integral Fáry embedding.[4] Despite much subsequent research, Harborth's conjecture remains unsolved.[5]","image":"Integer_octahedral_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Harborth's_conjecture"}
