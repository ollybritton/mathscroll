{"title":"Existential generalization","summary":"In predicate logic, existential generalization[1][2] (also known as existential introduction, ∃I) is a valid rule of inference that allows one to move from a specific statement, or one instance, to a quantified generalized statement, or existential proposition. In first-order logic, it is often used as a rule for the existential quantifier ( ∃ {\\displaystyle \\exists } ) in formal proofs.","image":"77ed842b6b90b2fdd825320cf8e5265fa937b583.svg","url":"Existential_generalization"}
