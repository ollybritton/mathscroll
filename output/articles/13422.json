{"title":"Resistance distance","summary":"In graph theory, the resistance distance between two vertices of a simple, connected graph, G, is equal to the resistance between two equivalent points on an electrical network, constructed so as to correspond to G, with each edge being replaced by a resistance of one ohm. It is a metric on graphs.","image":"52539f3a079ccd3cda0e181b3c0d21ed91591e47.svg","url":"Resistance_distance"}
