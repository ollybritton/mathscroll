{"title":"Component (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, a component of an undirected graph is a connected subgraph that is not part of any larger connected subgraph. The components of any graph partition its vertices into disjoint sets, and are the induced subgraphs of those sets. A graph that is itself connected has exactly one component, consisting of the whole graph. Components are sometimes called connected components.","image":"Pseudoforest.svg.png.webp","url":"Component_(graph_theory)"}
