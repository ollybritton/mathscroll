{"title":"Truncated trapezohedron","summary":"In geometry, an n-gonal truncated trapezohedron is a polyhedron formed by a n-gonal trapezohedron with n-gonal pyramids truncated from its two polar axis vertices. If the polar vertices are completely truncated (diminished), a trapezohedron becomes an antiprism.","image":"Pentagonal_truncated_trapezohedron.png.webp","url":"Truncated_trapezohedron"}
