{"title":"Interpretation (model theory)","summary":"In model theory, interpretation of a structure M in another structure N (typically of a different signature) is a technical notion that approximates the idea of representing M inside N. For example, every reduct or definitional expansion of a structure N has an interpretation in N.","image":"aa1d2a76dd341c53305b3cfbca575ec4c068bfd1.svg","url":"Interpretation_(model_theory)"}
