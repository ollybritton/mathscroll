{"title":"Fundamental theorem of calculus","summary":"The fundamental theorem of calculus is a theorem that links the concept of differentiating a function (calculating its slopes, or rate of change at each time) with the concept of integrating a function (calculating the area under its graph, or the cumulative effect of small contributions). The two operations are inverses of each other apart from a constant value which depends on where one starts to compute area.","image":"FTC_geometric.svg.png.webp","url":"Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus"}
