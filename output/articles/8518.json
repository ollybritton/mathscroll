{"title":"K-Poincaré group","summary":"In physics and mathematics, the κ-Poincaré group, named after Henri Poincaré, is a quantum group, obtained by deformation of the Poincaré group into a Hopf algebra. It is generated by the elements a μ {\\displaystyle a^{\\mu }} and Λ μ ν {\\displaystyle {\\Lambda ^{\\mu }}_{\\nu }} with the usual constraint:","image":"d06d5d3e4ce17e6a855b3b65a714c14c23dac392.svg","url":"K-Poincaré_group"}
