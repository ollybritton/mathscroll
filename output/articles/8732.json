{"title":"Kleene's recursion theorem","summary":"In computability theory,  Kleene's recursion theorems are a pair of fundamental results about the application of computable functions to their own descriptions.    The theorems were first proved by Stephen Kleene in 1938[1] and appear in his 1952 book Introduction to Metamathematics.[2] A related theorem, which constructs fixed points of a computable function, is known as Rogers's theorem and is due to Hartley Rogers, Jr.[3]","image":"33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e.svg","url":"Kleene's_recursion_theorem"}
