{"title":"Hopf fibration","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential topology, the Hopf fibration (also known as the Hopf bundle or Hopf map) describes a 3-sphere (a hypersphere in four-dimensional space) in terms of circles and an ordinary sphere. Discovered by Heinz Hopf in 1931, it is an influential early example of a fiber bundle. Technically, Hopf found a many-to-one continuous function (or \"map\") from the 3-sphere onto the 2-sphere such that each distinct point of the 2-sphere is mapped from a distinct great circle of the 3-sphere (Hopf 1931).[1] Thus the 3-sphere is composed of fibers, where each fiber is a circle â€” one for each point of the 2-sphere.","image":"Hopf_Fibration.png.webp","url":"Hopf_fibration"}
