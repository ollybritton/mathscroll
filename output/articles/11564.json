{"title":"Ore's theorem","summary":"Ore's theorem is a result in graph theory proved in 1960 by Norwegian mathematician Ã˜ystein Ore. It gives a sufficient condition for a graph to be Hamiltonian, essentially stating that a graph with sufficiently many edges must contain a Hamilton cycle. Specifically, the theorem considers the sum of the degrees of pairs of non-adjacent vertices: if every such pair has a sum that at least equals the total number of vertices in the graph, then the graph is Hamiltonian.","image":"Ore_theorem_example.svg.png.webp","url":"Ore's_theorem"}
