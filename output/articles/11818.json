{"title":"Parity of a permutation","summary":"In mathematics, when X is a finite set with at least two elements, the permutations of X (i.e. the bijective functions from X to X) fall into two classes of equal size: the even permutations and the odd permutations. If any total ordering of X is fixed, the parity (oddness or evenness) of a permutation σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } of X can be defined as the parity of the number of inversions for σ, i.e., of pairs of elements x, y of X such that x < y and σ(x) > σ(y).","image":"59f59b7c3e6fdb1d0365a494b81fb9a696138c36.svg","url":"Parity_of_a_permutation"}
