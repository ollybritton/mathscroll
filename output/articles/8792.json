{"title":"Kolmogorov backward equations (diffusion)","summary":"The Kolmogorov backward equation (KBE) (diffusion) and its adjoint sometimes known as the Kolmogorov forward equation (diffusion) are partial differential equations (PDE) that arise in the theory of continuous-time continuous-state Markov processes.  Both were published by Andrey Kolmogorov in 1931.[1]  Later it was realized that the forward equation was already known to physicists under the name Fokkerâ€“Planck equation;  the KBE on the other hand was new.","image":"681af348d346c514eab570853fc9d2185cd9ea77.svg","url":"Kolmogorov_backward_equations_(diffusion)"}
