{"title":"Beta rectangular distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the beta rectangular distribution is a probability distribution that is a finite mixture distribution of the beta distribution and the continuous uniform distribution.  The support is of the distribution is indicated by the parameters a and b, which are the minimum and maximum values respectively.  The distribution provides an alternative to the beta distribution such that it allows more density to be placed at the extremes of the bounded interval of support.[1]  Thus it is a bounded distribution that allows for outliers to have a greater chance of occurring than does the beta distribution.","image":"Beta_rect_pdf.svg.png.webp","url":"Beta_rectangular_distribution"}
