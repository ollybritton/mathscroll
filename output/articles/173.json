{"title":"Manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, an n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold, or n {\\displaystyle n} -manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"A%2fManifold"}
