{"title":"Ideal point","summary":"In hyperbolic geometry, an ideal point, omega point[1] or point at infinity is a well-defined point outside the hyperbolic plane or space. Given a line l and a point P not on l, right- and left-limiting parallels to l through P converge to l at ideal points.","image":"Ideal_circles.svg.png.webp","url":"Ideal_point"}
