{"title":"Absorbing set","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics an absorbing set in a vector space is a set S {\\displaystyle S} which can be \"inflated\" or \"scaled up\" to eventually always include any given point of the vector space. Alternative terms are radial or absorbent set. Every neighborhood of the origin in every topological vector space is an absorbing subset.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Absorbing_set"}
