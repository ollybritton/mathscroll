{"title":"Affine differential geometry","summary":"Affine differential geometry is a type of differential geometry which studies invariants of volume-preserving affine transformations. The name affine differential geometry follows from Klein's Erlangen program. The basic difference between affine and Riemannian differential geometry is that affine differential geometry studies manifolds equipped with a volume form rather than a metric.","image":"AffineNormDrDec.jpeg.webp","url":"Affine_differential_geometry"}
