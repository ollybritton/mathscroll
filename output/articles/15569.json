{"title":"Tensor operator","summary":"In pure and applied mathematics, quantum mechanics and computer graphics, a tensor operator generalizes the notion of operators which are scalars and vectors. A special class of these are spherical tensor operators which apply the notion of the spherical basis and spherical harmonics. The spherical basis closely relates to the description of angular momentum in quantum mechanics and spherical harmonic functions. The coordinate-free generalization of a tensor operator is known as a representation operator.[1]","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Tensor_operator"}
