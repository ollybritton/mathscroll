{"title":"Irregularity of a surface","summary":"In mathematics, the irregularity of a complex surface X is the Hodge number h 0 , 1 = dim ‚Å° H 1 ( O X ) {\\displaystyle h^{0,1}=\\dim H^{1}({\\mathcal {O}}_{X})} , usually denoted by q.[1] The irregularity of an algebraic surface is sometimes defined to be this Hodge number, and sometimes defined to be the dimension of the Picard variety, which is the same in characteristic 0 but can be smaller in positive characteristic.[2]","image":"bd6fb24e2c7b3d8b2d0744071788d9830b90fa4e.svg","url":"Irregularity_of_a_surface"}
