{"title":"Estimation of covariance matrices","summary":"In statistics, sometimes the covariance matrix of a multivariate random variable is not known but has to be estimated. Estimation of covariance matrices then deals with the question of how to approximate the actual covariance matrix on the basis of a sample from the multivariate distribution. Simple cases, where observations are complete, can be dealt with by using the sample covariance matrix. The sample covariance matrix (SCM) is an unbiased and efficient estimator of the covariance matrix if the space of covariance matrices is viewed as an extrinsic convex cone in Rp√óp; however, measured using the intrinsic geometry of positive-definite matrices, the SCM is a biased and inefficient estimator.[1] In addition, if the random variable has a normal distribution, the sample covariance matrix has a Wishart distribution and a slightly differently scaled version of it is the maximum likelihood estimate. Cases involving missing data, heteroscedasticity, or autocorrelated residuals require deeper considerations. Another issue is the robustness to outliers, to which sample covariance matrices are highly sensitive.[2][3][4]","image":"cdd1400b2d5e8baf3d9a79011f1452bb1d83c274.svg","url":"Estimation_of_covariance_matrices"}
