{"title":"Pentomino","summary":"Derived from the Greek word for '5', and \"domino\", a pentomino (or 5-omino) is a polyomino of order 5, that is, a polygon in the plane made of 5 equal-sized squares connected edge-to-edge.  When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, there are 12 different free pentominoes. When reflections are considered distinct, there are 18 one-sided pentominoes. When rotations are also considered distinct, there are 63 fixed pentominoes.","image":"All_18_Pentominoes.svg.png.webp","url":"Pentomino"}
