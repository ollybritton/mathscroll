{"title":"GCD domain","summary":"In mathematics, a GCD domain is an integral domain R with the property that any two elements have a greatest common divisor (GCD); i.e., there is a unique minimal principal ideal containing the ideal generated by two given elements. Equivalently, any two elements of R have a least common multiple (LCM).[1]","image":"78903b6b766277a9eb465a80bd156fe5e72f78d7.svg","url":"GCD_domain"}
