{"title":"Ring of modular forms","summary":"In mathematics, the ring of modular forms associated to a subgroup Γ of the special linear group SL(2, Z) is the graded ring generated by the modular forms of Γ. The study of rings of modular forms describes the algebraic structure of the space of modular forms.","image":"0449340d899528b5e9ee6c5645f1844d2d7e5bba.svg","url":"Ring_of_modular_forms"}
