{"title":"Lower limit topology","summary":"In mathematics, the lower limit topology or right half-open interval topology is a topology defined on the set R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } of real numbers; it is different from the standard topology on R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } (generated by the open intervals) and has a number of interesting properties. It is the topology generated by the basis of all half-open intervals [a,b), where a and b are real numbers.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Lower_limit_topology"}
