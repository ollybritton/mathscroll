{"title":"Dold–Kan correspondence","summary":"In mathematics, more precisely, in the theory of simplicial sets, the Dold–Kan correspondence (named after Albrecht Dold and Daniel Kan) states[1] that there is an equivalence between the category of (nonnegatively graded) chain complexes and the category of simplicial abelian groups. Moreover, under the equivalence, the n {\\displaystyle n} th homology group of a chain complex is the n {\\displaystyle n} th homotopy group of the corresponding simplicial abelian group, and a chain homotopy corresponds to a simplicial homotopy. (In fact, the correspondence preserves the respective standard model structures.)","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Dold–Kan_correspondence"}
