{"title":"Biot–Tolstoy–Medwin diffraction model","summary":"In applied mathematics, the Biot–Tolstoy–Medwin (BTM) diffraction model describes edge diffraction.  Unlike the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD), BTM does not make the high frequency assumption (in which edge lengths and distances from source and receiver are much larger than the wavelength). BTM sees use in acoustic simulations.[1]","image":"df9d0d1cdbea445e87ad472dbae237c075a79f4b.svg","url":"Biot–Tolstoy–Medwin_diffraction_model"}
