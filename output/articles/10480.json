{"title":"Minakshisundaram–Pleijel zeta function","summary":"The Minakshisundaram–Pleijel zeta function is a zeta function encoding the eigenvalues of the Laplacian of a compact Riemannian manifold. It was  introduced by Subbaramiah Minakshisundaram and Åke Pleijel (1949). The case of a compact region of the plane was treated earlier by Torsten Carleman (1935).","image":"496db33ecdad7d00eb8c295eec2656062fcc4c39.svg","url":"Minakshisundaram–Pleijel_zeta_function"}
