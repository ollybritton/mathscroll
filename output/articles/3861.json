{"title":"Decomino","summary":"A decomino, or 10-omino, is a polyomino of order 10, that is, a polygon in the plane made of 10 equal-sized squares connected edge-to-edge.[1]  When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, there are 4,655 different free decominoes (the free decominoes comprise 195 with holes and 4,460 without holes). When reflections are considered distinct, there are 9,189 one-sided decominoes. When rotations are also considered distinct, there are 36,446 fixed decominoes.[2]","image":"Decomino_with_two_axes_of_symmetry.svg.png.webp","url":"Decomino"}
