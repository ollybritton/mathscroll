{"title":"Main theorem of elimination theory","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the main theorem of elimination theory states that every projective scheme is proper. A version of this theorem predates the existence of scheme theory. It can be stated, proved, and applied in the following more classical setting. Let k be a field, denote by P k n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} _{k}^{n}} the n-dimensional projective space over k. The main theorem of elimination theory is the statement that for any n and any algebraic variety V defined over k, the projection map V × P k n → V {\\displaystyle V\\times \\mathbb {P} _{k}^{n}\\to V} sends Zariski-closed subsets to Zariski-closed subsets.","image":"e3e85fa8c924852a17194f87d8fd940c9037730a.svg","url":"Main_theorem_of_elimination_theory"}
