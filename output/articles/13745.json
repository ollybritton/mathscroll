{"title":"Round function","summary":"In topology and in calculus,  a round function is a scalar function M â†’ R {\\displaystyle M\\to {\\mathbb {R} }} , over a manifold M {\\displaystyle M} , whose critical points form one or several connected components, each homeomorphic to the circle S 1 {\\displaystyle S^{1}} , also called critical loops. They are special cases of Morse-Bott functions.","image":"00935f0156fd4a85b241d0822b342d5e600f062f.svg","url":"Round_function"}
