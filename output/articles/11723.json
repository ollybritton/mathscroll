{"title":"Paired difference test","summary":"In statistics, a paired difference test is a type of location test that is used when comparing two sets of paired measurements to assess whether their population means differ.  A paired difference test uses additional information about the sample that is not present in an ordinary unpaired testing situation, either to increase the statistical power, or to reduce the effects of confounders.","image":"39a792260af4670e019c1aedee2911f3c86cfb8c.svg","url":"Paired_difference_test"}
