{"title":"Pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda","summary":"In geometry, the pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda is one of the Johnson solids  (J33). Like the pentagonal orthocupolarotunda (J32), it can be constructed by joining a pentagonal cupola (J5) and a pentagonal rotunda (J6) along their decagonal bases. The difference is that in this solid, the two halves are rotated 36 degrees with respect to one another.","image":"Pentagonal_gyrocupolarotunda.png.webp","url":"Pentagonal_gyrocupolarotunda"}
