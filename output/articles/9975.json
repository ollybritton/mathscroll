{"title":"Markov odometer","summary":"In mathematics, a Markov odometer is a certain type of topological dynamical system. It plays a fundamental role in ergodic theory and especially in orbit theory of dynamical systems, since a theorem of H. Dye asserts that every ergodic nonsingular transformation is orbit-equivalent to a Markov odometer.[1]","image":"2dca0637ce4cd40429737faea37bfd944a2ac73d.svg","url":"Markov_odometer"}
