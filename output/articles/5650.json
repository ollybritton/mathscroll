{"title":"Frame (linear algebra)","summary":"In linear algebra, a frame of an inner product space is a generalization of a basis of a vector space to sets that may be linearly dependent. In the terminology of signal processing, a frame provides a redundant, stable way of representing a signal.[1] Frames are used in error detection and correction and the design and analysis of filter banks and more generally in applied mathematics, computer science, and engineering.[2]","image":"f5b7d49b9fa7f3a3e3c429385c9800322dcf0d00.svg","url":"Frame_(linear_algebra)"}
