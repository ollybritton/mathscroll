{"title":"Sherman function","summary":"The Sherman function describes the dependence of electron-atom scattering events on the  spin of the scattered electrons.[1] It was first evaluated theoretically by the physicist Noah Sherman and it allows the measurement of polarization of an electron beam by Mott scattering experiments.[2] A correct evaluation of the Sherman function associated to a particular experimental setup is of vital importance in experiments of spin polarized photoemission spectroscopy, which is an experimental technique which allows to obtain information about the magnetic behaviour of a sample.[3]","image":"Mott_scattering.jpg.webp","url":"Sherman_function"}
