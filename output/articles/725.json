{"title":"Ammann–Beenker tiling","summary":"In geometry, an Ammann–Beenker tiling is a nonperiodic tiling which can be generated either by an aperiodic set of prototiles as done by Robert Ammann in the 1970s, or by the cut-and-project method as done independently by F. P. M. Beenker. They are one of the five sets of tilings discovered by Ammann and described in Tilings and Patterns.[1]","image":"AmmanBeenker.png.webp","url":"Ammann–Beenker_tiling"}
