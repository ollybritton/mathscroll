{"title":"Group scheme","summary":"In mathematics, a group scheme is a type of object from algebraic geometry equipped with a composition law.  Group schemes arise naturally as symmetries of schemes, and they generalize algebraic groups, in the sense that all algebraic groups have group scheme structure, but group schemes are not necessarily connected, smooth, or defined over a field.  This extra generality allows one to study richer infinitesimal structures, and this can help one to understand and answer questions of arithmetic significance.  The category of group schemes is somewhat better behaved than that of group varieties, since all homomorphisms have kernels, and there is a well-behaved deformation theory.  Group schemes that are not algebraic groups play a significant role in arithmetic geometry and algebraic topology, since they come up in contexts of Galois representations and moduli problems.  The initial development of the theory of group schemes was due to Alexander Grothendieck, Michel Raynaud and Michel Demazure in the early 1960s.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Group_scheme"}
