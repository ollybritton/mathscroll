{"title":"Elongated pentagonal gyrobicupola","summary":"In geometry, the elongated pentagonal gyrobicupola is one of the Johnson solids (J39). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal gyrobicupola (J31) by inserting a decagonal prism between its congruent halves. Rotating one of the pentagonal cupolae (J5) through 36Â degrees before inserting the prism yields an elongated pentagonal orthobicupola  (J38).","image":"Elongated_pentagonal_gyrobicupola.png.webp","url":"Elongated_pentagonal_gyrobicupola"}
