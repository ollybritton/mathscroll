{"title":"Linear speedup theorem","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the linear speedup theorem for Turing machines states that given any real c > 0 and any k-tape Turing machine solving a problem in time f(n), there is another k-tape machine that solves the same problem in time at most f(n)/c + 2n + 3, where k > 1.[1][2] If the original machine is non-deterministic, then the new machine is also non-deterministic. The constants 2 and 3 in 2n + 3 can be lowered, for example, to n + 2.[1]","image":"821220a8a56569c42f461dab931aeb0725e22747.svg","url":"Linear_speedup_theorem"}
