{"title":"Solinas prime","summary":"In mathematics, a Solinas prime, or generalized Mersenne prime, is a prime number that has the form f ( 2 m ) {\\displaystyle f(2^{m})} , where f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} is a low-degree polynomial with small integer coefficients.[1][2] These primes allow fast modular reduction algorithms and are widely used in cryptography. They are named after Jerome Solinas.","image":"5a74d7ee00f1c07fff27f53b5942be7dc2ff3bd5.svg","url":"Solinas_prime"}
