{"title":"Bounded operator","summary":"In functional analysis and operator theory, a bounded linear operator is a linear transformation L : X → Y {\\displaystyle L:X\\to Y} between topological vector spaces (TVSs) X {\\displaystyle X} and Y {\\displaystyle Y} that maps bounded subsets of X {\\displaystyle X} to bounded subsets of Y . {\\displaystyle Y.} If X {\\displaystyle X} and Y {\\displaystyle Y} are normed vector spaces (a special type of TVS), then L {\\displaystyle L} is bounded if and only if there exists some M > 0 {\\displaystyle M>0} such that for all x ∈ X , {\\displaystyle x\\in X,}","image":"5161099c94e562d8f8feb2256789828f9f1d0533.svg","url":"Bounded_operator"}
