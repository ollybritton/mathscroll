{"title":"Differential poset","summary":"In mathematics, a differential poset is a partially ordered set (or poset for short) satisfying certain local properties.  (The formal definition is given below.)  This family of posets was introduced by Stanley (1988) as a generalization of Young's lattice (the poset of integer partitions ordered by inclusion), many of whose combinatorial properties are shared by all differential posets.  In addition to Young's lattice, the other most significant example of a differential poset is the Youngâ€“Fibonacci lattice.","image":"Young-Fibonacci.svg.png.webp","url":"Differential_poset"}
