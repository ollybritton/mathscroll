{"title":"Branch and cut","summary":"Branch and cut[1] is a method of combinatorial optimization for solving integer linear programs (ILPs), that is, linear programming (LP) problems where some or all the unknowns are restricted to integer values.[2] Branch and cut involves running a branch and bound algorithm and using cutting planes to tighten the linear programming relaxations.  Note that if cuts are only used to tighten the initial LP relaxation, the algorithm is called cut and branch.","image":"103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8.svg","url":"Branch_and_cut"}
