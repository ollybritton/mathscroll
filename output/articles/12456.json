{"title":"Preferential attachment","summary":"A preferential attachment process is any of a class of processes in which some quantity, typically some form of wealth or credit, is distributed among a number of individuals or objects according to how much they already have, so that those who are already wealthy receive more than those who are not.  \"Preferential attachment\" is only the most recent of many names that have been given to such processes.  They are also referred to under the names Yule process, cumulative advantage, the rich get richer, and the Matthew effect. They are also related to Gibrat's law. The principal reason for scientific interest in preferential attachment is that it can, under suitable circumstances, generate power law distributions.[1] If preferential attachment is non-linear, measured distributions may deviate from a power law.[2] These mechanisms may generate distributions which are approximately power law over transient periods.[3][4]","image":"Graph_with_Preferential_attachment.png.webp","url":"Preferential_attachment"}
