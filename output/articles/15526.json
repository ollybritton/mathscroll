{"title":"Tate–Shafarevich group","summary":"In arithmetic geometry, the  Tate–Shafarevich group  Ш(A/K) of an abelian variety A (or more generally a group scheme) defined over a number field K consists of the elements of the Weil–Châtelet group WC(A/K) = H1(GK, A) that become trivial in all of the completions of K (i.e. the p-adic fields obtained from K, as well as its real and complex completions). Thus, in terms of Galois cohomology, it can be written as","image":"ee2067c328d97080df252618e3e461202c266d63.svg","url":"Tate–Shafarevich_group"}
