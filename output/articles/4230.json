{"title":"DisCoCat","summary":"DisCoCat (Categorical Compositional Distributional) is a mathematical framework for natural language processing which uses category theory to unify distributional semantics with the principle of compositionality. The grammatical derivations in a categorial grammar (usually a pregroup grammar) are interpreted as linear maps acting on the tensor product of word vectors to produce the meaning of a sentence or a piece of text. String diagrams are used to visualise information flow and reason about natural language semantics.","image":"f6d9c60d3cf462a9812e9a9d021d17c7bc272a5a.svg","url":"DisCoCat"}
