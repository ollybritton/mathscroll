{"title":"Total relation","summary":"In mathematics, a binary relation R ⊆ X×Y between two sets X and Y is total (or left total) if the source set X equals the domain {x : there is a y with xRy }. Conversely, R is called right total if Y equals the range {y : there is an x with xRy }.","image":"b8705438171d938b7f59cd1bfa5b7d99b6afa5cd.svg","url":"Total_relation"}
