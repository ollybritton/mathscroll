{"title":"Biangular coordinates","summary":"In mathematics, biangular coordinates are a coordinate system for the plane where C 1 {\\displaystyle C_{1}} and C 2 {\\displaystyle C_{2}} are two fixed points, and the position of a point P not on the line C 1 C 2 ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\overline {C_{1}C_{2}}}} is determined by the angles ∠ P C 1 C 2 {\\displaystyle \\angle PC_{1}C_{2}} and ∠ P C 2 C 1 . {\\displaystyle \\angle PC_{2}C_{1}.} [1]","image":"babf569931f1a7b5182b9bec51873c2f5692fbb8.svg","url":"Biangular_coordinates"}
