{"title":"Cartan subalgebra","summary":"In mathematics,  a Cartan subalgebra, often abbreviated as CSA, is a nilpotent subalgebra h {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {h}}} of a Lie algebra g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} that is self-normalising (if [ X , Y ] ∈ h {\\displaystyle [X,Y]\\in {\\mathfrak {h}}} for all X ∈ h {\\displaystyle X\\in {\\mathfrak {h}}} , then Y ∈ h {\\displaystyle Y\\in {\\mathfrak {h}}} ). They were introduced by Élie Cartan in his doctoral thesis. It  controls the representation theory of a semi-simple Lie algebra g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} over a field of characteristic 0 {\\displaystyle 0} .","image":"b8f80a9d9b4cf9b0b6f562d5eff0f290da478ebe.svg","url":"Cartan_subalgebra"}
