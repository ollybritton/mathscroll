{"title":"Rathjen's psi function","summary":"In mathematics, Rathjen's Ïˆ {\\displaystyle \\psi } psi function is an ordinal collapsing function developed by Michael Rathjen. It collapses weakly Mahlo cardinals M {\\displaystyle M} to generate large countable ordinals.[1] A weakly Mahlo cardinal is a cardinal such that the set of regular cardinals below M {\\displaystyle M} is closed under M {\\displaystyle M} (i.e. all normal functions closed in M {\\displaystyle M} are closed under some regular ordinal < M {\\displaystyle <M} ). Rathjen uses this to diagonalise over the weakly inaccessible hierarchy.","image":"45e5789e5d9c8f7c79744f43ecaaf8ba42a8553a.svg","url":"Rathjen's_psi_function"}
