{"title":"Smooth number","summary":"In number theory, an n-smooth (or n-friable) number is an integer whose prime factors are all less than or equal to n.[1][2] For example, a 7-smooth number is a number whose every prime factor is at most 7, so 49 = 72 and 15750 = 2 × 32 × 53 × 7 are both 7-smooth, while 11 and 702 = 2 × 33 × 13 are not 7-smooth. The term seems to have been coined by Leonard Adleman.[3] Smooth numbers are especially important in cryptography, which relies on factorization of integers. The 2-smooth numbers are just the powers of 2, while 5-smooth numbers are known as regular numbers.","image":"2486971cee7f4d6e32790ce77c77468c2139dcc4.svg","url":"Smooth_number"}
