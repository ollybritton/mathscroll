{"title":"Geodesic bicombing","summary":"In metric geometry, a geodesic bicombing distinguishes a class of geodesics of a metric space. The study of metric spaces with distinguished geodesics traces back to the work of the mathematician Herbert Busemann.[1] The convention to call a collection of paths of a metric space bicombing is due to William Thurston.[2] By imposing a weak global non-positive curvature condition on a geodesic bicombing several results from the theory of CAT(0) spaces and Banach space theory may be recovered in a more general setting.","image":"cb4d7a16bca9e216c0221b43a1c3377aa5e358b8.svg","url":"Geodesic_bicombing"}
