{"title":"Hyperconnected space","summary":"In the mathematical field of topology, a hyperconnected space[1] or irreducible space[2] is a topological space X that cannot be written as the union of two proper closed sets (whether disjoint or non-disjoint). The name irreducible space is preferred in algebraic geometry.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Hyperconnected_space"}
