{"title":"Quasi-polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, a quasi-polynomial (pseudo-polynomial) is a generalization of polynomials. While the coefficients of a polynomial come from a ring, the coefficients of quasi-polynomials are instead periodic functions with integral period. Quasi-polynomials appear throughout much of combinatorics as the enumerators for various objects.","image":"18ffd6746c6aa058f3b16ce4b2747ab8bc255f59.svg","url":"Quasi-polynomial"}
