{"title":"Great ditrigonal dodecacronic hexecontahedron","summary":"In geometry, the great ditrigonal dodecacronic hexecontahedron (or great lanceal trisicosahedron) is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron. It is the dual of the uniform great ditrigonal dodecicosidodecahedron. Its faces are kites. Part of each kite lies inside the solid, hence is invisible in solid models.","image":"DU42_great_ditrigonal_dodecacronic_hexecontahedron.png.webp","url":"Great_ditrigonal_dodecacronic_hexecontahedron"}
