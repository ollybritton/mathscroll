{"title":"Characteristic class","summary":"In mathematics, a characteristic class is a way of associating to each principal bundle of X a cohomology class of X. The cohomology class measures the extent the bundle is \"twisted\" and whether it possesses sections. Characteristic classes are global invariants that measure the deviation of a local product structure from a global product structure. They are one of the unifying geometric concepts in algebraic topology, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Characteristic_class"}
