{"title":"Fátima de Madrid","summary":"Fátima de Madrid is the name given to an Arab Muslim astronomer and mathematician who supposedly lived during the late 10th and early 11th centuries in Islamic Spain. She was purportedly the daughter of the astronomer Maslama al-Majriti, with whom she is said to have worked on several astronomical and mathematical treatises, including the astronomical tables of Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi. The earliest known account of her is the 1924 edition of the Enciclopedia Espasa-Calpe, and historians have cast doubt on whether she actually existed.[1]","image":"Astrolabe_calculation.jpg.webp","url":"Fátima_de_Madrid"}
