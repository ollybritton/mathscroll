{"title":"Modus tollens","summary":"In propositional logic, modus tollens (/ˈmoʊdəs ˈtɒlɛnz/) (MT), also known as modus tollendo tollens (Latin for \"method of removing by taking away\")[2] and denying the consequent,[3] is a deductive argument form and a rule of inference. Modus tollens takes the form of \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" It is an application of the general truth that if a statement is true, then so is its contrapositive. The form shows that inference from P implies Q to the negation of Q implies the negation of P is a valid argument.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Modus_tollens"}
