{"title":"Lyndon word","summary":"In mathematics, in the areas of combinatorics and computer science, a Lyndon word is a nonempty string that is strictly smaller in lexicographic order than all of its rotations. Lyndon words are named after mathematician Roger Lyndon, who investigated them in 1954, calling them standard lexicographic sequences.[1] Anatoly Shirshov introduced Lyndon words in 1953 calling them regular words.[2]  Lyndon words are a special case of Hall words; almost all properties of Lyndon words are shared by Hall words.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Lyndon_word"}
