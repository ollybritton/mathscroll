{"title":"Dual polyhedron","summary":"In geometry, every polyhedron is associated with a second dual structure, where the vertices of one correspond to the faces of the other, and the edges between pairs of vertices of one correspond to the edges between pairs of faces of the other.[1] Such dual figures remain combinatorial or abstract polyhedra, but not all can also be constructed as geometric polyhedra.[2] Starting with any given polyhedron, the dual of its dual is the original polyhedron.","image":"Polyhedron_pair_6-8.png.webp","url":"Dual_polyhedron"}
