{"title":"Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in real analysis, the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, named after Bernard Bolzano and Karl Weierstrass, is a fundamental result about convergence in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} . The theorem states that each infinite bounded sequence in R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} has a convergent subsequence.[1] An equivalent formulation is that a subset of R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} is sequentially compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.[2] The theorem is sometimes called the sequential compactness theorem.[3]","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Bolzano–Weierstrass_theorem"}
