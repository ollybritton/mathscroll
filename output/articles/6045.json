{"title":"General recursive function","summary":"In mathematical logic and computer science, a general recursive function, partial recursive function, or μ-recursive function is a partial function from natural numbers to natural numbers that is \"computable\" in an intuitive sense – as well as in a formal one. If the function is total, it is also called a total recursive function (sometimes shortened to recursive function).[1] In computability theory, it is shown that the μ-recursive functions are precisely the functions that can be computed by Turing machines[2][4] (this is one of the theorems that supports the Church–Turing thesis).  The μ-recursive functions are closely related to primitive recursive functions, and their inductive definition (below) builds upon that of the primitive recursive functions. However, not every total recursive function is a primitive recursive function—the most famous example is the Ackermann function.","image":"c37184786012801a8d6a2123ad2e2af0bd9f5e54.svg","url":"General_recursive_function"}
