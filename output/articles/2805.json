{"title":"Coarea formula","summary":"In the mathematical field of geometric measure theory, the coarea formula expresses the integral of a function over an open set in Euclidean space in terms of integrals over the level sets of another function.  A special case is Fubini's theorem, which says under suitable hypotheses that the integral of a function over the region enclosed by a rectangular box can be written as the iterated integral over the level sets of the coordinate functions.  Another special case is integration in spherical coordinates, in which the integral of a function on Rn is related to the integral of the function over spherical shells: level sets of the radial function.  The formula plays a decisive role in the modern study of isoperimetric problems.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Coarea_formula"}
