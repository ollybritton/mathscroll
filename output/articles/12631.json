{"title":"Prolate spheroidal coordinates","summary":"Prolate spheroidal coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from rotating the two-dimensional elliptic coordinate system about the focal axis of the ellipse, i.e., the symmetry axis on which the foci are located.  Rotation about the other axis produces oblate spheroidal coordinates.  Prolate spheroidal coordinates can also be considered as a limiting case of ellipsoidal coordinates in which the two smallest principal axes are equal in length.","image":"Prolate_spheroidal_coordinates.png.webp","url":"Prolate_spheroidal_coordinates"}
