{"title":"Certificate (complexity)","summary":"In computational complexity theory, a certificate (also called a witness) is a string that certifies the answer to a computation, or certifies the membership of some string in a language. A certificate is often thought of as a solution path within a verification process, which is used to check whether a problem gives the answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Certificate_(complexity)"}
