{"title":"Dirac bracket","summary":"The Dirac bracket is a generalization of the Poisson bracket developed by Paul Dirac[1] to treat classical systems with second class constraints in Hamiltonian mechanics, and to thus allow them to undergo canonical quantization. It is an important part of Dirac's development of Hamiltonian mechanics to elegantly handle more general Lagrangians; specifically, when constraints are at hand, so that the number of apparent variables exceeds that of dynamical ones.[2] More abstractly, the two-form implied from the Dirac bracket is the restriction of the symplectic form to the constraint surface in phase space.[3]","image":"e5c81518fa1cfea4c4c0e9b083748dc9cea480c6.svg","url":"Dirac_bracket"}
