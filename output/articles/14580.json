{"title":"Smooth functor","summary":"In differential topology, a branch of mathematics, a smooth functor is a type of functor defined on finite-dimensional real vector spaces.  Intuitively, a smooth functor is smooth in the sense that it sends smoothly parameterized families of vector spaces to smoothly parameterized families of vector spaces.  Smooth functors may therefore be uniquely extended to functors defined on vector bundles.","image":"36dd53093afc427253492b0be250dd266e805888.svg","url":"Smooth_functor"}
