{"title":"Linear dynamical system","summary":"Linear dynamical systems are dynamical systems whose evaluation functions are linear.  While dynamical systems, in general, do not have closed-form solutions, linear dynamical systems can be solved exactly, and they have a rich set of mathematical properties.  Linear systems can also be used to understand the qualitative behavior of general dynamical systems, by calculating the equilibrium points of the system and approximating it as a linear system around each such point.","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Linear_dynamical_system"}
