{"title":"Kite (geometry)","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, a kite is a quadrilateral with reflection symmetry across a diagonal. Because of this symmetry, a kite has two equal angles and two pairs of adjacent equal-length sides. Kites are also known as deltoids,[1] but the word deltoid may also refer to a deltoid curve, an unrelated geometric object sometimes studied in connection with quadrilaterals.[2][3] A kite may also be called a dart,[4] particularly if it is not convex.[5][6]","image":"GeometricKite.svg.png.webp","url":"Kite_(geometry)"}
