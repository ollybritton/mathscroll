{"title":"Bootstrapping (statistics)","summary":"Bootstrapping is any test or metric that uses random sampling with replacement (e.g. mimicking the sampling process), and falls under the broader class of resampling methods. Bootstrapping assigns measures of accuracy (bias, variance, confidence intervals, prediction error, etc.) to sample estimates.[1][2] This technique allows estimation of the sampling distribution of almost any statistic using random sampling methods.[3][4]","image":"864f94e4ee3ef9ab67ee4c4140ecd21d4d14f33b.svg","url":"Bootstrapping_(statistics)"}
