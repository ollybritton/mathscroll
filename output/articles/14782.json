{"title":"Spherical design","summary":"A spherical design, part of combinatorial design theory in mathematics, is a finite set of N points on the d-dimensional unit d-sphere Sd such that the average value of any polynomial f of degree t or less on the set equals the average value of f on the whole sphere (that is, the integral of f over Sd divided by the area or measure of Sd).  Such a set is often called a spherical t-design to indicate the value of t, which is a fundamental parameter. The concept of a spherical design is due to Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel,[1] although these objects were understood as particular examples of cubature formulas earlier.","image":"2ff7e42b0c9c411cd943c668a062e8061765ce76.svg","url":"Spherical_design"}
