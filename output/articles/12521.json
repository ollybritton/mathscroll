{"title":"Principal ideal domain","summary":"In mathematics, a principal ideal domain, or PID, is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal, i.e., can be generated by a single element. More generally, a principal ideal ring is a nonzero commutative ring whose ideals are principal, although some authors (e.g., Bourbaki) refer to PIDs as principal rings. The distinction is that a principal ideal ring may have zero divisors whereas a principal ideal domain cannot.","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Principal_ideal_domain"}
