{"title":"Strong product of graphs","summary":"In graph theory, the strong product is a way of combining two graphs to make a larger graph. Two vertices are adjacent in the strong product when they come from pairs of vertices in the factor graphs that are either adjacent or identical. The strong product is one of several different graph product operations that have been studied in graph theory. The strong product of any two graphs can be constructed as the union of two other products of the same two graphs, the Cartesian product of graphs and the tensor product of graphs.","image":"King's_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Strong_product_of_graphs"}
