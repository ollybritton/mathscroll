{"title":"Cubic-triangular tiling honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the cubic-triangular tiling honeycomb is a paracompact uniform honeycomb, constructed from cube, triangular tiling, and cuboctahedron cells, in a rhombitrihexagonal tiling vertex figure. It has a single-ring Coxeter diagram, , and is named by its two regular cells.","image":"CDel_label6.png.webp","url":"Cubic-triangular_tiling_honeycomb"}
