{"title":"Poisson bracket","summary":"In mathematics and classical mechanics, the Poisson bracket is an important binary operation in Hamiltonian mechanics, playing a central role in Hamilton's equations of motion, which govern the time evolution of a Hamiltonian dynamical system. The Poisson bracket also distinguishes a certain class of coordinate transformations, called canonical transformations, which map canonical coordinate systems into canonical coordinate systems. A \"canonical coordinate system\" consists of canonical position and momentum variables (below symbolized by q i {\\displaystyle q_{i}} and p i {\\displaystyle p_{i}} , respectively) that satisfy canonical Poisson bracket relations. The set of possible canonical transformations is always very rich. For instance, it is often possible to choose the Hamiltonian itself H = H ( q , p , t ) {\\displaystyle H=H(q,p,t)} as one of the new canonical momentum coordinates.","image":"2752dcbff884354069fe332b8e51eb0a70a531b6.svg","url":"Poisson_bracket"}
