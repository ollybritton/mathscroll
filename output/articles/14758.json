{"title":"Spectrum of a matrix","summary":"In mathematics, the spectrum of a matrix is the set of its eigenvalues.[1][2][3]  More generally, if T : V → V {\\displaystyle T\\colon V\\to V} is a linear operator on any finite-dimensional vector space, its spectrum is the set of scalars λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } such that T − λ I {\\displaystyle T-\\lambda I} is not invertible. The determinant of the matrix equals the product of its eigenvalues. Similarly, the trace of the matrix equals the sum of its eigenvalues.[4][5][6] From this point of view, we can define the pseudo-determinant for a singular matrix to be the product of its nonzero eigenvalues (the density of multivariate normal distribution will need this quantity).","image":"a3a6ee7fc18a25eec79f8b0e2adff07caea23a9b.svg","url":"Spectrum_of_a_matrix"}
