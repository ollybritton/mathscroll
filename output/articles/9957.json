{"title":"Mark Kac","summary":"Mark Kac (/kɑːts/ KAHTS; Polish: Marek Kac; August 3, 1914 – October 26, 1984) was a Polish American mathematician. His main interest was probability theory. His question, \"Can one hear the shape of a drum?\" set off research into spectral theory, the idea of understanding the extent to which the spectrum allows one to read back the geometry. (In the end, the answer was \"no\", in general.)","image":"Mark_Kac.jpg.webp","url":"Mark_Kac"}
