{"title":"Weierstrass preparation theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Weierstrass preparation theorem is a tool for dealing with analytic functions of several complex variables, at a given point P. It states that such a function is, up to multiplication by a function not zero at P, a polynomial in one fixed variable z, which is monic, and whose coefficients of lower degree terms are analytic functions in the remaining variables and zero at P.","image":"9b377249ce40b761f2618e30d5d1845d67ffdfe0.svg","url":"Weierstrass_preparation_theorem"}
