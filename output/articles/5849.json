{"title":"Fundamental groupoid","summary":"In algebraic topology, the fundamental groupoid is a certain topological invariant of a topological space. It can be viewed as an extension of the more widely-known fundamental group; as such, it captures information about the homotopy type of a topological space. In terms of category theory, the fundamental groupoid is a certain functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of groupoids.","image":"910eaae0a8267ccb04d4846f6a28f02ce6ab8ac9.svg","url":"Fundamental_groupoid"}
