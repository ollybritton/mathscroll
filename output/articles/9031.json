{"title":"Laplacian smoothing","summary":"Laplacian smoothing is an algorithm to smooth a polygonal mesh.[1][2] For each vertex in a mesh, a new position is chosen based on local information (such as the position of neighbours) and the vertex is moved there. In the case that a mesh is topologically a rectangular grid (that is, each internal vertex is connected to four neighbours) then this operation produces the Laplacian of the mesh.","image":"92cc08bc5f24da054ad2d8fdb7fcf2c15346042c.svg","url":"Laplacian_smoothing"}
