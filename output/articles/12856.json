{"title":"Quantum annealing","summary":"Quantum annealing (QA) is an optimization process for finding the global minimum of a given objective function over a given set of candidate solutions (candidate states), by a process using quantum fluctuations.  Quantum annealing is used mainly for problems where the search space is discrete (combinatorial optimization problems) with many local minima; such as finding[1] the ground state of a spin glass or the traveling salesman problem. The term \"quantum annealing\" was first proposed in 1988 by B. Apolloni, N. Cesa Bianchi and D. De Falco as a quantum-inspired classical algorithm.[2][3]  It was formulated in its present form by T. Kadowaki and H. Nishimori (ja) in \"Quantum annealing in the transverse Ising model\"[4] though an imaginary-time variant without quantum coherence had been discussed by A. B. Finnila, M. A. Gomez, C. Sebenik and J. D. Doll, in \"Quantum annealing is a new method for minimizing multidimensional functions\".[5]","image":"Quantum_Annealing_Analogy.svg.png.webp","url":"Quantum_annealing"}
