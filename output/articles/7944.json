{"title":"Intersection number","summary":"In mathematics, and especially in algebraic geometry, the intersection number generalizes the intuitive notion of counting the number of times two curves intersect to higher dimensions, multiple (more than 2) curves, and accounting properly for tangency. One needs a definition of intersection number in order to state results like BÃ©zout's theorem.","image":"2e06849d387cca60f1ac9f0fc3434c240048d965.svg","url":"Intersection_number"}
