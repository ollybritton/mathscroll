{"title":"Gyroelongated triangular bicupola","summary":"In geometry, the gyroelongated triangular bicupola is one of the Johnson solids  (J44). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a triangular bicupola (either triangular orthobicupola, J27, or the cuboctahedron) by inserting a hexagonal antiprism between its congruent halves.","image":"Gyroelongated_triangular_bicupola.png.webp","url":"Gyroelongated_triangular_bicupola"}
