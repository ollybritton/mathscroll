{"title":"Explicit and implicit methods","summary":"Explicit and implicit methods are approaches used in numerical analysis for obtaining numerical approximations to the solutions of time-dependent ordinary and partial differential equations, as is required in computer simulations of physical processes. Explicit methods calculate the state of a system at a later time from the state of the system at the current time, while implicit methods find a solution by solving an equation involving both the current state of the system and the later one. Mathematically, if Y ( t ) {\\displaystyle Y(t)} is the current system state and Y ( t + Δ t ) {\\displaystyle Y(t+\\Delta t)} is the state at the later time ( Δ t {\\displaystyle \\Delta t} is a small time step), then, for an explicit method","image":"b160c901a32a90bdf180749f101db13c894cbed2.svg","url":"Explicit_and_implicit_methods"}
