{"title":"Equilateral dimension","summary":"In mathematics, the equilateral dimension of a metric space is the maximum size of any subset of the space whose points are all at equal distances to each other.[1] Equilateral dimension has also been called \"metric dimension\", but the term \"metric dimension\" also has many other inequivalent usages.[1] The equilateral dimension of a d {\\displaystyle d} -dimensional Euclidean space is d + 1 {\\displaystyle d+1} , achieved by a regular simplex, and the equilateral dimension of a d {\\displaystyle d} -dimensional vector space with the Chebyshev distance ( L âˆž {\\displaystyle L^{\\infty }} norm) is 2 d {\\displaystyle 2^{d}} , achieved by a hypercube. However, the equilateral dimension of a space with the Manhattan distance ( L 1 {\\displaystyle L^{1}} norm) is not known; Kusner's conjecture, named after Robert B. Kusner, states that it is exactly 2 d {\\displaystyle 2d} , achieved by a cross polytope.[2]","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Equilateral_dimension"}
