{"title":"Orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle","summary":"In mathematics, orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle are families of polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to integration over the unit circle in the complex plane, for some probability measure on the unit circle. They were  introduced  by Szegő (1920, 1921, 1939).","image":"9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161.svg","url":"Orthogonal_polynomials_on_the_unit_circle"}
