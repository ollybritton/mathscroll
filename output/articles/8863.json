{"title":"Krylov–Bogoliubov averaging method","summary":"The Krylov–Bogolyubov averaging method (Krylov–Bogolyubov method of averaging) is a mathematical method for approximate analysis of oscillating processes in non-linear mechanics.[1] The method is based on the averaging principle when the exact differential equation of the motion is replaced by its averaged version. The method is named after Nikolay Krylov and Nikolay Bogoliubov.","image":"da5a3d24b1559a201a97d804cc762f83ccb60c30.svg","url":"Krylov–Bogoliubov_averaging_method"}
