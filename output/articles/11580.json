{"title":"Orlicz space","summary":"In mathematical analysis, and especially in real, harmonic analysis and functional analysis, an Orlicz space is a type of function space which generalizes the Lp spaces.  Like the Lp spaces, they are Banach spaces. The spaces are named for Władysław Orlicz, who was the first to define them in 1932.","image":"d0ee91dae5ba1c344a5552c2c9d09beee9c3a427.svg","url":"Orlicz_space"}
