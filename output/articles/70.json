{"title":"3-sphere","summary":"In mathematics, a 3-sphere, glome or hypersphere is a higher-dimensional analogue of a sphere. It may be embedded in 4-dimensional Euclidean space as the set of points equidistant from a fixed central point.  Analogous to how the boundary of a ball in three dimensions is an ordinary sphere (or 2-sphere, a two-dimensional surface), the boundary of a ball in four dimensions is a 3-sphere (an object with three dimensions).  A 3-sphere is an example of a 3-manifold and an n-sphere.","image":"Hypersphere_coord.PNG.webp","url":"3-sphere"}
