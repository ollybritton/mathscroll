{"title":"Linear Lie algebra","summary":"In algebra, a linear Lie algebra is a subalgebra g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} of the Lie algebra g l ( V ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {gl}}(V)} consisting of endomorphisms of a vector space V. In other words, a linear Lie algebra is the image of a Lie algebra representation.","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Linear_Lie_algebra"}
