{"title":"Euler characteristic","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in algebraic topology and polyhedral combinatorics, the Euler characteristic (or Euler number, or Euler–Poincaré characteristic) is a topological invariant, a number that describes a topological space's shape or structure regardless of the way it is bent. It is commonly denoted by χ {\\displaystyle \\chi } (Greek lower-case letter chi).","image":"656111758322ace96d80a9371771aa6d3de25437.svg","url":"Euler_characteristic"}
