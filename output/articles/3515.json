{"title":"Covering number","summary":"In mathematics, a covering number is the number of spherical balls of a given size needed to completely cover a given space, with possible overlaps. Two related concepts are the packing number, the number of disjoint balls that fit in a space, and the metric entropy, the number of points that fit in a space when constrained to lie at some fixed minimum distance apart.","image":"5f924007d1da72ec2a48ad731b023d5b7f88be27.svg","url":"Covering_number"}
