{"title":"Small triambic icosahedron","summary":"In geometry, the small triambic icosahedron is a star polyhedron composed of 20 intersecting non-regular hexagon faces. It has 60 edges and 32 vertices, and Euler characteristic of −8. It is an isohedron, meaning that all of its faces are symmetric to each other. Branko Grünbaum has conjectured that it is the only Euclidean isohedron with convex faces of six or more sides,[1] but the small hexagonal hexecontahedron is another example.","image":"DU30_small_triambic_icosahedron.png.webp","url":"Small_triambic_icosahedron"}
