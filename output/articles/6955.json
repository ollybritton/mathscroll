{"title":"Hausdorff distance","summary":"In mathematics, the Hausdorff distance, or Hausdorff metric, also called Pompeiuâ€“Hausdorff distance,[1][2] measures how far two subsets of a metric space are from each other. It turns the set of non-empty compact subsets of a metric space into a metric space in its own right. It is named after Felix Hausdorff and Dimitrie Pompeiu.","image":"2ba760bfd27326a71ffc31cffaaee141f356d7b2.svg","url":"Hausdorff_distance"}
