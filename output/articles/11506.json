{"title":"Order-6 tetrahedral honeycomb","summary":"In hyperbolic 3-space, the order-6 tetrahedral honeycomb is a paracompact regular space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). It is paracompact because it has vertex figures composed of an infinite number of faces, and has all vertices as ideal points at infinity. With Schl√§fli symbol {3,3,6}, the order-6 tetrahedral honeycomb has six ideal tetrahedra around each edge. All vertices are ideal, with infinitely many tetrahedra existing around each vertex in a triangular tiling vertex figure.[1]","image":"H3_336_CC_center.png.webp","url":"Order-6_tetrahedral_honeycomb"}
