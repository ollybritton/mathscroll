{"title":"Bimetric gravity","summary":"Bimetric gravity or bigravity refers to two different classes of theories. The first class of theories relies on modified mathematical theories of gravity (or gravitation) in which two metric tensors are used instead of one.[1][2] The second metric may be introduced at high energies, with the implication that the speed of light could be energy-dependent, enabling models with a variable speed of light.","image":"e319a4a98015c8117cab3bb268a4cc7d43df4a5c.svg","url":"Bimetric_gravity"}
