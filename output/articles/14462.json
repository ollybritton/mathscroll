{"title":"Sinuosity","summary":"Sinuosity, sinuosity index, or sinuosity coefficient of a continuously differentiable curve having at least one inflection point is the ratio of the curvilinear length (along the curve) and the Euclidean distance (straight line) between the end points of the curve. This dimensionless quantity can also be rephrased as the \"actual path length\" divided by the \"shortest path length\" of a curve. The value ranges from 1 (case of straight line) to infinity (case of a closed loop, where the shortest path length is zero or for an infinitely-long actual path[1]).","image":"Sinuosity.png.webp","url":"Sinuosity"}
