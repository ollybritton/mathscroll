{"title":"Line group","summary":"A line group is a mathematical way of describing symmetries associated with moving along a line. These symmetries include repeating along that line, making that line a one-dimensional lattice. However, line groups may have more than one dimension, and they may involve those dimensions in its isometries or symmetry transformations.","image":"Frieze_group_11.png.webp","url":"Line_group"}
