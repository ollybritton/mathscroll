{"title":"Gompertz function","summary":"The Gompertz curve or Gompertz function is a type of mathematical model for a time series, named after Benjamin Gompertz (1779â€“1865). It is a sigmoid function which describes growth as being slowest at the start and end of a given time period. The right-side or future value asymptote of the function is approached much more gradually by the curve than the left-side or lower valued asymptote. This is in contrast to the simple logistic function in which both asymptotes are approached by the curve symmetrically. It is a special case of the generalised logistic function. The function was originally designed to describe human mortality, but since has been modified to be applied in biology, with regard to detailing populations.","image":"Gompertz-a.svg.png.webp","url":"Gompertz_function"}
