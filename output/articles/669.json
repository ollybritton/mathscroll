{"title":"Almost simple group","summary":"In mathematics, a group is said to be almost simple if it contains a non-abelian simple group and is contained within the automorphism group of that simple group – that is, if it fits between a (non-abelian) simple group and its automorphism group. In symbols, a group A is almost simple if there is a (non-abelian) simple group S such that S ≤ A ≤ Aut ⁡ ( S ) . {\\displaystyle S\\leq A\\leq \\operatorname {Aut} (S).}","image":"68e95e6f3ba9bc4e32a1fcd38a9c597493c9fab5.svg","url":"Almost_simple_group"}
