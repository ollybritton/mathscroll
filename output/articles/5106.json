{"title":"Evasive Boolean function","summary":"In mathematics, an evasive Boolean function ƒ (of n variables) is a Boolean function for which every decision tree algorithm has running time of exactly n.  Consequently, every decision tree algorithm that represents the function has, at worst case, a running time of n.","image":"470862be2348070dfdac0aa9dd68a3bcee52c58e.svg","url":"Evasive_Boolean_function"}
