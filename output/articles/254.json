{"title":"Abel–Jacobi map","summary":"In mathematics, the Abel–Jacobi map is a construction of algebraic geometry which relates an algebraic curve to its Jacobian variety. In Riemannian geometry, it is a more general construction mapping a manifold to its Jacobi torus. The name derives from the theorem of Abel and Jacobi that two effective divisors are linearly equivalent if and only if they are indistinguishable under the Abel–Jacobi map.","image":"f000a53d55dd69a0c85a5d8c73efc1390f79d807.svg","url":"Abel–Jacobi_map"}
