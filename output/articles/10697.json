{"title":"Morava K-theory","summary":"In stable homotopy theory, a branch of mathematics, Morava K-theory is one of a collection of cohomology theories introduced in algebraic topology by Jack Morava in unpublished preprints in the early 1970s. For every prime number p (which is suppressed in the notation), it consists of theories K(n) for each nonnegative integer n, each a ring spectrum in the sense of homotopy theory.   Johnson & Wilson (1975) published the first account of the theories.","image":"01876a3adc995f476be7ab37e0257fed602cd8b2.svg","url":"Morava_K-theory"}
