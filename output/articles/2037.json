{"title":"Buchholz psi functions","summary":"Buchholz's psi-functions are a hierarchy of single-argument ordinal functions ψ ν ( α ) {\\displaystyle \\psi _{\\nu }(\\alpha )} introduced by German mathematician Wilfried Buchholz in 1986. These functions are a simplified version of the θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } -functions, but nevertheless have the same strength as those. Later on this approach was extended by Jäger[1] and Schütte.[2]","image":"64ea06da92015017ee78eb13542907603053f809.svg","url":"Buchholz_psi_functions"}
