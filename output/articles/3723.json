{"title":"Càdlàg","summary":"In mathematics, a càdlàg (French: \"continue à droite, limite à gauche\"), RCLL (\"right continuous with left limits\"), or corlol (\"continuous on (the) right, limit on (the) left\") function is a function defined on the real numbers (or a subset of them) that is everywhere right-continuous and has left limits everywhere. Càdlàg functions are important in the study of stochastic processes that admit (or even require) jumps, unlike Brownian motion, which has continuous sample paths. The collection of càdlàg functions on a given domain is known as Skorokhod space.","image":"Discrete_probability_distribution_illustration.png.webp","url":"Càdlàg"}
