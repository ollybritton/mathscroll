{"title":"Dual-phase evolution","summary":"Dual phase evolution (DPE) is a process that drives self-organization within complex adaptive systems.[1] It arises in response to phase changes within the network of connections formed by a system's components. DPE occurs in a wide range of physical, biological and social systems. Its applications to technology include methods for manufacturing novel materials and algorithms to solve complex problems in computation.","image":"f5f7a9843d325596803885da82ff89768d47179f.svg","url":"Dual-phase_evolution"}
