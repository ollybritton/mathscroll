{"title":"Polytopological space","summary":"In general topology, a polytopological space consists of a set X {\\displaystyle X} together with a family { τ i } i ∈ I {\\displaystyle \\{\\tau _{i}\\}_{i\\in I}} of topologies on X {\\displaystyle X} that is linearly ordered by the inclusion relation ( I {\\displaystyle I} is an arbitrary index set). It is usually assumed that the topologies are in non-decreasing order,[1][2] but some authors prefer to put the associated closure operators { k i } i ∈ I {\\displaystyle \\{k_{i}\\}_{i\\in I}} in non-decreasing order (operators k i {\\displaystyle k_{i}} and k j {\\displaystyle k_{j}} satisfy k i ≤ k j {\\displaystyle k_{i}\\leq k_{j}} if and only if k i A ⊆ k j A {\\displaystyle k_{i}A\\subseteq k_{j}A} for all A ⊆ X {\\displaystyle A\\subseteq X} ),[3] in which case the topologies have to be non-increasing.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Polytopological_space"}
