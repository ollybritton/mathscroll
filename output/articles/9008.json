{"title":"Langlands program","summary":"In representation theory and algebraic number theory, the Langlands program is a web of far-reaching and influential conjectures about connections between number theory and geometry. Proposed by Robert LanglandsÂ (1967, 1970), it seeks to relate Galois groups in algebraic number theory to automorphic forms and representation theory of algebraic groups over local fields and adeles. Widely seen as the single biggest project in modern mathematical research, the Langlands program has been described by Edward Frenkel as \"a kind of grand unified theory of mathematics.\"[1]","image":"f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7.svg","url":"Langlands_program"}
