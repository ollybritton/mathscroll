{"title":"Shannon capacity of a graph","summary":"In graph theory, the Shannon capacity of a graph is a graph invariant defined from the number of independent sets of strong graph products. It is named after American mathematician Claude Shannon. It measures the Shannon capacity of a communications channel defined from the graph, and is upper bounded by the Lov√°sz number, which can be computed in polynomial time. However, the computational complexity of the Shannon capacity itself remains unknown.","image":"Cycle_graph_C5.png.webp","url":"Shannon_capacity_of_a_graph"}
