{"title":"Lists of integrals","summary":"Integration is the basic operation in integral calculus.  While differentiation has straightforward rules by which the derivative of a complicated function can be found by differentiating its simpler component functions, integration does not, so tables of known integrals are often useful. This page lists some of the most common antiderivatives.","image":"2e45d8b935713d6a90372cb1d83f9f8c37732b21.svg","url":"Lists_of_integrals"}
