{"title":"Graph-tool","summary":"graph-tool is a Python module for manipulation and statistical analysis of graphs (AKA  networks). The core data structures and algorithms of graph-tool are implemented in C++, making extensive use of metaprogramming, based heavily on the Boost Graph Library.[1] Many algorithms are implemented in parallel using OpenMP, which provides increased performance on multi-core architectures.","image":"Graph-tool-logo.png.webp","url":"Graph-tool"}
