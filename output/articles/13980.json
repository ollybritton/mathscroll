{"title":"Schur-convex function","summary":"In mathematics, a Schur-convex function, also known as S-convex, isotonic function and order-preserving function is a function f : R d → R {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {R} ^{d}\\rightarrow \\mathbb {R} } that for all x , y ∈ R d {\\displaystyle x,y\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{d}} such that x {\\displaystyle x} is majorized by y {\\displaystyle y} , one has that f ( x ) ≤ f ( y ) {\\displaystyle f(x)\\leq f(y)} . Named after Issai Schur, Schur-convex functions are used in the study of majorization. Every function that is convex and symmetric is also Schur-convex.  The opposite implication is not  true, but all Schur-convex functions are symmetric (under permutations of the arguments).[1]","image":"bec50e752fb5265b86114166e6d1f6be5e5d4c75.svg","url":"Schur-convex_function"}
