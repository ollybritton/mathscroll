{"title":"Random variate","summary":"In probability and statistics, a random variate or simply variate is a particular outcome of a random variable: the random variates which are other outcomes of the same random variable might have different values (random numbers). A random deviate or simply deviate is the difference of random variate with respect to the distribution central location (e.g., mean), often divided by the standard deviation of the distribution (i.e., as a standard score).[1]","image":"Merge-arrow.svg.png.webp","url":"Random_variate"}
