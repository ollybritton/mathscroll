{"title":"Presheaf with transfers","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a presheaf with transfers is, roughly, a presheaf that, like cohomology theory, comes with pushforwards, “transfer” maps. Precisely, it is, by definition, a contravariant additive functor from the category of finite correspondences (defined below) to the category of abelian groups (in category theory, “presheaf” is another term for a contravariant functor).","image":"47abf3c7b65ff458c1f9b05751d3022a0d63bd85.svg","url":"Presheaf_with_transfers"}
