{"title":"Dieudonné module","summary":"In mathematics, a Dieudonné module introduced by Jean Dieudonné (1954, 1957b),  is a module over the non-commutative Dieudonné ring, which is generated over the ring of Witt vectors by two special  endomorphisms F {\\displaystyle F} and V {\\displaystyle V} called the Frobenius and Verschiebung operators. They are used for studying finite flat commutative group schemes.","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"Dieudonné_module"}
