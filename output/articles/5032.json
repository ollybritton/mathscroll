{"title":"Euclidean geometry","summary":"Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to  ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry; Elements. Euclid's approach consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms (postulates) and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated earlier,[1] Euclid was the first to organize these propositions into a logical system in which each result is proved from axioms and previously proved theorems.[2]","image":"Sanzio_01_Euclid.jpg.webp","url":"Euclidean_geometry"}
