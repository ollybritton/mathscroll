{"title":"Exponential response formula","summary":"In mathematics, the exponential response formula (ERF), also known as exponential response and complex replacement, is a method used to find a particular solution of a non-homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation of any order.[1][2] The exponential response formula is applicable to non-homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients if the function is polynomial, sinusoidal, exponential or the combination of the three.[2] The general solution of a non-homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation is a superposition of the general solution of the associated homogeneous ODE and a particular solution to the non-homogeneous ODE.[1] Alternative methods for solving ordinary differential equations of higher order are method of undetermined coefficients and method of variation of parameters.","image":"6ef056f54c1b311307f36ee2c26f2741ccb62892.svg","url":"Exponential_response_formula"}
