{"title":"Berlekamp–Van Lint–Seidel graph","summary":"In graph theory, the Berlekamp–Van Lint–Seidel graph is a locally linear strongly regular graph with parameters ( 243 , 22 , 1 , 2 ) {\\displaystyle (243,22,1,2)} . This means that it has 243 vertices, 22 edges per vertex (for a total of 2673 edges), exactly one shared neighbor per pair of adjacent vertices, and exactly two shared neighbors per pair of non-adjacent vertices. It was constructed by Elwyn Berlekamp, J. H. van Lint, and Johan Jacob Seidel as the coset graph of the ternary Golay code.[1]","image":"c8b5dea3936122ade41b7adfe718e893637f969d.svg","url":"Berlekamp–Van_Lint–Seidel_graph"}
