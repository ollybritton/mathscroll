{"title":"Gyrovector space","summary":"A gyrovector space is a mathematical concept proposed by Abraham A. Ungar for studying hyperbolic geometry in analogy to the way vector spaces are used in Euclidean geometry.[1]  Ungar introduced the concept of  gyrovectors that have addition based on gyrogroups instead of vectors which have  addition based on groups.  Ungar developed his concept as a tool for the formulation of special relativity as an alternative to  the use of Lorentz transformations to represent compositions of velocities (also called boosts â€“ \"boosts\" are aspects of relative velocities, and should not be conflated with \"translations\"). This is achieved by introducing \"gyro operators\"; two 3d velocity vectors are used to construct an operator, which acts on another 3d velocity.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Gyrovector_space"}
