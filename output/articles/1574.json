{"title":"Bicentric quadrilateral","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, a bicentric quadrilateral is a convex quadrilateral that has both an incircle and a circumcircle. The radii and center of these circles are called inradius and circumradius, and incenter and circumcenter respectively. From the definition it follows that bicentric quadrilaterals have all the properties of both tangential quadrilaterals and cyclic quadrilaterals. Other names for these quadrilaterals are chord-tangent quadrilateral[1] and inscribed and circumscribed quadrilateral. It has also rarely been called a double circle quadrilateral[2] and double scribed quadrilateral.[3]","image":"Bicentric_quadrilateral_poncelet.svg.png.webp","url":"Bicentric_quadrilateral"}
