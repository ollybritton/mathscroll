{"title":"Algebra of physical space","summary":"In physics, the algebra of physical space (APS) is the use of the Clifford or geometric algebra Cl3,0(R) of the three-dimensional Euclidean space as a model for (3+1)-dimensional spacetime, representing a point in spacetime via a paravector (3-dimensional vector plus a 1-dimensional scalar).","image":"fb429cf8269d8f877a8ec15a44d7efba81354d48.svg","url":"Algebra_of_physical_space"}
