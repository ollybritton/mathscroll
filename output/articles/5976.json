{"title":"Gauss's lemma (Riemannian geometry)","summary":"In Riemannian geometry, Gauss's lemma asserts that any sufficiently small sphere centered at a point in a Riemannian manifold is perpendicular to every geodesic through the point.  More formally, let M be a Riemannian manifold, equipped with its Levi-Civita connection, and p a point of M.  The exponential map is a mapping from the tangent space at p to M:","image":"5f4001dfb1142c053ea17c51b034256bf6b46991.svg","url":"Gauss's_lemma_(Riemannian_geometry)"}
