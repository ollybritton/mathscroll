{"title":"Selection theorem","summary":"In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, a selection theorem is a theorem that guarantees the existence of a single-valued selection function from a given set-valued map. There are various selection theorems, and they are important in the theories of differential inclusions, optimal control, and mathematical economics.[1]","image":"49bd7b7abcd53e61537840e2c2d47dd4895b14ed.svg","url":"Selection_theorem"}
