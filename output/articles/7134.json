{"title":"Hessian equation","summary":"In mathematics, k-Hessian equations (or Hessian equations for short)  are partial differential equations (PDEs) based on the Hessian matrix. More specifically, a Hessian equation is the k-trace, or the kth elementary symmetric polynomial of eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. When k ≥ 2, the k-Hessian equation is a fully nonlinear partial differential equation.[1] It can be written as S k [ u ] = f {\\displaystyle {\\cal {S}}_{k}[u]=f} , where 1 ⩽ k ⩽ n {\\displaystyle 1\\leqslant k\\leqslant n} , S k [ u ] = σ k ( λ ( D 2 u ) ) {\\displaystyle {\\cal {S}}_{k}[u]=\\sigma _{k}(\\lambda ({\\cal {D}}^{2}u))} , and λ ( D 2 u ) = ( λ 1 , ⋯ , λ n ) {\\displaystyle \\lambda ({\\cal {D}}^{2}u)=(\\lambda _{1},\\cdots ,\\lambda _{n})} , are the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix D 2 u = [ ∂ i ∂ j u ] 1 ≤ i , j ≤ n {\\displaystyle {\\cal {D}}^{2}u=[\\partial _{i}\\partial _{j}u]_{1\\leq i,j\\leq n}} and σ k ( λ ) = ∑ i 1 < ⋯ < i k λ i 1 ⋯ λ i k {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{k}(\\lambda )=\\sum _{i_{1}<\\cdots <i_{k}}\\lambda _{i_{1}}\\cdots \\lambda _{i_{k}}} , is a k {\\displaystyle k} th elementary symmetric polynomial.[2][3]","image":"c28baf6e742cfe219485d47abe83de19f2f79ded.svg","url":"Hessian_equation"}
