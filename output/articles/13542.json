{"title":"Riemann mapping theorem","summary":"In complex analysis, the Riemann mapping theorem states that if U {\\displaystyle U} is a non-empty simply connected open subset of the complex number plane C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } which is not all of C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } , then there exists a biholomorphic mapping f {\\displaystyle f} (i.e. a bijective holomorphic mapping whose inverse is also holomorphic) from U {\\displaystyle U} onto the open unit disk","image":"458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025.svg","url":"Riemann_mapping_theorem"}
