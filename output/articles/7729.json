{"title":"Indexed family","summary":"In mathematics, a family, or indexed family, is informally a collection of objects, each associated with an index from some index set. For example, a family of real numbers, indexed by the set of integers is a collection of real numbers, where a given function selects one real number for each integer (possibly the same) as indexing.","image":"535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f.svg","url":"Indexed_family"}
