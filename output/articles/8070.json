{"title":"Isomorphism-closed subcategory","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a subcategory A {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}} of a category B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}} is said to be isomorphism closed or replete if every B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}} -isomorphism h : A → B {\\displaystyle h:A\\to B} with A ∈ A {\\displaystyle A\\in {\\mathcal {A}}} belongs to A . {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}.} This implies that both B {\\displaystyle B} and h − 1 : B → A {\\displaystyle h^{-1}:B\\to A} belong to A {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}} as well.","image":"280ae03440942ab348c2ca9b8db6b56ffa9618f8.svg","url":"Isomorphism-closed_subcategory"}
