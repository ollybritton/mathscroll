{"title":"Algorithmic logic","summary":"Algorithmic logic is a calculus of programs that allows the expression of semantic properties of programs by appropriate logical formulas. It provides a framework that enables proving the formulas from the axioms of program constructs such as assignment, iteration and composition instructions and from the axioms of the data structures in question see Mirkowska & Salwicki (1987), Banachowski et al. (1977).","image":"b9a0144121e0bc509203574f211e1675d9ca1127.svg","url":"Algorithmic_logic"}
