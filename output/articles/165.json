{"title":"Isaac Newton","summary":"Sir Isaac Newton FRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27)[lower-alpha 1] was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher. He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed. His pioneering book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, consolidated many of his previous results and established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.","image":"Portrait_of_Sir_Isaac_Newton%2C_1689.jpg.webp","url":"A%2fIsaac_Newton"}
