{"title":"Great deltoidal icositetrahedron","summary":"In geometry, the great deltoidal icositetrahedron (or great sagittal disdodecahedron) is the dual of the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron. Its faces are darts. Part of each dart lies inside the solid, hence is invisible in solid models.","image":"DU17_great_strombic_icositetrahedron.png.webp","url":"Great_deltoidal_icositetrahedron"}
