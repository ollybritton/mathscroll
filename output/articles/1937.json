{"title":"Branch point","summary":"In the mathematical field of complex analysis, a branch point of a multi-valued function (usually referred to as a \"multifunction\" in the context of complex analysis) is a point such that if the function is n-valued (has n values) at that point, all of its neighborhoods contain a point that has more than n values[1]. Multi-valued functions are rigorously studied using Riemann surfaces, and the formal definition of branch points employs this concept.","image":"8ddc080f4a04a221a2bff8d41ab10782d9d41f34.svg","url":"Branch_point"}
