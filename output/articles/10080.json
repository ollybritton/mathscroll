{"title":"Mathematical model","summary":"A mathematical model is an abstract description of a concrete  system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling. Mathematical models are used in applied mathematics and in the natural sciences (such as physics, biology, earth science, chemistry) and engineering disciplines (such as computer science, electrical engineering), as well as in non-physical systems such as the social sciences[1] (such as economics, psychology, sociology, political science). It can also be taught as a subject in its own right.[2]","image":"Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png.webp","url":"Mathematical_model"}
