{"title":"Quadratic differential","summary":"In mathematics, a quadratic differential on a Riemann surface is a section of the symmetric square of the holomorphic cotangent bundle. If the section is holomorphic, then the quadratic differential is said to be holomorphic. The vector space of holomorphic quadratic differentials on a Riemann surface has a natural interpretation as the cotangent space to the Riemann moduli space, or Teichm√ºller space.","image":"458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025.svg","url":"Quadratic_differential"}
