{"title":"Newton's method in optimization","summary":"In calculus, Newton's method (also called Newton–Raphson) is an iterative method for finding the roots of a differentiable function F, which are solutions to the equation F (x) = 0. As such, Newton's method can be applied to the derivative f ′ of a twice-differentiable function f to find the roots of the derivative (solutions to f ′(x) = 0), also known as the critical points of f. These solutions may be minima, maxima, or saddle points; see section \"Several variables\" in Critical point (mathematics) and also section \"Geometric interpretation\" in this article. This is relevant in optimization, which aims to find (global) minima of the function f.","image":"Newton_optimization_vs_grad_descent.svg.png.webp","url":"Newton's_method_in_optimization"}
