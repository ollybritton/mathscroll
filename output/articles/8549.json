{"title":"KBD algorithm","summary":"The KBD algorithm is a cluster update algorithm designed for the fully frustrated Ising model in two dimensions,[1] or more generally any two dimensional spin glass with frustrated plaquettes arranged in a checkered pattern.[2] It is discovered in 1990 by Daniel Kandel, Radel Ben-Av, and Eytan Domany, and generalized by P. D. Coddington and L. Han in 1994.[3] It is the inspiration for cluster algorithms used in quantum monte carlo simulations.","image":"627997b2e8cec065c03f766ab3ecd5bc2d67fbdb.svg","url":"KBD_algorithm"}
