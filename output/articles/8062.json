{"title":"Isogonal conjugate","summary":"In geometry, the isogonal conjugate of a point P with respect to a triangle △ABC is constructed by reflecting the lines PA, PB, PC about the angle bisectors of A, B, C respectively. These three reflected lines concur at the isogonal conjugate of P.  (This definition applies only to points not on a sideline of triangle △ABC.) This is a direct result of the trigonometric form of Ceva's theorem.","image":"Isogonal_Conjugate.svg.png.webp","url":"Isogonal_conjugate"}
