{"title":"Chan–Karolyi–Longstaff–Sanders process","summary":"In mathematics, the Chan–Karolyi–Longstaff–Sanders process (abbreviated as CKLS process) is a stochastic process with applications to finance. In particular it has been used to model the term structure of interest rates. The CKLS process can also be viewed as a generalization of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. It is named after K. C. Chan, G. Andrew Karolyi, Francis A. Longstaff, and Anthony B. Sanders. They invented the model in a paper published in 1992.[1][2]","image":"82120d04dfb3cbadc4912951dd12b5568c9cd8f3.svg","url":"Chan–Karolyi–Longstaff–Sanders_process"}
