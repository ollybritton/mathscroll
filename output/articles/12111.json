{"title":"Phantom map","summary":"In homotopy theory, phantom maps are continuous maps f : X → Y {\\textstyle f:X\\to Y} of CW-complexes for which the restriction of f {\\textstyle f} to any finite subcomplex Z ⊂ X {\\textstyle Z\\subset X} is inessential (i.e., nullhomotopic). J. Frank Adams and Grant Walker (1964) produced the first known nontrivial example of such a map with Y {\\textstyle Y} finite-dimensional (answering a question of Paul Olum). Shortly thereafter, the terminology of \"phantom map\" was coined by Brayton Gray (1966), who constructed a stably essential phantom map from infinite-dimensional complex projective space to S 3 {\\textstyle S^{3}} .[1] The subject was analysed in the thesis of Gray, much of which was elaborated and later published in (Gray & McGibbon 1993). Similar constructions are defined for maps of spectra.[2]","image":"e09f9f690458ed907b5124064efb66ee6e302d57.svg","url":"Phantom_map"}
