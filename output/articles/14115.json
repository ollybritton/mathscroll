{"title":"Semialgebraic set","summary":"In mathematics, a semialgebraic set is a finite union of sets defined by polynomial equalities and polynomial inequalities. A semialgebraic function is a function with a semialgebraic graph. Such sets and functions are mainly studied in real algebraic geometry which is the appropriate framework for algebraic geometry over the real numbers.","image":"573f72afae7df709959ab1a58cd643743466a187.svg","url":"Semialgebraic_set"}
