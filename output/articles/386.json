{"title":"Adjoint representation","summary":"In mathematics, the adjoint representation (or adjoint action) of a Lie group G is a way of representing the elements of the group as linear transformations of the group's Lie algebra, considered as a vector space. For example, if G is G L ( n , R ) {\\displaystyle GL(n,\\mathbb {R} )} , the Lie group of real n-by-n invertible matrices, then the adjoint representation is the group homomorphism that sends an invertible n-by-n matrix g {\\displaystyle g} to an endomorphism of the vector space of all linear transformations of R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} defined by: x ↦ g x g − 1 {\\displaystyle x\\mapsto gxg^{-1}} .","image":"a1f7197960fac26cadfe027d3045154b9972f8d3.svg","url":"Adjoint_representation"}
