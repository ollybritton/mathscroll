{"title":"Almost","summary":"In set theory, when dealing with sets of infinite size, the term almost or nearly is used to refer to all but a negligible amount of elements in the set. The notion of \"negligible\" depends on the context, and may mean \"of measure zero\" (in a measure space), \"finite\" (when infinite sets are involved), or \"countable\" (when uncountably infinite sets are involved).","image":"33f9fde06966a7b1b003cfff80d57ddde1fc8587.svg","url":"Almost"}
