{"title":"Gyárfás–Sumner conjecture","summary":"In graph theory, the Gyárfás–Sumner conjecture asks whether, for every tree T {\\displaystyle T} and complete graph K {\\displaystyle K} , the graphs with neither T {\\displaystyle T} nor K {\\displaystyle K} as induced subgraphs can be properly colored using only a constant number of colors. Equivalently, it asks whether the T {\\displaystyle T} -free graphs are χ {\\displaystyle \\chi } -bounded.[1] It is named after András Gyárfás and David Sumner, who formulated it independently in 1975 and 1981 respectively.[2][3] It remains unproven.[4]","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Gyárfás–Sumner_conjecture"}
