{"title":"Tournament solution","summary":"A tournament solution is a function that maps an oriented complete graph to a nonempty subset of its vertices. It can informally be thought of as a way to find the \"best\" alternatives among all of the alternatives that are \"competing\" against each other in the tournament. Tournament solutions originate from social choice theory,[1][2][3][4] but have also been considered in sports competition, game theory,[5] multi-criteria decision analysis, biology,[6][7] webpage ranking,[8] and dueling bandit problems.[9]","image":"A_coloured_voting_box_(no_bg).svg.png.webp","url":"Tournament_solution"}
