{"title":"Sieve (category theory)","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a sieve is a way of choosing arrows with a common codomain.  It is a categorical analogue of a collection of open subsets of a fixed open set in topology.  In a Grothendieck topology, certain sieves become categorical analogues of open covers in topology. Sieves were introduced by Giraud (1964) in order to reformulate the notion of a Grothendieck topology.","image":"a052b6e720991de103b96a62c981d36da8ffffbe.svg","url":"Sieve_(category_theory)"}
