{"title":"Stable principal bundle","summary":"In mathematics, and especially differential geometry and algebraic geometry, a stable principal bundle is a generalisation of the notion of a stable vector bundle to the setting of principal bundles. The concept of stability for principal bundles was introduced by Annamalai Ramanathan for the purpose of defining the moduli space of G-principal bundles over a Riemann surface, a generalisation of earlier work by David Mumford and others on the moduli spaces of vector bundles.[1][2][3]","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Stable_principal_bundle"}
