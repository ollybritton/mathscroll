{"title":"Uniform polyhedron compound","summary":"In geometry, a uniform polyhedron compound is a polyhedral compound whose constituents are identical (although possibly enantiomorphous) uniform polyhedra, in an arrangement that is also uniform, i.e. the symmetry group of the compound acts transitively on the compound's vertices.","image":"UC01-6_tetrahedra.png.webp","url":"Uniform_polyhedron_compound"}
