{"title":"f-divergence","summary":"In probability theory, an f {\\displaystyle f} -divergence is a function D f ( P â€– Q ) {\\displaystyle D_{f}(P\\|Q)} that measures the difference between two probability distributions P {\\displaystyle P} and Q {\\displaystyle Q} . Many common divergences, such as KL-divergence, Hellinger distance, and total variation distance, are special cases of f {\\displaystyle f} -divergence.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"F-divergence"}
