{"title":"Structural complexity theory","summary":"In computational complexity theory of computer science, the structural complexity theory or simply structural complexity is the study of complexity classes, rather than computational complexity of individual problems and algorithms. It involves the research of both internal structures of various complexity classes and the relations between different complexity classes.[1]","image":"Polynomial_time_hierarchy.svg.png.webp","url":"Structural_complexity_theory"}
