{"title":"Reachability","summary":"In graph theory, reachability refers to the ability to get from one vertex to another within a graph. A vertex s {\\displaystyle s} can reach a vertex t {\\displaystyle t} (and t {\\displaystyle t} is reachable from s {\\displaystyle s} ) if there exists a sequence of adjacent vertices (i.e. a walk) which starts with s {\\displaystyle s} and ends with t {\\displaystyle t} .","image":"01d131dfd7673938b947072a13a9744fe997e632.svg","url":"Reachability"}
