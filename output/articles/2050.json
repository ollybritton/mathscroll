{"title":"Bundle (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a bundle is a generalization of a fiber bundle dropping the condition of a local product structure. The requirement of a local product structure rests on the bundle having a topology. Without this requirement, more general objects can be considered bundles. For example, one can consider a bundle π: E→ B with E and B sets. It is no longer true that the preimages π − 1 ( x ) {\\displaystyle \\pi ^{-1}(x)} must all look alike, unlike fiber bundles where the fibers must all be isomorphic (in the case of vector bundles) and homeomorphic.","image":"daf34d317cf7644f28ce31b4af747261f1a62000.svg","url":"Bundle_(mathematics)"}
