{"title":"MAXEkSAT","summary":"MAXEkSAT is a problem in computational complexity theory that is a maximization version of the Boolean satisfiability problem 3SAT. In MAXEkSAT, each clause has exactly k literals, each with distinct variables, and is in conjunctive normal form. These are called k-CNF formulas. The problem is to determine the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied by a truth assignment to the variables in the clauses.","image":"e108a391eb6f85f39550874d2819c0f3b4dc702d.svg","url":"MAXEkSAT"}
