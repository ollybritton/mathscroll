{"title":"Implication graph","summary":"In mathematical logic and graph theory, an implication graph is a skew-symmetric, directed graph G = (V, E) composed of vertex set V and directed edge set E. Each vertex in V represents the truth status of a Boolean literal, and each directed edge from vertex u to vertex v represents the material implication \"If the literal u is true then the literal v is also true\". Implication graphs were originally used for analyzing complex Boolean expressions.","image":"Implication_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Implication_graph"}
