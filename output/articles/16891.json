{"title":"Whitney extension theorem","summary":"In mathematics, in particular in mathematical analysis, the Whitney extension theorem is a partial converse to Taylor's theorem.  Roughly speaking, the theorem asserts that if A is a closed subset of a Euclidean space, then it is possible to extend a given function of A in such a way as to have prescribed derivatives at the points of A. It is a result of Hassler Whitney.","image":"313c4e64f54b1b60a0927915de76204c01098c33.svg","url":"Whitney_extension_theorem"}
