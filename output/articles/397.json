{"title":"Adomian decomposition method","summary":"The Adomian decomposition method (ADM) is a semi-analytical method for solving ordinary and partial nonlinear differential equations.  The method was developed from the 1970s to the 1990s by George Adomian, chair of the Center for Applied Mathematics at the University of Georgia.[1] It is further extensible to stochastic systems by using the Ito integral.[2] The aim of this method is towards a unified theory for the solution of partial differential equations (PDE); an aim which has been superseded by the more general theory of the homotopy analysis method.[3] The crucial aspect of the method is employment of the \"Adomian polynomials\" which allow for solution convergence of the nonlinear portion of the equation, without simply linearizing the system.  These polynomials mathematically generalize to a Maclaurin series about an arbitrary external parameter; which gives the solution method more flexibility than direct Taylor series expansion.[4]","image":"85ba141f50c288a7f7d04548be36e27a87bffdfa.svg","url":"Adomian_decomposition_method"}
