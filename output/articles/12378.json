{"title":"Pontryagin product","summary":"In mathematics, the Pontryagin product, introduced by Lev PontryaginÂ (1939), is a product on the homology of a topological space induced by a product on the topological space. Special cases include the Pontryagin product on the homology of an abelian group, the Pontryagin product on an H-space, and the Pontryagin product on a loop space.","image":"e3f17c03960218619c81cf18f8731d3e1573c3e0.svg","url":"Pontryagin_product"}
