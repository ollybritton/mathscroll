{"title":"Direct limit of groups","summary":"In mathematics, a direct limit of groups is the direct limit of a direct system of groups. These are central objects of study in algebraic topology, especially stable homotopy theory and homological algebra. They are sometimes called stable groups, though this term normally means something quite different in model theory.","image":"0edbece5a7090a9c5aa9463cec42ad54a1448a51.svg","url":"Direct_limit_of_groups"}
