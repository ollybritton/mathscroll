{"title":"Todd class","summary":"In mathematics, the Todd class is a certain construction now considered a part of the theory in algebraic topology of characteristic classes.  The Todd class of a vector bundle can be defined by means of the theory of Chern classes, and is encountered where Chern classes exist â€” most notably in differential topology, the theory of complex manifolds and algebraic geometry. In rough terms, a Todd class acts like a reciprocal of a Chern class, or stands in relation to it as a conormal bundle does to a normal bundle.","image":"1212a1856162a08ab6e3247f28461b4344dee55f.svg","url":"Todd_class"}
