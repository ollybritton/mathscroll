{"title":"Asymptotic distribution","summary":"In mathematics and statistics, an asymptotic distribution is a probability distribution that is in a sense the \"limiting\" distribution of a sequence of distributions. One of the main uses of the idea of an asymptotic distribution is in providing approximations to the cumulative distribution functions of statistical estimators.","image":"fc2ef31340dad0c9e4594524f490aa63c2a29714.svg","url":"Asymptotic_distribution"}
