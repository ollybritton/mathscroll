{"title":"Reeve tetrahedra","summary":"In geometry, the Reeve tetrahedra are a family of polyhedra in three-dimensional space with vertices at (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0) and (1, 1, r) where r is a positive integer. They are named after John Reeve, who in 1957 used them to show that higher-dimensional generalizations of Pick's theorem do not exist.[1]","image":"Reeve_tetrahedrons.svg.png.webp","url":"Reeve_tetrahedra"}
