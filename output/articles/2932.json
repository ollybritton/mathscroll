{"title":"Compact-open topology","summary":"In mathematics, the compact-open topology is a topology defined on the set of continuous maps between two topological spaces. The compact-open topology is one of the commonly used topologies on function spaces, and is applied in homotopy theory and functional analysis.  It was introduced by Ralph Fox in 1945.[1]","image":"0a85e35a983b9acfd3f3f0e524e257d7d0e66b7d.svg","url":"Compact-open_topology"}
