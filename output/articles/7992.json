{"title":"Inverse distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, an inverse distribution is the distribution of the reciprocal of a random variable. Inverse distributions arise in particular in the Bayesian context of prior distributions and posterior distributions for scale parameters. In the algebra of random variables, inverse distributions are special cases of the class of ratio distributions, in which the numerator random variable has a degenerate distribution.","image":"f306cd973763b81cb5b9731cd4e00051d8b7c571.svg","url":"Inverse_distribution"}
