{"title":"Icosahedral symmetry","summary":"In mathematics, and especially in geometry, an object has icosahedral symmetry if it has the same symmetries as a regular icosahedron. Examples of other polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry include the regular dodecahedron (the dual of the icosahedron) and the rhombic triacontahedron.","image":"Sphere_symmetry_group_cs.png.webp","url":"Icosahedral_symmetry"}
