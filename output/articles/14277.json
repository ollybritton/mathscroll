{"title":"Shearlet","summary":"In applied mathematical analysis, shearlets are a multiscale framework which allows efficient encoding of anisotropic features in multivariate problem classes. Originally, shearlets were introduced in 2006[1] for the analysis and sparse approximation of functions f âˆˆ L 2 ( R 2 ) {\\displaystyle f\\in L^{2}(\\mathbb {R} ^{2})} . They are a natural extension of wavelets, to accommodate the fact that multivariate functions are typically governed by anisotropic features such as edges in images, since wavelets, as isotropic objects, are not capable of capturing such phenomena.","image":"c10644851f423b3d82008df3266b782f6fc247ba.svg","url":"Shearlet"}
