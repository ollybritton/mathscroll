{"title":"Langlands–Shahidi method","summary":"In mathematics, the Langlands–Shahidi method provides the means to define automorphic L-functions in many cases that arise with connected reductive groups over a number field. This includes Rankin–Selberg products for cuspidal automorphic representations of general linear groups. The method develops the theory of the local coefficient, which links to the global theory via Eisenstein series. The resulting L-functions satisfy a number of analytic properties, including an important functional equation.","image":"ec48516f73353b7b2ccdb5e2baa2aafde4773904.svg","url":"Langlands–Shahidi_method"}
