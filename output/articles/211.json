{"title":"APX","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the class APX (an abbreviation of \"approximable\") is the set of NP optimization problems that allow polynomial-time approximation algorithms with approximation ratio bounded by a constant (or constant-factor approximation algorithms for short). In simple terms, problems in this class have efficient algorithms that can find an answer within some fixed multiplicative factor of the optimal answer.","image":"c1c49fad1eccc4e9af1e4f23f32efdc3ac4da973.svg","url":"APX"}
