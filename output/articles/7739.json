{"title":"Induced metric","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical physics, the induced metric is the metric tensor defined on a submanifold that is induced from the metric tensor on a manifold into which the submanifold is embedded, through the pullback.[1] It may be determined using the following formula (using the Einstein summation convention), which is the component form of the pullback operation:[2]","image":"5a2f80b5bf5d02c886ef2b1843fc3a067f91ff65.svg","url":"Induced_metric"}
