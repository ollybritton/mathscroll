{"title":"Position and momentum spaces","summary":"In physics and geometry, there are two closely related vector spaces, usually three-dimensional but in general of any finite dimension. Position space (also real space or coordinate space) is the set of all position vectors r in space, and has dimensions of length; a position vector defines a point in space. (If the position vector of a point particle varies with time, it will trace out a path, the trajectory of a particle.) Momentum space is the set of all momentum vectors p a physical system can have; the momentum vector of a particle corresponds to its motion, with units of [mass][length][time]âˆ’1.","image":"ffbf075f7d7041a41bc0ab5f09cec263459debe2.svg","url":"Position_and_momentum_spaces"}
