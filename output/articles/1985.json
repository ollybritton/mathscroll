{"title":"Brill–Noether theory","summary":"In algebraic geometry, Brill–Noether theory, introduced by Alexander von Brill and Max Noether (1874), is the study of special divisors, certain divisors on a curve C that determine more compatible functions than would be predicted. In classical language, special divisors move on the curve in a \"larger than expected\" linear system of divisors.","image":"49a2305166ceb04a0a646e209fc1925c4fcc31be.svg","url":"Brill–Noether_theory"}
