{"title":"Buckingham π theorem","summary":"In engineering, applied mathematics, and physics, the Buckingham π theorem is a key theorem in dimensional analysis.  It is a formalization of Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis. Loosely, the theorem states that if there is a physically meaningful equation involving a certain number n of physical variables, then the original equation can be rewritten in terms of a set of p = n − k dimensionless parameters π1, π2, ..., πp constructed from the original variables, where k is the number of physical dimensions involved; it is obtained as the rank of a particular matrix.","image":"Edgar_Buckingham_by_Pach_Brothers_c1886.jpg.webp","url":"Buckingham_π_theorem"}
