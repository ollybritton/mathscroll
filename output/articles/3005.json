{"title":"Complex cobordism","summary":"In mathematics, complex cobordism is a generalized cohomology theory related to cobordism of manifolds. Its spectrum is denoted by MU. It is an exceptionally powerful cohomology theory, but can be quite hard to compute, so often instead of using it directly one uses some slightly weaker theories derived from it, such as Brownâ€“Peterson cohomology or Morava K-theory, that are easier to compute.","image":"06b4cecc20d35cf26510b5aa7dd53bd96d902749.svg","url":"Complex_cobordism"}
