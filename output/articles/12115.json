{"title":"Phase-type distribution","summary":"A phase-type distribution is a probability distribution constructed by a convolution or mixture of exponential distributions.[1] It results from a system of one or more inter-related Poisson processes occurring in sequence, or phases. The sequence in which each of the phases occurs may itself be a stochastic process. The distribution can be represented by a random variable describing the time until absorption of a Markov process with one absorbing state. Each of the states of the Markov process represents one of the phases.","image":"698013ac6c5b8edda3a4053e3d185732d89363b0.svg","url":"Phase-type_distribution"}
