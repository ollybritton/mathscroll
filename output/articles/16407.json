{"title":"Unit tangent bundle","summary":"In Riemannian geometry, the unit tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold (M, g), denoted by T1M, UT(M) or simply UTM, is the unit sphere bundle for the tangent bundle T(M). It is a fiber bundle over M whose fiber at each point is the unit sphere in the tangent bundle:","image":"92d097f3e97e3e92a35359beba254df638406c23.svg","url":"Unit_tangent_bundle"}
