{"title":"Ultrafilter (set theory)","summary":"In the mathematical field of set theory, an ultrafilter is a maximal proper filter: it is a filter U {\\displaystyle U} on a given non-empty set X {\\displaystyle X} which is a certain type of non-empty family of subsets of X , {\\displaystyle X,} that is not equal to the power set â„˜ ( X ) {\\displaystyle \\wp (X)} of X {\\displaystyle X} (such filters are called proper) and that is also \"maximal\" in that there does not exist any other proper filter on X {\\displaystyle X} that contains it as a proper subset. Said differently, a proper filter U {\\displaystyle U} is called an ultrafilter if there exists exactly one proper filter that contains it as a subset, that proper filter (necessarily) being U {\\displaystyle U} itself.","image":"458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025.svg","url":"Ultrafilter_(set_theory)"}
