{"title":"Chaotic mixing","summary":"In chaos theory and fluid dynamics, chaotic mixing is a process by which flow tracers develop into complex fractals under the action of a fluid flow. The flow is characterized by an exponential growth of fluid filaments.[1][2] Even very simple flows, such as the blinking vortex, or finitely resolved wind fields can generate exceptionally complex patterns from initially simple tracer fields.[3]","image":"Chaotic_mixing.png.webp","url":"Chaotic_mixing"}
