{"title":"Alternating permutation","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, an alternating permutation (or zigzag permutation) of the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n} is a permutation (arrangement) of those numbers so that each entry is alternately greater or less than the preceding entry.  For example, the five alternating permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4} are:","image":"Bernoulli-zigzag.jpg.webp","url":"Alternating_permutation"}
