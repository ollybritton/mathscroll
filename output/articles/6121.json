{"title":"Geodesic curvature","summary":"In Riemannian geometry, the geodesic curvature k g {\\displaystyle k_{g}} of a curve γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } measures how far the curve is from being a geodesic. For example, for 1D curves on a 2D surface embedded in 3D space, it is the curvature of the curve projected onto the surface's tangent plane. More generally, in a given manifold M ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\bar {M}}} , the geodesic curvature is just the usual curvature of γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } (see below). However, when the curve γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } is restricted to lie on a submanifold M {\\displaystyle M} of M ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\bar {M}}} (e.g. for curves on surfaces), geodesic curvature refers to the curvature of γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } in M {\\displaystyle M} and it is different in general from the curvature of γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } in the ambient manifold M ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\bar {M}}} . The (ambient) curvature k {\\displaystyle k} of γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } depends on two factors: the curvature of the submanifold M {\\displaystyle M} in the direction of γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } (the normal curvature k n {\\displaystyle k_{n}} ), which depends only on the direction of the curve, and the curvature of γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } seen in M {\\displaystyle M} (the geodesic curvature k g {\\displaystyle k_{g}} ), which is a second order quantity. The relation between these is k = k g 2 + k n 2 {\\displaystyle k={\\sqrt {k_{g}^{2}+k_{n}^{2}}}} . In particular geodesics on M {\\displaystyle M} have zero geodesic curvature (they are \"straight\"), so that k = k n {\\displaystyle k=k_{n}} , which explains why they appear to be curved in ambient space whenever the submanifold is.","image":"cb19f8a2620a8c782b2c4d20decb0bdc20ff582b.svg","url":"Geodesic_curvature"}
