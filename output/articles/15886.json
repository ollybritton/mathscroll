{"title":"Toroidal embedding","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a toroidal embedding is an open embedding of algebraic varieties that locally looks like the embedding of the open torus into a toric variety. The notion was introduced by Mumford to prove the existence of semistable reductions of algebraic varieties over one-dimensional bases.","image":"83e3cf8c15b3115d4181670927cf62feda9f1199.svg","url":"Toroidal_embedding"}
