{"title":"Domain (ring theory)","summary":"In algebra, a domain is a nonzero ring in which ab = 0 implies a = 0 or b = 0.[1] (Sometimes such a ring is said to \"have the zero-product property\".) Equivalently, a domain is a ring in which 0 is the only left zero divisor (or equivalently, the only right zero divisor).   A commutative domain is called an integral domain.[1][2]  Mathematical literature contains multiple variants of the definition of \"domain\".[3]","image":"a1e84bc3701b5f3f6b222f2323369c81541690d9.svg","url":"Domain_(ring_theory)"}
