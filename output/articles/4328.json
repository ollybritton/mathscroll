{"title":"Divided domain","summary":"In algebra, a divided domain is an integral domain R in which every prime ideal p {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {p}}} satisfies p = p R p {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {p}}={\\mathfrak {p}}R_{\\mathfrak {p}}} .  A locally divided domain is an integral domain that is a divided domain at every maximal ideal.  A Pr√ºfer domain is a basic example of a locally divided domain.[1] Divided domains were introduced by Akiba (1967) who called them AV-domains.","image":"a14c125cdf81ac25d76edc2e8d557302c9f555a9.svg","url":"Divided_domain"}
