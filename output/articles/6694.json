{"title":"Gyroelongated pentagonal cupolarotunda","summary":"In geometry, the gyroelongated pentagonal cupolarotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J47). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a pentagonal cupolarotunda (J32 or J33) by inserting a decagonal antiprism between its two halves.","image":"Gyroelongated_pentagonal_cupolarotunda.png.webp","url":"Gyroelongated_pentagonal_cupolarotunda"}
