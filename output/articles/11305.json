{"title":"Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem","summary":"The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem is a theorem in the field of signal processing which serves as a fundamental bridge between continuous-time signals and discrete-time signals. It establishes a sufficient condition for a sample rate that permits a discrete sequence of samples to capture all the information from a continuous-time signal of finite bandwidth.","image":"Bandlimited.svg.png.webp","url":"Nyquist–Shannon_sampling_theorem"}
