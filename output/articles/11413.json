{"title":"Ono's inequality","summary":"In mathematics, Ono's inequality is a theorem about triangles in the Euclidean plane. In its original form, as conjectured by T. Ono in 1914, the inequality is actually false; however, the statement is true for acute triangles and right triangles, as shown by F. Balitrand in 1916.","image":"d5bddecda60f896ee9b84d31b7ee598a799bc650.svg","url":"Ono's_inequality"}
