{"title":"Seven-dimensional cross product","summary":"In mathematics, the seven-dimensional cross product is a bilinear operation on vectors in seven-dimensional Euclidean space. It assigns to any two vectors a, b in R 7 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{7}} a vector a × b also in R 7 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{7}} .[1] Like the cross product in three dimensions, the seven-dimensional product is anticommutative and a × b is orthogonal both to a and to b. Unlike in three dimensions, it does not satisfy the Jacobi identity, and while the three-dimensional cross product is unique up to a sign, there are many seven-dimensional cross products. The seven-dimensional cross product has the same relationship to the octonions as the three-dimensional product does to the quaternions.","image":"8dac9ccdfc8ccae77dc08893e1543662098a7a83.svg","url":"Seven-dimensional_cross_product"}
