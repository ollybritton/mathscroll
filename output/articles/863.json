{"title":"Antiderivative (complex analysis)","summary":"In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, the antiderivative, or primitive, of a complex-valued function g is a function whose complex derivative is g. More precisely, given an open set U {\\displaystyle U} in the complex plane and a function g : U → C , {\\displaystyle g:U\\to \\mathbb {C} ,} the antiderivative of g {\\displaystyle g} is a function f : U → C {\\displaystyle f:U\\to \\mathbb {C} } that satisfies d f d z = g {\\displaystyle {\\frac {df}{dz}}=g} .","image":"458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025.svg","url":"Antiderivative_(complex_analysis)"}
