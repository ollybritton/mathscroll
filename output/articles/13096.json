{"title":"Random regular graph","summary":"A random r-regular graph is a graph selected from G n , r {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {G}}_{n,r}} , which denotes the probability space of all r-regular graphs on n {\\displaystyle n} vertices, where 3 â‰¤ r < n {\\displaystyle 3\\leq r<n} and n r {\\displaystyle nr} is even.[1]  It is therefore a particular kind of random graph, but the regularity restriction significantly alters the properties that will hold, since most graphs are not regular.","image":"d731703384b1dd990072d6a20f72ebd6076603fe.svg","url":"Random_regular_graph"}
