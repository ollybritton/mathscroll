{"title":"Vitali convergence theorem","summary":"In real analysis and measure theory, the Vitali convergence theorem, named after the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Vitali, is a generalization of the better-known dominated convergence theorem of Henri Lebesgue. It is a characterization of the convergence in Lp in terms of convergence in measure and a condition related to uniform integrability.","image":"d634d210e57700027029694595ffea10410bf0d5.svg","url":"Vitali_convergence_theorem"}
