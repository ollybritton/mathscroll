{"title":"Selberg trace formula","summary":"In mathematics, the Selberg trace formula, introduced by  Selberg (1956), is an expression for the character of the unitary representation of a Lie group G on the space L2(Γ\\G) of square-integrable functions, where Γ is a cofinite discrete group. The character is given by the trace of certain functions on G.","image":"48891b944fbfd96ddcad38f786462913004017de.svg","url":"Selberg_trace_formula"}
