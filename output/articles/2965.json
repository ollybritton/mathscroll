{"title":"Complementary event","summary":"In probability theory, the complement of any event A is the event [not A], i.e. the event that A does not occur.[1]  The event A and its complement [not A] are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Generally, there is only one event B such that A and B are both mutually exclusive and exhaustive; that event is the complement of A.  The complement of an event A is usually denoted as A′, Ac, ¬ {\\displaystyle \\neg } A or A. Given an event, the event and its complementary event define a Bernoulli trial: did the event occur or not?","image":"fa78fd02085d39aa58c9e47a6d4033ce41e02fad.svg","url":"Complementary_event"}
