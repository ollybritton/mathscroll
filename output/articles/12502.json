{"title":"Primitive permutation group","summary":"In mathematics, a permutation group G acting on a non-empty finite set X is called primitive if G acts transitively on X and the only partitions the G-action preserves are the trivial partitions into either a single set or into |X| singleton sets. Otherwise, if G is transitive and G does preserve a nontrivial partition, G is called imprimitive.","image":"bc7d8799913b9dd4aeb920e71ef64b35cc1b600e.svg","url":"Primitive_permutation_group"}
