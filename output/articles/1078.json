{"title":"Associated prime","summary":"In abstract algebra, an associated prime of a module M over a ring R is a type of prime ideal of R that arises as an annihilator of a (prime) submodule of M.  The set of associated primes is usually denoted by Ass R ‚Å° ( M ) , {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Ass} _{R}(M),} and sometimes called the assassin or assassinator of M (word play between the notation and the fact that an  associated prime is an annihilator).[1]","image":"4b576eab5f6dbf88ed3852d09311e1a2abbdc715.svg","url":"Associated_prime"}
