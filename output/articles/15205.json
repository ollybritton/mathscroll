{"title":"Subquotient","summary":"In the mathematical fields of category theory and abstract algebra, a subquotient is a quotient object of a subobject. Subquotients are particularly important in abelian categories, and in group theory, where they are also known as sections, though this conflicts with a different meaning in category theory.","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Subquotient"}
