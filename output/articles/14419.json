{"title":"Simplicial volume","summary":"In the mathematical field of geometric topology, the simplicial volume (also called Gromov norm) is a certain measure of the topological complexity of a manifold. More generally, the simplicial norm measures the complexity of homology classes.","image":"Lock-green.svg.png.webp","url":"Simplicial_volume"}
