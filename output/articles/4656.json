{"title":"Eguchi–Hanson space","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical physics, the Eguchi–Hanson space is a non-compact, self-dual, asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) metric on the cotangent bundle of the 2-sphere T*S2. The holonomy group of this 4-real-dimensional manifold is SU(2). The metric is generally attributed to the physicists Tohru Eguchi and Andrew J. Hanson; it was discovered independently by the mathematician Eugenio Calabi around the same time in 1979.[1][2]","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Eguchi–Hanson_space"}
