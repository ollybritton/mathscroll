{"title":"Hamming graph","summary":"Hamming graphs are a special class of graphs named after Richard Hamming and used in several branches of mathematics (graph theory) and computer science.  Let S be a set of q elements and d a positive integer.  The Hamming graph H(d,q) has vertex set Sd, the set of ordered d-tuples of elements of S, or sequences of length d from S.  Two vertices are adjacent if they differ in precisely one coordinate; that is, if their Hamming distance is one. The Hamming graph H(d,q) is, equivalently, the Cartesian product of d complete graphs Kq.[1]","image":"6626b66cd04dae7da7d82a9d1457f4b383c6f0e0.svg","url":"Hamming_graph"}
