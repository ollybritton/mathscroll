{"title":"Uniform convergence","summary":"In the mathematical field of analysis, uniform convergence is a mode of convergence of functions stronger than pointwise convergence. A sequence of functions ( f n ) {\\displaystyle (f_{n})} converges uniformly to a limiting function f {\\displaystyle f} on a set E {\\displaystyle E} if, given any arbitrarily small positive number ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } , a number N {\\displaystyle N} can be found such that each of the functions f N , f N + 1 , f N + 2 , … {\\displaystyle f_{N},f_{N+1},f_{N+2},\\ldots } differs from f {\\displaystyle f} by no more than ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } at every point x {\\displaystyle x} in E {\\displaystyle E} .  Described in an informal way, if f n {\\displaystyle f_{n}} converges to f {\\displaystyle f} uniformly, then the rate at which f n ( x ) {\\displaystyle f_{n}(x)} approaches f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} is \"uniform\" throughout its domain in the following sense: in order to guarantee that f n ( x ) {\\displaystyle f_{n}(x)} falls within a certain distance ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } of f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} , we do not need to know the value of x ∈ E {\\displaystyle x\\in E} in question — there can be found a single value of N = N ( ϵ ) {\\displaystyle N=N(\\epsilon )} independent of x {\\displaystyle x} , such that choosing n ≥ N {\\displaystyle n\\geq N} will ensure that f n ( x ) {\\displaystyle f_{n}(x)} is within ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } of f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} for all x ∈ E {\\displaystyle x\\in E} .  In contrast, pointwise convergence of f n {\\displaystyle f_{n}} to f {\\displaystyle f} merely guarantees that for any x ∈ E {\\displaystyle x\\in E} given in advance, we can find N = N ( ϵ , x ) {\\displaystyle N=N(\\epsilon ,x)} ( N {\\displaystyle N} can depend on the value of x {\\displaystyle x} ) so that, for that particular x {\\displaystyle x} , f n ( x ) {\\displaystyle f_{n}(x)} falls within ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } of f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} whenever n ≥ N {\\displaystyle n\\geq N} .","image":"a32c571f35fd41f5ef78fecc130ac39cd2108c8c.svg","url":"Uniform_convergence"}
