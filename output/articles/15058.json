{"title":"Stick number","summary":"In the mathematical theory of knots, the stick number is a knot invariant that intuitively gives the smallest number of straight \"sticks\" stuck end to end needed to form a knot. Specifically, given any knot K {\\displaystyle K} , the stick number of K {\\displaystyle K} , denoted by stick ‚Å° ( K ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {stick} (K)} , is the smallest number of edges of a polygonal path equivalent to K {\\displaystyle K} .","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Stick_number"}
