{"title":"Probability","summary":"In science, the probability of an event is a number that indicates how likely the event is to occur. It is expressed as a number in the range from 0 and 1, or, using percentage notation, in the range from 0% to 100%.  The more likely it is that the event will occur, the higher its probability. The probability of an impossible event is 0; that of an event that is certain to occur is 1.[note 1][1][2] The probabilities of two complementary events A and B – either A occurs or B occurs – add up to 1. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. If a coin is fair, the two possible outcomes (\"heads\" and \"tails\") are equally likely; since these two outcomes are complementary and the probability of \"heads\" equals the probability of \"tails\", the probability of each of the two outcomes equals 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).","image":"N-randompage.svg.png.webp","url":"A%2fProbability"}
