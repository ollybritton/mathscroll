{"title":"Randomized algorithms as zero-sum games","summary":"Randomized algorithms are algorithms that employ a degree of randomness as part of their logic. These algorithms can be used to give good average-case results (complexity-wise) to problems which are hard to solve deterministically, or display poor worst-case complexity. An algorithmic game theoretic approach can help explain why in the average case randomized algorithms may work better than deterministic algorithms.","image":"e5d916774c2e3aa743232053c979faba86c5226c.svg","url":"Randomized_algorithms_as_zero-sum_games"}
