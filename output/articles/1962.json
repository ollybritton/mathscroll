{"title":"Breather surface","summary":"In differential geometry, a breather surface is a one-parameter family of mathematical surfaces which correspond to breather solutions[1] of the sine-Gordon equation, a differential equation appearing in theoretical physics. The surfaces have the remarkable property that they have constant curvature âˆ’ 1 {\\displaystyle -1} , where the curvature is well-defined. This makes them examples of generalized pseudospheres.","image":"704fb0427140d054dd267925495e78164fee9aac.svg","url":"Breather_surface"}
