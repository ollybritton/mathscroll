{"title":"Trace operator","summary":"In mathematics, the trace operator extends the notion of the restriction of a function to the boundary of its domain to \"generalized\" functions in a Sobolev space. This is particularly important for the study of partial differential equations with prescribed boundary conditions (boundary value problems), where weak solutions may not be regular enough to satisfy the boundary conditions in the classical sense of functions.","image":"Trace_operator_illustration.png.webp","url":"Trace_operator"}
