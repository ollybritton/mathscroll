{"title":"Conservative extension","summary":"In mathematical logic, a conservative extension is a supertheory of a theory which is often convenient for proving theorems, but proves no new theorems about the language of the original theory. Similarly, a non-conservative extension is a supertheory which is not conservative, and can prove more theorems than the original.","image":"d1ba5f12fbb0ff766aec6e22148b429373608555.svg","url":"Conservative_extension"}
