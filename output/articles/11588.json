{"title":"Orthocentric tetrahedron","summary":"In geometry, an orthocentric tetrahedron is a tetrahedron where all three pairs of opposite edges are perpendicular. It is also known as an orthogonal tetrahedron since orthogonal means perpendicular. It was first studied by Simon Lhuilier in 1782, and got the name orthocentric tetrahedron by G. de Longchamps in 1890.[1]","image":"527ecf4ac8e4c4aee3ed61ec0a5a748031a906b2.svg","url":"Orthocentric_tetrahedron"}
