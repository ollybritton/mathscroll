{"title":"Hurwitz polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, a Hurwitz polynomial, named after Adolf Hurwitz, is a polynomial  whose roots (zeros) are located in the left half-plane of the complex plane or on the imaginary axis, that is, the real part of every root is zero or negative.[1]  Such a polynomial must have coefficients that are positive real numbers. The term is sometimes restricted to polynomials whose roots have real parts that are strictly negative, excluding the imaginary axis (i.e., a Hurwitz stable polynomial).[2][3]","image":"62c2f43ea285012176c66275fe0a0e0d9ac97f82.svg","url":"Hurwitz_polynomial"}
