{"title":"q-analog","summary":"In mathematics, a q-analog of a theorem, identity or expression is a generalization involving a new parameter q that returns the original theorem, identity or expression in the limit as q â†’ 1.  Typically, mathematicians are interested in q-analogs that arise naturally, rather than in arbitrarily contriving q-analogs of known results.  The earliest q-analog studied in detail is the basic hypergeometric series, which was introduced in the 19th century.[1]","image":"1479ae2de6bc15f3298e1aecfc5d0a36c2a497f1.svg","url":"Q-analog"}
