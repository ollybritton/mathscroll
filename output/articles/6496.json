{"title":"Grassmannian","summary":"In mathematics, the Grassmannian Gr(k, V) is a space that parameterizes all k-dimensional linear subspaces of the n-dimensional vector space V. For example, the Grassmannian Gr(1, V) is the space of lines through the origin in V, so it is the same as the projective space of one dimension lower than V.[1][2]","image":"2b970f05e9479cb764ce47371bffee3c535550aa.svg","url":"Grassmannian"}
