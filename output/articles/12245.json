{"title":"Poincaré space","summary":"In algebraic topology, a Poincaré space is an n-dimensional topological space with a distinguished element µ of its nth homology group such that taking the cap product with an element of the kth cohomology group yields an isomorphism to the (n − k)th homology group.[1]  The space is essentially one for which Poincaré duality is valid; more precisely, one whose singular chain complex forms a Poincaré complex with respect to the distinguished element µ.","image":"43458fccbecd7e748851a81f669fa398ae1b3c54.svg","url":"Poincaré_space"}
