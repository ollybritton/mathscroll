{"title":"Parabiaugmented truncated dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the parabiaugmented truncated dodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (J69). As its name suggests, it is created by attaching two pentagonal cupolas (J5) onto two parallel decagonal faces of a truncated dodecahedron.","image":"Parabiaugmented_truncated_dodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Parabiaugmented_truncated_dodecahedron"}
