{"title":"Hexagram","summary":"A hexagram (Greek) or sexagram (Latin) is a six-pointed geometric star figure with the Schl√§fli symbol {6/2}, 2{3}, or {{3}}. Since there are no true regular continuous hexagrams, the term is instead used to refer to a compound figure of two equilateral triangles. The intersection is a regular hexagon.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Hexagram"}
