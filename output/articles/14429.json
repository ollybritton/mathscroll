{"title":"Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation","summary":"Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) is an algorithmic method for optimizing systems with multiple unknown parameters. It is a type of stochastic approximation algorithm. As an optimization method, it is appropriately suited to large-scale population models, adaptive modeling, simulation optimization, and atmospheric modeling. Many examples are presented at the SPSA website http://www.jhuapl.edu/SPSA. A comprehensive book on the subject is Bhatnagar et al. (2013). An early paper on the subject is Spall (1987) and the foundational paper providing the key theory and justification is Spall (1992).","image":"cfeddccb8efb954b55c85480a6fe7d4e33b60ab4.svg","url":"Simultaneous_perturbation_stochastic_approximation"}
