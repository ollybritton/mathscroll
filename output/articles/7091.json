{"title":"Hereditary C*-subalgebra","summary":"In mathematics, a hereditary C*-subalgebra of a C*-algebra is a particular type of C*-subalgebra whose structure is closely related to that of the larger C*-algebra. A C*-subalgebra  B of A is a hereditary C*-subalgebra if for all a ∈ A and b ∈ B such that 0 ≤ a ≤ b, we have a ∈ B.[1]","image":"f4cf94eb3f7202afdc4ac30e85636068c63f8e6a.svg","url":"Hereditary_C*-subalgebra"}
