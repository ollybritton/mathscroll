{"title":"Rational series","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, a rational series is a generalisation of the concept of formal power series over a ring to the case when the basic algebraic structure is no longer a ring but a semiring, and the indeterminates adjoined are not assumed to commute.  They can be regarded as algebraic expressions of a formal language over a finite alphabet.","image":"7a137659214b0fd8f9b567211905bccafe1f6df6.svg","url":"Rational_series"}
