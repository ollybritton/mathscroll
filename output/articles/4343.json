{"title":"Division ring","summary":"In algebra, a division ring, also called a skew field, is a nontrivial ring in which division by nonzero elements is defined. Specifically, it is a nontrivial ring[1] in which every nonzero element a has a multiplicative inverse, that is, an element usually denoted a–1, such that a a–1 = a–1 a = 1. So, (right) division may be defined as a / b = a b–1, but this notation is avoided, as one may have a b–1 ≠ b–1 a.","image":"36b05874c6cc3ed86307231fb488a97420fcb631.svg","url":"Division_ring"}
