{"title":"Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases","summary":"Mathematical models can project how infectious diseases progress to show the likely outcome of an epidemic (including in plants) and help inform public health and plant health interventions. Models use basic assumptions or collected statistics along with mathematics to find parameters for various infectious diseases and use those parameters to calculate the effects of different interventions, like mass vaccination programs. The modelling can help decide which intervention(s) to avoid and which to trial, or can predict future growth patterns, etc.","image":"642fc1668c4e820f1802335d3a51c09c76d64de3.svg","url":"Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_diseases"}
