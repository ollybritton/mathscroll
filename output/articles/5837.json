{"title":"Functional integration","summary":"Functional integration is a collection of results in mathematics and physics where the domain of an integral is no longer a region of space, but a space of functions. Functional integrals arise in probability, in the study of partial differential equations, and in the path integral approach to the quantum mechanics of particles and fields.","image":"0f3940cb3764acf34cf74cd14f212cae1aead5cf.svg","url":"Functional_integration"}
