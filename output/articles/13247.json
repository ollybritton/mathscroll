{"title":"Redheffer matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a Redheffer matrix, often denoted A n {\\displaystyle A_{n}} as studied by Redheffer (1977), is a square (0,1) matrix whose entries aij are 1 if i divides j or if j = 1; otherwise, aij = 0. It is useful in some contexts to express Dirichlet convolution, or convolved divisors sums, in terms of matrix products involving the transpose of the n t h {\\displaystyle n^{th}} Redheffer matrix.","image":"730f6906700685b6d52f3958b1c2ae659d2d97d2.svg","url":"Redheffer_matrix"}
