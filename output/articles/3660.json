{"title":"Curvilinear coordinates","summary":"In geometry, curvilinear coordinates are a coordinate system for Euclidean space in which the coordinate lines may be curved. These coordinates may be derived from a set of Cartesian coordinates by using a transformation that is locally invertible (a one-to-one map) at each point. This means that one can convert a point given in a Cartesian coordinate system to its curvilinear coordinates and back. The name curvilinear coordinates, coined by the French mathematician Lam√©, derives from the fact that the coordinate surfaces of the curvilinear systems are curved.","image":"Curvilinear.svg.png.webp","url":"Curvilinear_coordinates"}
