{"title":"Second-generation wavelet transform","summary":"In signal processing, the second-generation wavelet transform (SGWT) is a wavelet transform where the filters (or even the represented wavelets) are not designed explicitly, but the transform consists of the application of the Lifting scheme. Actually, the sequence of lifting steps could be converted to a regular discrete wavelet transform, but this is unnecessary because both design and application is made via the lifting scheme. This means that they are not designed in the frequency domain, as they are usually in the classical (so to speak first generation) transforms such as the DWT and CWT). The idea of moving away from the Fourier domain was introduced independently by David Donoho and Harten in the early 1990s.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Second-generation_wavelet_transform"}
