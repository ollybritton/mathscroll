{"title":"Hellinger distance","summary":"In probability and statistics, the Hellinger distance (closely related to, although different from, the Bhattacharyya distance) is used to quantify the similarity between two probability distributions. It is a type of f-divergence.  The Hellinger distance is defined in terms of the Hellinger integral, which was introduced by Ernst Hellinger in 1909.[1][2]","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Hellinger_distance"}
