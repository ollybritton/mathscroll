{"title":"Intersection graph","summary":"In graph theory, an intersection graph is a graph that represents the pattern of intersections of a family of sets. Any graph can be represented as an intersection graph, but some important special classes of graphs can be defined by the types of sets that are used to form an intersection representation of them.","image":"Intersection_graph.gif","url":"Intersection_graph"}
