{"title":"Babuška–Lax–Milgram theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Babuška–Lax–Milgram theorem is a generalization of the famous Lax–Milgram theorem, which gives conditions under which a bilinear form can be \"inverted\" to show the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to a given boundary value problem.  The result is named after the mathematicians Ivo Babuška, Peter Lax and Arthur Milgram.","image":"becb661a99b53290b8c979cce34e415c1e658653.svg","url":"Babuška–Lax–Milgram_theorem"}
