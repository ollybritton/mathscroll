{"title":"Scale-free network","summary":"A scale-free network is a network whose degree distribution follows a power law, at least asymptotically. That is, the fraction P(k) of nodes in the network having k connections to other nodes goes for large values of k as","image":"b4f4884468c8f31235f968aed34bab4e769cce4f.svg","url":"Scale-free_network"}
