{"title":"Arbitrary-precision arithmetic","summary":"In computer science, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, also called bignum arithmetic, multiple-precision arithmetic, or sometimes infinite-precision arithmetic, indicates that calculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are limited only by the available memory of the host system.  This contrasts with the faster fixed-precision arithmetic found in most arithmetic logic unit (ALU) hardware, which typically offers between 8 and 64 bits of precision.","image":"c2efb76ff22445ab918a112a0d4892d1c5d192f4.svg","url":"Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic"}
