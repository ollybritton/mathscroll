{"title":"Set-theoretic limit","summary":"In mathematics, the limit of a sequence of sets A 1 , A 2 , â€¦ {\\displaystyle A_{1},A_{2},\\ldots } (subsets of a common set X {\\displaystyle X} ) is a set whose elements are determined by the sequence in either of two equivalent ways: (1) by upper and lower bounds on the sequence that converge monotonically to the same set (analogous to convergence of real-valued sequences) and (2) by convergence of a sequence of indicator functions which are themselves real-valued. As is the case with sequences of other objects, convergence is not necessary or even usual.","image":"d55e1d38764038b4b6f5fba599b3b05b55f81c47.svg","url":"Set-theoretic_limit"}
