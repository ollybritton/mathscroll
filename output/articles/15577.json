{"title":"Tensor product of representations","summary":"In mathematics, the tensor product of representations is a tensor product of vector spaces underlying representations together with the factor-wise group action on the product. This construction, together with the Clebschâ€“Gordan procedure, can be used to generate additional irreducible representations if one already knows a few.","image":"50193d5201b7ff4d46487f5d5e58ee9c1e6f29fc.svg","url":"Tensor_product_of_representations"}
