{"title":"Krull's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in ring theory, Krull's theorem, named after Wolfgang Krull, asserts that a nonzero ring[1] has at least one maximal ideal.  The theorem was proved in 1929 by Krull, who used transfinite induction.  The theorem admits a simple proof using Zorn's lemma, and in fact is equivalent to Zorn's lemma,[2] which in turn is equivalent to the axiom of choice.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Krull's_theorem"}
