{"title":"Weight function","summary":"A weight function is a mathematical device used when performing a sum, integral, or average to give some elements more \"weight\" or influence on the result than other elements in the same set. The result of this application of a weight function is a weighted sum or weighted average. Weight functions occur frequently in statistics and analysis, and are closely related to the concept of a measure.  Weight functions can be employed in both discrete and continuous settings. They can be used to construct systems of calculus called \"weighted calculus\"[1] and \"meta-calculus\".[2]","image":"aae71187091f09e29ac97134481c48f6e6165259.svg","url":"Weight_function"}
