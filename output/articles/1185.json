{"title":"Axial symmetry","summary":"Axial symmetry is symmetry around an axis; an object is axially symmetric if its appearance is unchanged if rotated around an axis.[1]  For example, a baseball bat without trademark or other design, or a plain white tea saucer, looks the same if it is rotated by any angle about the line passing lengthwise through its center, so it is axially symmetric.","image":"Surface_of_revolution_illustration.png.webp","url":"Axial_symmetry"}
