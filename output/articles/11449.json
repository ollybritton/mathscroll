{"title":"Optical heterodyne detection","summary":"Optical heterodyne detection is a method of extracting information encoded as modulation of the phase, frequency or both of electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength band of visible or infrared light. The light signal is compared with standard or reference light from a \"local oscillator\" (LO) that would have a fixed offset in frequency and phase from the signal if the latter carried null information. \"Heterodyne\" signifies more than one frequency, in contrast to the single frequency employed in homodyne detection.[1]","image":"7b8b4a38cfd681f8581692c522554320e006858e.svg","url":"Optical_heterodyne_detection"}
