{"title":"Bauer–Fike theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Bauer–Fike theorem is a standard result in the perturbation theory of the eigenvalue of a complex-valued diagonalizable matrix. In its substance, it states an absolute upper bound for the deviation of one perturbed matrix eigenvalue from a properly chosen eigenvalue of the exact matrix. Informally speaking, what it says is that the sensitivity of the eigenvalues is estimated by the condition number of the matrix of eigenvectors.","image":"74fa251dfdde7f230a1359a4e75e2988e97f9235.svg","url":"Bauer–Fike_theorem"}
