{"title":"Bateman transform","summary":"In the mathematical study of partial differential equations, the Bateman transform is a method for solving the Laplace equation in four dimensions and wave equation in three by using a line integral of a holomorphic function in three complex variables.  It is named after the English mathematician Harry Bateman, who first published the result in (Bateman 1904).","image":"4951de5a9c83834bfcc767647a32bc6b69d00461.svg","url":"Bateman_transform"}
