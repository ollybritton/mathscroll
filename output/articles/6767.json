{"title":"Haagerup property","summary":"In mathematics, the Haagerup property, named after Uffe Haagerup and also known as Gromov's a-T-menability, is a property of groups that is a strong negation of Kazhdan's property (T).  Property (T) is considered a representation-theoretic form of rigidity, so the Haagerup property may be considered a form of strong nonrigidity; see below for details.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Haagerup_property"}
