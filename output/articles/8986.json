{"title":"Lamé function","summary":"In mathematics, a Lamé function, or ellipsoidal harmonic function, is a solution of Lamé's equation, a second-order ordinary differential equation.  It was introduced in the paper (Gabriel Lamé 1837). Lamé's equation appears in the method of separation of variables applied to the Laplace equation in elliptic coordinates. In some special cases solutions can be expressed in terms of polynomials called Lamé polynomials.","image":"8d90242716b2a1354c1161965c5bde5fc1db2da7.svg","url":"Lamé_function"}
