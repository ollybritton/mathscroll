{"title":"Half-space (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a half-space is either of the two parts into which a plane divides the three-dimensional Euclidean space. If the space is two-dimensional, then a half-space is called a half-plane (open or closed). A half-space in a one-dimensional space is called a half-line or ray.","image":"0143ed657762ca5e8271e2e00c34439a09703e22.svg","url":"Half-space_(geometry)"}
