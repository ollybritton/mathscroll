{"title":"Satisfaction equilibrium","summary":"In game theory, a satisfaction equilibrium is a solution concept for a class of non-cooperative games, namely games in satisfaction form. Games in satisfaction form model situations in which players aim at satisfying a given individual constraint, e.g., a performance metric must be smaller or bigger than a given threshold. When a player satisfies its own constraint, the player is said to be satisfied. A satisfaction equilibrium, if it exists, arises when all players in the game are satisfied.","image":"2796c221bd551c892b7ef337d7604e3aec0b5115.svg","url":"Satisfaction_equilibrium"}
