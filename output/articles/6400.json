{"title":"Gowers' theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Gowers' theorem, also known as Gowers' Ramsey theorem and Gowers' FINk theorem, is a theorem in Ramsey theory and combinatorics. It is a Ramsey-theoretic result about functions with finite support. Timothy Gowers originally proved the result in 1992,[1] motivated by a problem regarding Banach spaces. The result was subsequently generalised by Bartošová, Kwiatkowska,[2] and Lupini.[3]","image":"c4647669d51d83784f3e74f1e7a7e079cf267584.svg","url":"Gowers'_theorem"}
