{"title":"Generalized Petersen graph","summary":"In graph theory, the generalized Petersen graphs are a family of cubic graphs formed by connecting the vertices of a regular polygon to the corresponding vertices of a star polygon. They include the Petersen graph and generalize one of the ways of constructing the Petersen graph. The generalized Petersen graph family was introduced in 1950 by H. S. M. Coxeter[1] and was given its name in 1969 by Mark Watkins.[2]","image":"DÃ¼rer_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Generalized_Petersen_graph"}
