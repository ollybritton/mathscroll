{"title":"Life without Death","summary":"Life without Death is a cellular automaton, similar to Conway's Game of Life and other Life-like cellular automaton rules. In this cellular automaton, an initial seed pattern grows according to the same rule as in Conway's Game of Life; however, unlike Life, patterns never shrink. The rule was originally considered by Toffoli & Margolus (1987), who called it \"Inkspot\";[1] it has also been called \"Flakes\".[2] In contrast to the more complex patterns that exist within Conway's Game of Life, Life without Death commonly features still life patterns, in which no change occurs, and ladder patterns, that grow in a straight line.","image":"Without_death.gif","url":"Life_without_Death"}
