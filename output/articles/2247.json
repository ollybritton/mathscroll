{"title":"Carleson measure","summary":"In mathematics, a Carleson measure is a type of measure on subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn. Roughly speaking, a Carleson measure on a domain Ω is a measure that does not vanish at the boundary of Ω when compared to the surface measure on the boundary of Ω.","image":"cd2689a6bd00715549eda6bb86f72ced77c649f8.svg","url":"Carleson_measure"}
