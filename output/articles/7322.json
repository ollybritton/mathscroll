{"title":"Hodge star operator","summary":"In mathematics, the Hodge star operator or Hodge star is a linear map defined on the exterior algebra of a finite-dimensional oriented vector space endowed with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form.  Applying the operator to an element of the algebra produces the Hodge dual of the element.  This map was introduced by W. V. D. Hodge.","image":"14dcb867ba1cc064d2ab0c85590a87c8511e17d8.svg","url":"Hodge_star_operator"}
