{"title":"Statistical significance","summary":"In statistical hypothesis testing,[1][2] a result has statistical significance when a result at least as \"extreme\" would be very infrequent if the null hypothesis were true.[3] More precisely, a study's defined significance level, denoted by α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } , is the probability of the study rejecting the null hypothesis, given that the null hypothesis is true;[4] and the p-value of a result, p {\\displaystyle p} , is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.[5] The result is statistically significant, by the standards of the study, when p ≤ α {\\displaystyle p\\leq \\alpha } .[6][7][8][9][10][11][12] The significance level for a study is chosen before data collection, and is typically set to 5%[13] or much lower—depending on the field of study.[14]","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg","url":"Statistical_significance"}
