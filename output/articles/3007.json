{"title":"Complex conjugate of a vector space","summary":"In mathematics, the complex conjugate of a complex vector space V {\\displaystyle V\\,} is a complex vector space V ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\overline {V}}} , which has the same elements and additive group structure as V , {\\displaystyle V,} but whose scalar multiplication involves conjugation of the scalars. In other words, the scalar multiplication of V ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\overline {V}}} satisfies","image":"f7ee72790178407e3a145dec860bb78a56672b10.svg","url":"Complex_conjugate_of_a_vector_space"}
