{"title":"Oblate spheroidal coordinates","summary":"Oblate spheroidal coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from rotating the two-dimensional elliptic coordinate system about the non-focal axis of the ellipse, i.e., the symmetry axis that separates the foci. Thus, the two foci are transformed into a ring of radius a {\\displaystyle a} in the x-y plane.  (Rotation about the other axis produces prolate spheroidal coordinates.)  Oblate spheroidal coordinates can also be considered as a limiting case of ellipsoidal coordinates in which the two largest semi-axes are equal in length.","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"Oblate_spheroidal_coordinates"}
