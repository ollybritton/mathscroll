{"title":"Normal homomorphism","summary":"In algebra, a normal homomorphism is a ring homomorphism R → S {\\displaystyle R\\to S} that is flat and is such that for every field extension L of the residue field κ ( p ) {\\displaystyle \\kappa ({\\mathfrak {p}})} of any prime ideal p {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {p}}} , L ⊗ R S {\\displaystyle L\\otimes _{R}S} is a normal ring.","image":"499bc5e6b1153b43ba86d31780bc215f01aa0bf1.svg","url":"Normal_homomorphism"}
