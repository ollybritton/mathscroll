{"title":"Fokker–Planck equation","summary":"In statistical mechanics, the Fokker–Planck equation is a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of the probability density function of the velocity of a particle under the influence of drag forces and random forces, as in Brownian motion. The equation can be generalized to other observables as well.[1]","image":"FokkerPlanck.gif","url":"Fokker–Planck_equation"}
