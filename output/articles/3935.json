{"title":"Delta set","summary":"In mathematics, a Δ-set S, often called a Δ-complex or a semi-simplicial set, is a combinatorial object that is useful in the construction and triangulation of topological spaces, and also in the computation of related algebraic invariants of such spaces.  A Δ-set is somewhat more general than a simplicial complex, yet not quite as general as a simplicial set.","image":"Circle_structures.svg.png.webp","url":"Delta_set"}
