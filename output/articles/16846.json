{"title":"Wendel's theorem","summary":"In geometric probability theory, Wendel's theorem, named after James G. Wendel, gives the probability that N points distributed uniformly at random on an ( n âˆ’ 1 ) {\\displaystyle (n-1)} -dimensional hypersphere all lie on the same \"half\" of the hypersphere.  In other words, one seeks the probability that there is some half-space with the origin on its boundary that contains all N points.  Wendel's theorem says that the probability is[1]","image":"df88c6333caaf6471cf277f24b802ff9931b133e.svg","url":"Wendel's_theorem"}
