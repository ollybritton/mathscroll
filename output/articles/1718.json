{"title":"Bispherical coordinates","summary":"Bispherical coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from rotating the two-dimensional bipolar coordinate system about the axis that connects the two foci.  Thus, the two foci F 1 {\\displaystyle F_{1}} and F 2 {\\displaystyle F_{2}} in bipolar coordinates remain points (on the z {\\displaystyle z} -axis, the axis of rotation) in the bispherical coordinate system.","image":"100c7fbf174fe8b06eacc2a6b0bb2e1badd1c7ce.svg","url":"Bispherical_coordinates"}
