{"title":"B5 polytope","summary":"In 5-dimensional geometry, there are 31 uniform polytopes with B5 symmetry. There are two regular forms, the 5-orthoplex, and 5-cube with 10 and 32 vertices respectively. The 5-demicube is added as an alternation of the 5-cube.","image":"5-cube_t0.svg.png.webp","url":"B5_polytope"}
