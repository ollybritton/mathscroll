{"title":"Butterfly graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the butterfly graph (also called the bowtie graph and the hourglass graph) is a planar, undirected graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges.[1][2] It can be constructed by joining 2 copies of the cycle graph C3 with a common vertex and is therefore isomorphic to the friendship graph F2.","image":"Butterfly_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Butterfly_graph"}
