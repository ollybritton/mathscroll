{"title":"Shape","summary":"A shape or figure is a graphical representation of an object or its external boundary, outline, or external surface, as opposed to other properties such as color, texture, or material type. A plane shape or plane figure is constrained to lie on a plane, in contrast to solid 3D shapes. A two-dimensional shape or two-dimensional figure (also: 2D shape or 2D figure) may lie on a more general curved surface (a non-Euclidean two-dimensional space).","image":"Plastic_vormenstoof_of_puzzelbal_van_“Tupperware_Toy”%2C_objectnr_83212.JPG.webp","url":"Shape"}
