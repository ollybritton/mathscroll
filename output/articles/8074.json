{"title":"Isomorphism theorems","summary":"In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, the isomorphism theorems (also known as Noether's isomorphism theorems) are theorems that describe the relationship between quotients, homomorphisms, and subobjects.  Versions of the theorems exist for groups, rings, vector spaces, modules, Lie algebras, and various other algebraic structures.  In universal algebra, the isomorphism theorems can be generalized to the context of algebras and congruences.","image":"First-isomorphism-theorem.svg.png.webp","url":"Isomorphism_theorems"}
