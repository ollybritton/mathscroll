{"title":"Stable homotopy theory","summary":"In mathematics, stable homotopy theory is the part of homotopy theory (and thus algebraic topology) concerned with all structure and phenomena that remain after sufficiently many applications of the suspension functor.  A founding result was the Freudenthal suspension theorem, which states that given any pointed space X {\\displaystyle X} , the homotopy groups π n + k ( Σ n X ) {\\displaystyle \\pi _{n+k}(\\Sigma ^{n}X)} stabilize for n {\\displaystyle n} sufficiently large. In particular, the homotopy groups of spheres π n + k ( S n ) {\\displaystyle \\pi _{n+k}(S^{n})} stabilize for n ≥ k + 2 {\\displaystyle n\\geq k+2} .
