{"title":"Stericantitruncated tesseractic honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the stericantitruncated tesseractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling honeycomb. It is composed of runcitruncated 16-cell, cantitruncated tesseract, rhombicuboctahedral prism, truncated cuboctahedral prism, and 4-8 duoprism facets, arranged around an irregular 5-cell vertex figure.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Stericantitruncated_tesseractic_honeycomb"}
