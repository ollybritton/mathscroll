{"title":"Witten zeta function","summary":"In mathematics, the Witten zeta function, is a function associated to a root system that encodes the degrees of the irreducible representations of the corresponding Lie group. These zeta functions were introduced by Don Zagier who named them after Edward Witten's study of their special values (among other things).[1][2] Note that in,[2] Witten zeta functions do not appear as explicit objects in their own right.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Witten_zeta_function"}
