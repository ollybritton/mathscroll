{"title":"Crank–Nicolson method","summary":"In numerical analysis, the Crank–Nicolson method is a finite difference method used for numerically solving the heat equation and similar partial differential equations.[1] It is a second-order method in time. It is implicit in time, can be written as an implicit Runge–Kutta method, and it is numerically stable. The method was developed by John Crank and Phyllis Nicolson in the mid 20th century.[2]","image":"8c28867ecd34e2caed12cf38feadf6a81a7ee542.svg","url":"Crank–Nicolson_method"}
