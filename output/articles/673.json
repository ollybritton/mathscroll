{"title":"Alon–Boppana bound","summary":"In spectral graph theory, the Alon–Boppana bound provides a lower bound on the second-largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a d {\\displaystyle d} -regular graph,[1] meaning a graph in which every vertex has degree d {\\displaystyle d} . The reason for the interest in the second-largest eigenvalue is that the largest eigenvalue is guaranteed to be d {\\displaystyle d} due to d {\\displaystyle d} -regularity, with the all-ones vector being the associated eigenvector. The graphs that come close to meeting this bound are Ramanujan graphs, which are examples of the best possible expander graphs.","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Alon–Boppana_bound"}
