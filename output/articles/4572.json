{"title":"EHP spectral sequence","summary":"In mathematics, the EHP spectral sequence is a spectral sequence used for inductively calculating the homotopy groups of spheres localized at some prime p. It is described in more detail in Ravenel (2003, chapter 1.5) and Mahowald (2001). It is related to the EHP long exact sequence of Whitehead (1953); the name \"EHP\" comes from the fact that George W. Whitehead named 3 of the maps of his sequence \"E\" (the first letter of the German word \"Einhängung\" meaning \"suspension\"), \"H\" (for Heinz Hopf, as this map is the second Hopf–James invariant), and \"P\" (related to Whitehead products).","image":"d62e4100b94c1939c67f2d4b8580d26c78106c44.svg","url":"EHP_spectral_sequence"}
