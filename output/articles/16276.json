{"title":"Two ears theorem","summary":"In geometry, the two ears theorem states that every simple polygon with more than three vertices has at least two ears, vertices that can be removed from the polygon without introducing any crossings. The two ears theorem is equivalent to the existence of polygon triangulations. It is frequently attributed to Gary H. Meisters, but was proved earlier by Max Dehn.","image":"Triangulation_3-coloring.svg.png.webp","url":"Two_ears_theorem"}
