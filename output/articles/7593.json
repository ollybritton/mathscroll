{"title":"Icosahedral bipyramid","summary":"In 4-dimensional geometry, the icosahedral bipyramid is the direct sum of a icosahedron and a segment, {3,5} + { }. Each face of a central icosahedron is attached with two tetrahedra, creating 40 tetrahedral cells, 80 triangular faces, 54 edges, and 14 vertices.[1] An icosahedral bipyramid can be seen as two icosahedral pyramids augmented together at their bases.","image":"Icosahedral_bipyramid-ortho.png.webp","url":"Icosahedral_bipyramid"}
