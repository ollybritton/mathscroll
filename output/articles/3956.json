{"title":"Dense-in-itself","summary":"In general topology, a subset A {\\displaystyle A} of a topological space is said to be dense-in-itself[1][2] or crowded[3][4] if A {\\displaystyle A} has no isolated point. Equivalently, A {\\displaystyle A} is dense-in-itself if every point of A {\\displaystyle A} is a limit point of A {\\displaystyle A} . Thus A {\\displaystyle A} is dense-in-itself if and only if A ⊆ A ′ {\\displaystyle A\\subseteq A'} , where A ′ {\\displaystyle A'} is the derived set of A {\\displaystyle A} .","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Dense-in-itself"}
