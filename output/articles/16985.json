{"title":"Willmore energy","summary":"In differential geometry, the Willmore energy is a quantitative measure of how much a given surface deviates from a round sphere.  Mathematically, the Willmore energy of a smooth closed surface embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined to be the integral of the square of the mean curvature minus the Gaussian curvature.  It is named after the English geometer Thomas Willmore.","image":"Willmore_Surface_sculpture_Durham.jpg.webp","url":"Willmore_energy"}
