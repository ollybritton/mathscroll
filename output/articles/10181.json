{"title":"Maurer–Cartan form","summary":"In mathematics, the Maurer–Cartan form for a Lie group G is a distinguished differential one-form on G that carries the basic infinitesimal information about the structure of G. It was much used by Élie Cartan as a basic ingredient of his method of moving frames, and bears his name together with that of Ludwig Maurer.","image":"f3de6d4c5443cbebb8f69360b8536d8c6f2888cc.svg","url":"Maurer–Cartan_form"}
