{"title":"Convolution theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the convolution theorem states that under suitable conditions the Fourier transform of a convolution of two functions (or signals) is the pointwise product of their Fourier transforms. More generally, convolution in one domain (e.g., time domain) equals point-wise multiplication in the other domain (e.g., frequency domain). Other versions of the convolution theorem are applicable to various Fourier-related transforms.","image":"c6ca91363022bd5e4dcb17e5ef29f78b8ef00b59.svg","url":"Convolution_theorem"}
