{"title":"Yates's correction for continuity","summary":"In statistics, Yates's correction for continuity (or Yates's chi-squared test) is used in certain situations when testing for independence in a contingency table. It aims at correcting the error introduced by assuming that the discrete probabilities of frequencies in the table can be approximated by a continuous distribution (chi-squared). In some cases, Yates's correction may adjust too far, and so its current use is limited.","image":"e756768c89f08a12ff8d7050baeaef2f0205fadc.svg","url":"Yates's_correction_for_continuity"}
