{"title":"Attractor","summary":"In the mathematical field of dynamical systems, an attractor is a set of states toward which a system tends to evolve,[2] for a wide variety of starting conditions of the system. System values that get close enough to the attractor values remain close even if slightly disturbed.","image":"Poisson_saturne_revisited.jpg.webp","url":"Attractor"}
