{"title":"Scenario optimization","summary":"The scenario approach or scenario optimization approach is a technique for obtaining solutions to robust optimization and chance-constrained optimization problems based on a sample of the constraints. It also relates to inductive reasoning in modeling and decision-making. The technique has existed for decades as a heuristic approach and has more recently been given a systematic theoretical foundation.","image":"0e79dc1b001f8b923df475ed14de023cbc456013.svg","url":"Scenario_optimization"}
