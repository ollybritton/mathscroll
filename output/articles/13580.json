{"title":"Right group","summary":"In mathematics, a right group[1][2] is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with a binary operation that combines two elements into a third element while obeying the right group axioms. The right group axioms are similar to the group axioms, but while groups can have only one identity and any element can have only one inverse, right groups allow for multiple one-sided identity elements and multiple  one-sided inverse elements.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Right_group"}
