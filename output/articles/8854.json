{"title":"Krull dimension","summary":"In commutative algebra, the Krull dimension of a commutative ring R, named after Wolfgang Krull, is the supremum of the lengths of all chains of prime ideals. The Krull dimension need not be finite even for a Noetherian ring. More generally the Krull dimension can be defined for modules over possibly non-commutative rings as the deviation of the poset of submodules.","image":"fcb33c8d5a2f5108db7d78ae3bb0e0499b0f6794.svg","url":"Krull_dimension"}
