{"title":"Rotunda (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a rotunda is any member of a family of dihedral-symmetric polyhedra. They are similar to a cupola but instead of alternating squares and triangles, it alternates pentagons and triangles around an axis. The pentagonal rotunda is a Johnson solid.","image":"Pentagonal_rotunda.png.webp","url":"Rotunda_(geometry)"}
