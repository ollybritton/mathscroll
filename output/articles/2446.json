{"title":"Cereceda's conjecture","summary":"In the mathematics of graph coloring, Cerecedaâ€™s conjecture is an unsolved problem on the distance between pairs of colorings of sparse graphs. It states that, for two different colorings of a graph of degeneracy d, both using at most d + 2 colors, it should be possible to reconfigure one coloring into the other by changing the color of one vertex at a time, using a number of steps that is quadratic in the size of the graph. The conjecture is named after Luis Cereceda, who formulated it in his 2007 doctoral dissertation.","image":"eca73cfcd47431cdbe3d5a7b25dc75877b72d30e.svg","url":"Cereceda's_conjecture"}
