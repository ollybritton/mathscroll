{"title":"Factorial moment","summary":"In probability theory, the factorial moment is a mathematical quantity defined as the expectation or average of the falling factorial of a random variable. Factorial moments are  useful for studying non-negative integer-valued random variables,[1] and arise in the use of probability-generating functions to derive the moments of discrete random variables.","image":"21967b6d8a0c514ce6ac058c019090f9cdb62d85.svg","url":"Factorial_moment"}
