{"title":"Serre spectral sequence","summary":"In mathematics, the Serre spectral sequence (sometimes Lerayâ€“Serre spectral sequence to acknowledge earlier work of Jean Leray in the Leray spectral sequence) is an important tool in algebraic topology. It expresses, in the language of homological algebra, the singular (co)homology of the total space X of a (Serre) fibration in terms of the (co)homology of the base space B and the fiber F. The result is due to Jean-Pierre Serre in his doctoral dissertation.","image":"d1f4dd766fa96e2a0b48f4e71119a75383f0489d.svg","url":"Serre_spectral_sequence"}
