{"title":"Word problem (mathematics)","summary":"In computational mathematics, a word problem is the problem of deciding whether two given expressions are equivalent with respect to a set of rewriting identities. A prototypical example is the word problem for groups, but there are many other instances as well. A deep result of computational theory is that answering this question is in many important cases undecidable.[1]","image":"bbeca34b28f569a407ef74a955d041df9f360268.svg","url":"Word_problem_(mathematics)"}
