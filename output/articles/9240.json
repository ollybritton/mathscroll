{"title":"Levi graph","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, a Levi graph or incidence graph is a bipartite graph associated with an incidence structure.[1][2] From a collection of points and lines in an incidence geometry or a projective configuration, we form a graph with one vertex per point, one vertex per line, and an edge for every incidence between a point and a line. They are named for Friedrich Wilhelm Levi, who wrote about them in 1942.[1][3]","image":"Levi_graph_of_Pappus_Configuration.png.webp","url":"Levi_graph"}
