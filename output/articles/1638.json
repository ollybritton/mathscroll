{"title":"Binary icosahedral group","summary":"In mathematics, the binary icosahedral group 2I or ⟨2,3,5⟩[1] is a certain nonabelian group of order 120. It is an extension of the icosahedral group I or (2,3,5) of order 60 by the cyclic group of order 2, and is the preimage of the icosahedral group under the 2:1 covering homomorphism","image":"6515fcceb7a7f400a870ebf72006082bd44846c0.svg","url":"Binary_icosahedral_group"}
