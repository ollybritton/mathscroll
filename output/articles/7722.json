{"title":"Indeterminate system","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in algebra, an indeterminate system is a system of simultaneous equations (e.g., linear equations) which has more than one solution (sometimes infinitely many solutions).[1] In the case of a linear system, the system may be said to be underspecified, in which case the presence of more than one solution would imply an infinite number of solutions (since the system would be describable in terms of at least one free variable[2]), but that property does not extend to nonlinear systems (e.g., the system with the equation x 2 = 1 {\\displaystyle x^{2}=1} ).","image":"51e28d7561fa4fe556f438b88380ef98c5631cf5.svg","url":"Indeterminate_system"}
