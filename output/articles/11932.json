{"title":"Pedal equation","summary":"For a plane curve C and a given fixed point O, the pedal equation of the curve is a relation between r and p where r is the distance from O to a point on C and p is the perpendicular distance from O to the tangent line to C at the point. The point O is called the pedal point and the values r and p are sometimes called the pedal coordinates of a point relative to the curve and the pedal point. It is also useful to measure the distance of O to the normal p c {\\displaystyle p_{c}} (the contrapedal coordinate) even though it is not an independent quantity and it relates to ( r , p ) {\\displaystyle (r,p)} as p c := r 2 âˆ’ p 2 {\\displaystyle p_{c}:={\\sqrt {r^{2}-p^{2}}}} .","image":"836639c3805ca867b1ff24dc6db7a6b24fc69158.svg","url":"Pedal_equation"}
