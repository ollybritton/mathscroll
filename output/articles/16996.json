{"title":"Wirtinger's inequality for functions","summary":"In the mathematical field of analysis, the Wirtinger inequality is an important inequality for functions of a single variable, named after Wilhelm Wirtinger. It was used by Adolf Hurwitz in 1901 to give a new proof of the isoperimetric inequality for curves in the plane.  A variety of closely related results are today known as Wirtinger's inequality, all of which can be viewed as certain forms of the Poincar√© inequality.","image":"c13d4052fd7b551e85be4523793019d57cfa374c.svg","url":"Wirtinger's_inequality_for_functions"}
