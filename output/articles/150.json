{"title":"Arzelà–Ascoli theorem","summary":"The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem is a fundamental result of mathematical analysis giving necessary and sufficient conditions to decide whether every sequence of a given family of real-valued continuous functions defined on a closed and bounded interval has a uniformly convergent subsequence.  The main condition is the equicontinuity of the family of functions. The theorem is the basis of many proofs in mathematics, including that of the Peano existence theorem in the theory of ordinary differential equations, Montel's theorem in complex analysis, and the Peter–Weyl theorem in harmonic analysis and various results concerning compactness of integral operators.","image":"c98e96b54c3b6bad9f60222de8cf08fcbd4ecc3d.svg","url":"A%2fArzelà–Ascoli_theorem"}
