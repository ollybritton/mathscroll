{"title":"Chirp Z-transform","summary":"The chirp Z-transform (CZT) is a generalization of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).  While the DFT samples the Z plane at uniformly-spaced points along the unit circle, the chirp Z-transform samples along spiral arcs in the Z-plane, corresponding to straight lines in the S plane.[1][2]  The DFT, real DFT, and zoom DFT can be calculated as special cases of the CZT.","image":"241800fdadb99ae37f4704f69cf56793e203febc.svg","url":"Chirp_Z-transform"}
