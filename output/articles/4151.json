{"title":"Dinic's algorithm","summary":"Dinic's algorithm or Dinitz's algorithm is a strongly polynomial algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a flow network, conceived in 1970 by Israeli (formerly Soviet) computer scientist Yefim (Chaim) A. Dinitz.[1] The algorithm runs in O ( V 2 E ) {\\displaystyle O(V^{2}E)} time and is similar to the Edmondsâ€“Karp algorithm, which runs in O ( V E 2 ) {\\displaystyle O(VE^{2})} time, in that it uses shortest augmenting paths. The introduction of the concepts of the level graph and blocking flow enable Dinic's algorithm to achieve its performance.","image":"7edf8b23e2ba797ea75ebe290d8f580b60cb0c3a.svg","url":"Dinic's_algorithm"}
