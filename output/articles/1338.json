{"title":"Barth surface","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a Barth surface is one of the complex nodal surfaces in 3 dimensions with large numbers of double points found by Wolf BarthÂ (1996). Two examples are the Barth sextic of degree 6 with 65 double points, and the Barth decic of degree 10 with 345 double points.","image":"3D_model_of_Barth-sextic.stl.png.webp","url":"Barth_surface"}
