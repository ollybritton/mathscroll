{"title":"K채hler differential","summary":"In mathematics, K채hler differentials provide an adaptation of differential forms to arbitrary commutative rings or schemes. The notion was introduced by Erich K채hler in the 1930s. It was adopted as standard in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry somewhat later, once the need was felt to adapt methods from calculus and geometry over the complex numbers to contexts where such methods are not available.","image":"83b0944b88d2c5081b2ffb6b15fdce18f297db4c.svg","url":"K채hler_differential"}
