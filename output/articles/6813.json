{"title":"Half range Fourier series","summary":"In mathematics, a half range Fourier series is a Fourier series defined on an interval [ 0 , L ] {\\displaystyle [0,L]} instead of the more common [ − L , L ] {\\displaystyle [-L,L]} , with the implication that the analyzed function f ( x ) , x ∈ [ 0 , L ] {\\displaystyle f(x),x\\in [0,L]} should be extended to [ − L , 0 ] {\\displaystyle [-L,0]} as either an even (f(-x)=f(x)) or odd function (f(-x)=-f(x)). This allows the expansion of the function in a series solely of sines (odd) or cosines (even). The choice between odd and even is typically motivated by boundary conditions associated with a differential equation satisfied by f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} .","image":"53e3bfad6c2b8297e8c8d2e84ce8f869d69b0d86.svg","url":"Half_range_Fourier_series"}
