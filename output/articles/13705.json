{"title":"Rooted product of graphs","summary":"In mathematical graph theory, the rooted product of a graph G and a rooted graph H is defined as follows: take |V(G)| copies of H, and for every vertex v i {\\displaystyle v_{i}} of G, identify v i {\\displaystyle v_{i}} with the root node of the i-th copy of H.","image":"7dffe5726650f6daac54829972a94f38eb8ec127.svg","url":"Rooted_product_of_graphs"}
