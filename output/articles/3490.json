{"title":"Counting quantification","summary":"A counting quantifier is a mathematical term for a quantifier of the form \"there exists at least k elements that satisfy property X\". In first-order logic with equality, counting quantifiers can be defined in terms of ordinary quantifiers, so in this context they are a notational shorthand. However, they are interesting in the context of logics such as two-variable logic with counting that restrict the number of variables in formulas. Also, generalized counting quantifiers that say \"there exists infinitely many\" are not expressible using a finite number of formulas in first-order logic.","image":"ca84c827d32a2e7cbcaa9edf9474a1b8e2633488.svg","url":"Counting_quantification"}
