{"title":"Associated bundle","summary":"In mathematics, the theory of fiber bundles with a structure group G {\\displaystyle G} (a topological group) allows an operation of creating an associated bundle, in which the typical fiber of a bundle changes from F 1 {\\displaystyle F_{1}} to F 2 {\\displaystyle F_{2}} , which are both topological spaces with a group action of G {\\displaystyle G} .  For a fiber bundle F with structure group G, the transition functions of the fiber (i.e., the cocycle) in an overlap of two coordinate systems Uα and Uβ are given as a G-valued function gαβ on Uα∩Uβ.  One may then construct a fiber bundle F′ as a new fiber bundle having the same transition functions, but possibly a different fiber.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Associated_bundle"}
