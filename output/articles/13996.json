{"title":"Schwartz–Bruhat function","summary":"In mathematics, a Schwartz–Bruhat function, named after Laurent Schwartz and François Bruhat, is a complex valued function on a locally compact abelian group, such as the adeles, that generalizes a Schwartz function on a real vector space. A tempered distribution is defined as a continuous linear functional on the space of Schwartz–Bruhat functions.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Schwartz–Bruhat_function"}
