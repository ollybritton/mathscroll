{"title":"Isotoxal figure","summary":"In geometry, a polytope (for example, a polygon or a polyhedron) or a tiling is isotoxal (from Greek   τόξον  'arc') or edge-transitive if its symmetries act transitively on its edges. Informally, this means that there is only one type of edge to the object: given two edges, there is a translation, rotation, and/or reflection that will move one edge to the other, while leaving the region occupied by the object unchanged.","image":"42d3d982c0a63d59f04a9ea9aecec75fb107f6a3.svg","url":"Isotoxal_figure"}
