{"title":"Ultrametric space","summary":"In mathematics, an ultrametric space is a metric space in which the triangle inequality is strengthened to d ( x , z ) â‰¤ max { d ( x , y ) , d ( y , z ) } {\\displaystyle d(x,z)\\leq \\max \\left\\{d(x,y),d(y,z)\\right\\}} . Sometimes the associated metric is also called a non-Archimedean metric or super-metric. Although some of the theorems for ultrametric spaces may seem strange at a first glance, they appear naturally in many applications.","image":"e76eb59e11a15c12e0fd06c89441a376f51554f3.svg","url":"Ultrametric_space"}
