{"title":"Convex polygon","summary":"In geometry, a convex polygon is a polygon that is the boundary of a convex set. This means that the line segment between two points of the polygon is contained in the union of the interior and the boundary of the polygon. In particular, it is a simple polygon (not self-intersecting).[1]  Equivalently, a polygon is convex if every line that does not contain any edge intersects the polygon in at most two points.","image":"Pentagon.svg.png.webp","url":"Convex_polygon"}
