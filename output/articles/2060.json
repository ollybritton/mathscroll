{"title":"Buridan formula","summary":"In quantified modal logic, the Buridan formula and the converse Buridan formula (more accurately, schemata rather than formulas) (i) syntactically state principles of interchange between quantifiers and modalities; (ii) semantically state a relation between domains of possible worlds. The formulas are named in honor of the medieval philosopher Jean Buridan by analogy with the Barcan formula and the converse Barcan formula introduced as axioms by Ruth Barcan Marcus.[1]","image":"9a02a059cde63d99a41c5522a2f8ad49156d5202.svg","url":"Buridan_formula"}
