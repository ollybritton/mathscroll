{"title":"Rhombitetraheptagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the rhombitetraheptagonal tiling is a uniform tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It has Schl√§fli symbol of rr{4,7}. It can be seen as constructed as a rectified tetraheptagonal tiling, r{7,4}, as well as an expanded order-4 heptagonal tiling or expanded order-7 square tiling.","image":"H2_tiling_247-5.png.webp","url":"Rhombitetraheptagonal_tiling"}
