{"title":"Rectified tesseractic honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the rectified tesseractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 4-space. It is constructed by a rectification of a tesseractic honeycomb which creates new vertices on the middle of all the original edges, rectifying the cells into rectified tesseracts, and adding new 16-cell facets at the original vertices. Its vertex figure is an octahedral prism, {3,4}Ã—{}.","image":"CDel_node.png.webp","url":"Rectified_tesseractic_honeycomb"}
