{"title":"Antichamber","summary":"Antichamber is a first-person puzzle-platform game created by Australian developer Alexander \"Demruth\" Bruce. Many of the puzzles are based on phenomena that occur within impossible objects created by the game engine, such as passages that lead the player to different locations depending on which way they face, and structures that seem otherwise impossible within normal three-dimensional space. The game includes elements of psychological exploration through brief messages of advice to help the player figure out solutions to the puzzles as well as adages for real life. The game was released on Steam for Microsoft Windows on January 31, 2013.[1] A version originally sold with the Humble Indie Bundle 11 in 2014 added support for Linux and OS X.","image":"Antichamber_logo.png.webp","url":"Antichamber"}
