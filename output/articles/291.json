{"title":"Abstract algebra","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically algebra, abstract algebra or modern algebra is the study of algebraic structures.[1] Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras over a field. The term abstract algebra was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish it from older parts of algebra, and more specifically from elementary algebra, the use of variables to represent numbers in computation and reasoning. Presently, the term \"abstract algebra\" is typically used for naming courses in mathematical education, and is rarely used in advanced mathematics.","image":"Rubik's_cube_v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Abstract_algebra"}
