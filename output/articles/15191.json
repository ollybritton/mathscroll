{"title":"Subgraph isomorphism problem","summary":"In theoretical computer science, the subgraph isomorphism problem is a computational task in which two graphs G and H are given as input, and one must determine whether G contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to H. Subgraph isomorphism is a generalization of both the maximum clique problem and the problem of testing whether a graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle, and is therefore NP-complete.[1] However certain other cases of subgraph isomorphism may be solved in polynomial time.[2]","image":"644a8d85ee410b6159ca2bdb5dcb9097e2c8f182.svg","url":"Subgraph_isomorphism_problem"}
