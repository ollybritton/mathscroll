{"title":"Sierpiński number","summary":"In number theory, a Sierpiński number is an odd natural number k such that k × 2 n + 1 {\\displaystyle k\\times 2^{n}+1} is composite for all natural numbers n. In 1960, Wacław Sierpiński proved that there are infinitely many odd integers k which have this property.","image":"786f0137f00467b1690b5736c5d142842b1a9807.svg","url":"Sierpiński_number"}
