{"title":"Linear-fractional programming","summary":"In mathematical optimization, linear-fractional programming (LFP) is a generalization of linear programming (LP). Whereas the objective function in a linear program is a linear function, the objective function in a linear-fractional program is a ratio of two linear functions. A linear program can be regarded as a special case of a linear-fractional program in which the denominator is the constant function 1.","image":"b7d2d284b8386e87be214c155dc706088299f651.svg","url":"Linear-fractional_programming"}
