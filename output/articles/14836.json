{"title":"Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions","summary":"In mathematics, the interplay between the Galois group G of a Galois extension L of a number field K, and the way the prime ideals P of the ring of integers OK factorise as products of prime ideals of OL, provides one of the richest parts of algebraic number theory. The splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions is sometimes attributed to David Hilbert by calling it Hilbert theory. There is a geometric analogue, for ramified coverings of Riemann surfaces, which is simpler in that only one kind of subgroup of G need be considered, rather than two. This was certainly familiar before Hilbert.","image":"ced5621db335eab175e6b60e137e26bd71768c1e.svg","url":"Splitting_of_prime_ideals_in_Galois_extensions"}
