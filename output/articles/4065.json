{"title":"Difference hierarchy","summary":"In set theory, a branch of mathematics, the difference hierarchy over a pointclass is a hierarchy of larger pointclasses generated by taking differences of sets. If Γ is a pointclass, then the set of differences in Γ is Failed to parse (SVG (MathML can be enabled via browser plugin): Invalid response (\"Math extension cannot connect to Restbase.\") from server \"/mathoid/local/v1/\":): {\\displaystyle \\{A:\\exists C,D\\in\\Gamma ( A = C\\setminus D)\\}} . In usual notation, this set is denoted by 2-Γ. The next level of the hierarchy is denoted by 3-Γ and consists of differences of three sets: { A : ∃ C , D , E ∈ Γ ( A = C ∖ ( D ∖ E ) ) } {\\displaystyle \\{A:\\exists C,D,E\\in \\Gamma (A=C\\setminus (D\\setminus E))\\}} . This definition can be extended recursively into the transfinite to α-Γ for some ordinal α.[1]","image":"f19790ce1b0f8db265bf94c1004bcea46c4e86a4.svg","url":"Difference_hierarchy"}
