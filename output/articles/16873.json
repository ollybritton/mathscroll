{"title":"White noise analysis","summary":"In probability theory, a branch of mathematics, white noise analysis, otherwise known as Hida calculus, is a framework for infinite-dimensional and stochastic calculus, based on the Gaussian white noise probability space, to be compared with Malliavin calculus based on the Wiener process.[1] It was initiated by Takeyuki Hida in his 1975 Carleton Mathematical Lecture Notes.[2]","image":"9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161.svg","url":"White_noise_analysis"}
