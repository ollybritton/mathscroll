{"title":"Pyramidal number","summary":"A pyramidal number is a figurate number that represents a pyramid with a polygonal base and a given number of triangular sides.  A pyramidal number is the number of points in a pyramid where each layer of the pyramid is an r-sided polygon of points.[1] The term often refers to square pyramidal numbers, which have a square base with four sides, but it can also refer to pyramids with three or more sides.[2] The numbers of points in the base (and in parallel layers to the base) are given by polygonal numbers of the given number of sides, while the numbers of points in each triangular side is given by a triangular number. It is possible to extend the pyramidal numbers to higher dimensions.","image":"Square_pyramidal_number.svg.png.webp","url":"Pyramidal_number"}
