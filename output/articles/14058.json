{"title":"Sectorial operator","summary":"In mathematics, more precisely in operator theory, a sectorial operator is a linear operator on a Banach space, whose spectrum in an open sector in the complex plane and whose resolvent is uniformly bounded from above outside any larger sector. Such operators might be unbounded.","image":"258512fa727a69eec5255c3049ca4f999abd74ab.svg","url":"Sectorial_operator"}
