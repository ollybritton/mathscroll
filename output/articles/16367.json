{"title":"Uniform polytope","summary":"In geometry, a uniform polytope of dimension three or higher is a vertex-transitive polytope bounded by uniform facets. The uniform polytopes in two dimensions are the regular polygons (the definition is different in 2 dimensions to exclude vertex-transitive even-sided polygons that alternate two different lengths of edges).","image":"Truncated_triangle.svg.png.webp","url":"Uniform_polytope"}
