{"title":"Bounded deformation","summary":"In mathematics, a function of bounded deformation is a function whose distributional derivatives are not quite well-behaved-enough to qualify as functions of bounded variation, although the symmetric part of the derivative matrix does meet that condition. Thought of as deformations of elasto-plastic bodies, functions of bounded deformation play a major role in the mathematical study of materials, e.g. the Francfort-Marigo model of brittle crack evolution.","image":"ebced6e88854fe8a527ff2e677b794e9353cf798.svg","url":"Bounded_deformation"}
