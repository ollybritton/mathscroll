{"title":"Functional completeness","summary":"In logic, a functionally complete set of logical connectives or Boolean operators is one which can be used to express all possible truth tables by combining members of the set into a Boolean expression.[1][2] A well-known complete set of connectives is { AND, NOT }. Each of the singleton sets { NAND } and { NOR } is functionally complete. However, the set { AND, OR } is incomplete, due to its inability to express NOT.","image":"d6823e5a222eb3ca49672818ac3d13ec607052c4.svg","url":"Functional_completeness"}
