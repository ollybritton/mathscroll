{"title":"Absolute difference","summary":"The absolute difference of two real numbers x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} is given by | x − y | {\\displaystyle |x-y|} , the absolute value of their difference. It describes the distance on the real line between the points corresponding to x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} . It is a special case of the Lp distance for all 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ {\\displaystyle 1\\leq p\\leq \\infty } and is the standard metric used for both the set of rational numbers Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } and their completion, the set of real numbers R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } .","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Absolute_difference"}
