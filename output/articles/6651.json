{"title":"Grünbaum–Rigby configuration","summary":"In geometry, the Grünbaum–Rigby configuration is a symmetric configuration consisting of 21 points and 21 lines, with four points on each line and four lines through each point. Originally studied by Felix Klein in the complex projective plane in connection with the Klein quartic, it was first realized in the Euclidean plane by Branko Grünbaum and John F. Rigby.","image":"Grünbaum-Rigby_configuration%2C_vector_graphics.svg.png.webp","url":"Grünbaum–Rigby_configuration"}
