{"title":"Polycon","summary":"In geometry, a polycon  is a kind of a developable roller. It is made of identical pieces of a cone whose apex angle equals the angle of an even sided regular polygon.[1][2] In principle, there are infinitely many polycons, as many as there are even sided regular polygons.[3] Most members of the family have elongated spindle like shapes. The polycon family generalizes the sphericon. It was discovered by the Israeli inventor David Hirsch in 2017[1]","image":"f3d44da959fc09a4707237474bac8e6439dd94db.svg","url":"Polycon"}
