{"title":"Simplicial set","summary":"In mathematics, a simplicial set is an object composed of simplices in a specific way. Simplicial sets are higher-dimensional generalizations of directed graphs, partially ordered sets and categories. Formally, a simplicial set may be defined as a contravariant functor from the simplex category to the category of sets. Simplicial sets were introduced in 1950 by Samuel Eilenberg and Joseph A. Zilber.[1]","image":"602c26a990b51cd58afada2f9c88840976f5af50.svg","url":"Simplicial_set"}
