{"title":"Bicyclic semigroup","summary":"In mathematics, the bicyclic semigroup is an algebraic object important for the structure theory of semigroups. Although it is in fact a monoid, it is usually referred to as simply a semigroup. It is perhaps most easily understood as the syntactic monoid describing the Dyck language of balanced pairs of parentheses. Thus, it finds common applications in combinatorics, such as describing binary trees and associative algebras.","image":"e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019.svg","url":"Bicyclic_semigroup"}
