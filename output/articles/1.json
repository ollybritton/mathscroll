{"title":"(2,3,7) triangle group","summary":"In the theory of Riemann surfaces and hyperbolic geometry, the triangle group (2,3,7) is particularly important. This importance stems from its connection to Hurwitz surfaces, namely Riemann surfaces of genus g with the largest possible order, 84(g âˆ’ 1), of its automorphism group.","image":"H2checkers_237.png.webp","url":"(2,3,7)_triangle_group"}
