{"title":"Higher-dimensional gamma matrices","summary":"In mathematical physics, higher-dimensional gamma matrices generalize to arbitrary dimension the four-dimensional Gamma matrices of Dirac, which are a mainstay of relativistic quantum mechanics.  They are utilized in relativistically invariant wave equations for fermions (such as spinors)  in arbitrary space-time dimensions, notably in string theory and supergravity. The Weylâ€“Brauer matrices provide an explicit construction of higher-dimensional gamma matrices for Weyl spinors. Gamma matrices also appear in generic settings in Riemannian geometry, particularly when a spin structure can be defined.","image":"3ae47266aa93922091624026856db3d1475de500.svg","url":"Higher-dimensional_gamma_matrices"}
