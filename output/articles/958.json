{"title":"Area of a triangle","summary":"Calculating the area of a triangle is an elementary problem encountered often in many different situations. The best known and simplest formula is T = b h / 2 , {\\displaystyle T=bh/2,} where b is the length of the base of the triangle, and h is the height or altitude of the triangle. The term \"base\" denotes any side, and \"height\" denotes the length of a perpendicular from the vertex opposite the base onto the line containing the base. In 499 CE Aryabhata, used this illustrated method in the Aryabhatiya (section 2.6).[1]","image":"0434f488739b36b7939ad5c7a39e1c90fc505157.svg","url":"Area_of_a_triangle"}
