{"title":"Orbit trap","summary":"In mathematics, an orbit trap is a method of colouring fractal images based upon how close an iterative function, used to create the fractal, approaches a geometric shape, called a \"trap\". Typical traps are points, lines, circles, flower shapes and even raster images. Orbit traps are typically used to colour two dimensional fractals representing the complex plane.","image":"Line_and_point_trap_golden.png.webp","url":"Orbit_trap"}
