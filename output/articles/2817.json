{"title":"Cocycle","summary":"In mathematics a cocycle is a closed cochain.  Cocycles are used in algebraic topology to express obstructions (for example, to integrating a differential equation on a closed manifold).  They are likewise used in group cohomology.  In autonomous dynamical systems, cocycles are used to describe particular kinds of map, as in the Oseledets theorem.[1]","image":"68bf03eb518f7327a37d762bc8f48e5441d5d933.svg","url":"Cocycle"}
