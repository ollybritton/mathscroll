{"title":"Almost surely","summary":"In probability theory, an event is said to happen almost surely (sometimes abbreviated as a.s.) if it happens with probability 1 (or Lebesgue measure 1).[1] In other words, the set of possible exceptions may be non-empty, but it has probability 0. The concept is analogous to the concept of \"almost everywhere\" in measure theory.","image":"9d77104a5c3c49cc0634dcf6908db7ad45f738d2.svg","url":"Almost_surely"}
