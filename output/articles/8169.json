{"title":"Jacobian ideal","summary":"In mathematics the Jacobian ideal or gradient ideal is the ideal generated by the Jacobian of a function or function germ. Let O ( x 1 , â€¦ , x n ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}(x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n})} denote the ring of smooth functions in n {\\displaystyle n} variables and f {\\displaystyle f} a function in the ring.  The Jacobian ideal of f {\\displaystyle f} is","image":"0208a0327319a59a4053774628319ccd1afd0411.svg","url":"Jacobian_ideal"}
