{"title":"Norm variety","summary":"In mathematics, a norm variety is a particular type of algebraic variety V over a field F, introduced for the purposes of algebraic K-theory by Voevodsky. The idea is to relate Milnor K-theory of F to geometric objects V, having function fields F(V) that 'split' given 'symbols' (elements of Milnor K-groups).[1]","image":"bdff5be97431d1dc4129a2c64953b2910305f2bc.svg","url":"Norm_variety"}
