{"title":"Super-recursive algorithm","summary":"In computability theory, super-recursive algorithms are a generalization of ordinary algorithms that are more powerful, that is, compute more than Turing machines. The term was introduced by Mark Burgin, whose book \"Super-recursive algorithms\" develops their theory and presents several mathematical models. Turing machines and other mathematical models of conventional algorithms allow researchers to find properties of recursive algorithms and their computations. In a similar way, mathematical models of super-recursive algorithms, such as inductive Turing machines, allow researchers to find properties of super-recursive algorithms and their computations.","image":"e2647e336f34cacfba9934032137522052e8af0a.svg","url":"Super-recursive_algorithm"}
