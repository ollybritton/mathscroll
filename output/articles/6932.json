{"title":"Hartogs's theorem on separate holomorphicity","summary":"In mathematics, Hartogs's theorem is a fundamental result of Friedrich Hartogs in the theory of several complex variables. Roughly speaking, it states that a 'separately analytic' function is continuous. More precisely, if F : C n → C {\\displaystyle F:{\\textbf {C}}^{n}\\to {\\textbf {C}}} is a  function which is analytic in each variable zi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, while the other variables are held constant,  then F is a continuous function.","image":"84c4eda21a27b883d78a13a78a5bf1ca78acf00a.svg","url":"Hartogs's_theorem_on_separate_holomorphicity"}
