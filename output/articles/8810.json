{"title":"Koornwinder polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials (also called Koornwinder polynomials) are a family of orthogonal polynomials in several variables, introduced by Koornwinder (1992) and I. G. Macdonald (1987, important special cases), that generalize the Askey–Wilson polynomials.  They are the Macdonald polynomials attached to the non-reduced affine root system of type (C∨n, Cn), and in particular satisfy (van Diejen 1996, Sahi 1999) analogues of Macdonald's conjectures (Macdonald 2003, Chapter 5.3). In addition  Jan Felipe van Diejen showed that the Macdonald polynomials associated to any classical root system can be expressed as limits or special cases of Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials and found complete sets of concrete commuting difference operators diagonalized by them (van Diejen 1995). Furthermore, there is a large class of interesting families of multivariable orthogonal polynomials associated with classical root systems which are degenerate cases of the Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials (van Diejen 1999).  The Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials have also been studied with the aid of affine Hecke algebras (Noumi 1995, Sahi 1999, Macdonald 2003).","image":"a198067acc6562380d92207ab46e0321ce572df9.svg","url":"Koornwinder_polynomials"}
