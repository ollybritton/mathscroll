{"title":"Hyperbolic set","summary":"In dynamical systems theory, a subset Î› of a smooth manifold M is said to have a hyperbolic structure with respect to a smooth map f if its tangent bundle may be split into two invariant subbundles, one of which is contracting and the other is expanding under f, with respect to some Riemannian metric on M. An analogous definition applies to the case of flows.","image":"36ccde25e4d571ebadccd243f259468bf48824b1.svg","url":"Hyperbolic_set"}
