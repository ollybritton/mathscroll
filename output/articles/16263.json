{"title":"Two-body problem in general relativity","summary":"The two-body problem in general relativity is the determination of the motion and gravitational field of two bodies as described by the field equations of general relativity. Solving the Kepler problem is essential to calculate the bending of light by gravity and the motion of a planet orbiting its sun. Solutions are also used to describe the motion of binary stars around each other, and estimate their gradual loss of energy through gravitational radiation.","image":"Spacetime_lattice_analogy.svg.png.webp","url":"Two-body_problem_in_general_relativity"}
