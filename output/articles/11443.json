{"title":"Operator theory","summary":"In mathematics, operator theory is the study of linear operators on function spaces, beginning with differential operators and integral operators. The operators may be presented abstractly by their characteristics, such as bounded linear operators or closed operators, and consideration may be given to nonlinear operators. The study, which depends heavily on the topology of function spaces, is a branch of functional analysis.","image":"3ef144012b04ddf7d0c21b61126c9f6ac99ad6e7.svg","url":"Operator_theory"}
