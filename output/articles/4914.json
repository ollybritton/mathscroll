{"title":"Equidistributed sequence","summary":"In mathematics, a sequence (s1, s2, s3, ...) of real numbers is said to be equidistributed, or uniformly distributed, if the proportion of terms falling in a subinterval is proportional to the length of that subinterval.  Such sequences are studied in Diophantine approximation theory and have applications to Monte Carlo integration.","image":"fe6f70afa0d46e1ae8b430cc7f27ec976cbff0ea.svg","url":"Equidistributed_sequence"}
