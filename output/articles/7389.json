{"title":"Homotopy group with coefficients","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, for i ≥ 2 {\\displaystyle i\\geq 2} , the i-th homotopy group with coefficients in an abelian group G of a based space X is the pointed set of homotopy classes of based maps from the Moore space of type ( G , i ) {\\displaystyle (G,i)} to X, and is denoted by π i ( X ; G ) {\\displaystyle \\pi _{i}(X;G)} .[1] For i ≥ 3 {\\displaystyle i\\geq 3} , π i ( X ; G ) {\\displaystyle \\pi _{i}(X;G)} is a group. The groups π i ( X ; Z ) {\\displaystyle \\pi _{i}(X;\\mathbb {Z} )} are the usual homotopy groups of X.","image":"3aa8fcdf13fde4c390be2561ac45744d47a48cae.svg","url":"Homotopy_group_with_coefficients"}
