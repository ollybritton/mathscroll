{"title":"Subbase","summary":"In topology, a subbase (or subbasis, prebase, prebasis) for a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} with topology τ {\\displaystyle \\tau } is a subcollection B {\\displaystyle B} of τ {\\displaystyle \\tau } that generates τ , {\\displaystyle \\tau ,} in the sense that τ {\\displaystyle \\tau } is the smallest topology containing B {\\displaystyle B} as open sets. A slightly different definition is used by some authors, and there are other useful equivalent formulations of the definition; these are discussed below.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Subbase"}
