{"title":"(g,K)-module","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in the representation theory of reductive Lie groups, a ( g , K ) {\\displaystyle ({\\mathfrak {g}},K)} -module is an algebraic object, first introduced by Harish-Chandra,[1] used to deal with continuous infinite-dimensional representations using algebraic techniques. Harish-Chandra showed that the study of irreducible unitary representations of a real reductive Lie group, G, could be reduced to the study of irreducible ( g , K ) {\\displaystyle ({\\mathfrak {g}},K)} -modules, where g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} is the Lie algebra of G and K is a maximal compact subgroup of G.[2]","image":"fc413e0c6483c4923b796846b98ef2e3bbdb8efa.svg","url":"(g,K)-module"}
