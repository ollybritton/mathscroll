{"title":"Tangent circles","summary":"In geometry, tangent circles (also known as kissing circles) are circles in a common plane that intersect in a single point.  There are two types of tangency: internal and external.  Many problems and constructions in geometry are related to tangent circles; such problems often have real-life applications such as trilateration and maximizing the use of materials.","image":"Locus_of_centers_of_circles_tangent_to_two_circles.gif","url":"Tangent_circles"}
