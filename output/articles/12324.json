{"title":"Polyhedral space","summary":"Polyhedral space is a certain metric space. A (Euclidean) polyhedral space is a (usually finite) simplicial complex in which every simplex has a flat metric. (Other spaces of interest are spherical and hyperbolic polyhedral spaces, where every simplex has a metric of constant positive or negative curvature). In the sequel all polyhedral spaces are taken to be Euclidean polyhedral spaces.","image":"0ab2376f6a3a3b77ddc94ade4f6fbc96e85ca29b.svg","url":"Polyhedral_space"}
