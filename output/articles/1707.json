{"title":"Birotunda","summary":"In geometry, a birotunda is any member of a family of dihedral-symmetric polyhedra, formed from two rotunda adjoined through the largest face. They are similar to a bicupola but instead of alternating squares and triangles, it alternates pentagons and triangles around an axis. There are two forms, ortho- and gyro-: an orthobirotunda has one of the two rotundas is placed as the mirror reflection of the other, while in a gyrobirotunda one rotunda is twisted relative to the other.","image":"Pentagonal_orthobirotunda.png.webp","url":"Birotunda"}
