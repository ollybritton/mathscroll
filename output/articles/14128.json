{"title":"Semimartingale","summary":"In probability theory, a real valued stochastic process X is called a semimartingale if it can be decomposed as the sum of a local martingale and a càdlàg adapted finite-variation process. Semimartingales are \"good integrators\", forming the largest class of processes with respect to which the Itô integral and the Stratonovich integral can be defined.","image":"6a69e397f95fd1ced65988e125710255b7190d1f.svg","url":"Semimartingale"}
