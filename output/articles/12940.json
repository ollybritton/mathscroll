{"title":"Quasiregular element","summary":"In mathematics, specifically ring theory, the notion of quasiregularity provides a computationally convenient way to work with the Jacobson radical of a ring.[1] In this article, we primarily concern ourselves with the notion of quasiregularity for unital rings. However, one section is devoted to the theory of quasiregularity in non-unital rings, which constitutes an important aspect of noncommutative ring theory.","image":"41bef4d816b569982980d71101fbbbd1ff95ada3.svg","url":"Quasiregular_element"}
