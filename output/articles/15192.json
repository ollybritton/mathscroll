{"title":"Subgroup","summary":"In group theory, a branch of mathematics, given a group G under a binary operation ∗, a subset H of G is called a subgroup of G if H also forms a group under the operation ∗. More precisely, H is a subgroup of G if the restriction of ∗ to H × H is a group operation on H. This is often denoted H ≤ G, read as \"H is a subgroup of G\".","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Subgroup"}
