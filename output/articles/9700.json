{"title":"Loop (topology)","summary":"In mathematics, a loop in a topological space X is a continuous function f from the unit interval I = [0,1] to X such that f(0) = f(1). In other words, it is a path whose initial point is equal to its terminal point.[1]","image":"Fundamental_group_torus2.png.webp","url":"Loop_(topology)"}
