{"title":"Orthocentric system","summary":"In geometry, an orthocentric system is a set of four points on a plane, one of which is the orthocenter of the triangle formed by the other three. Equivalently, the lines passing through disjoint pairs among the points are perpendicular, and the four circles passing through any three of the four points have the same radius.[1]","image":"Orthosystem_SVG.svg.png.webp","url":"Orthocentric_system"}
