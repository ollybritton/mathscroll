{"title":"Exotic affine space","summary":"In algebraic geometry, an exotic affine space is a complex algebraic variety that is diffeomorphic to R 2 n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2n}} for some n, but is not isomorphic as an algebraic variety to C n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{n}} .[1][2][3]  An example of an exotic C 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{3}} is the Korasâ€“Russell cubic threefold,[4] which is the subset of C 4 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{4}} defined by the polynomial equation","image":"47460f1a92774729807be11cf62b9178b5771b4a.svg","url":"Exotic_affine_space"}
