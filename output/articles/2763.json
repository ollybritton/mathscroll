{"title":"Clique-width","summary":"In graph theory, the clique-width of a graph G is a parameter that describes the structural complexity of the graph; it is closely related to treewidth, but unlike treewidth it can be bounded even for dense graphs. It is defined as the minimum number of labels needed to construct G by means of the following 4 operationsÂ :","image":"59f3b7d78eab12e6e85e5f4f7461a9354ba18a45.svg","url":"Clique-width"}
