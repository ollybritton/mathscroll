{"title":"Kähler identities","summary":"In complex geometry, the Kähler identities are a collection of identities between operators on a Kähler manifold relating the Dolbeault operators and their adjoints, contraction and wedge operators of the Kähler form, and the Laplacians of the Kähler metric. The Kähler identities combine with results of Hodge theory to produce a number of relations on de Rham and Dolbeault cohomology of compact Kähler manifolds, such as the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the hard Lefschetz theorem, the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations, and the Hodge index theorem. They are also, again combined with Hodge theory, important in proving fundamental analytical results on Kähler manifolds, such as the ∂ ∂ ¯ {\\displaystyle \\partial {\\bar {\\partial }}} -lemma, the Nakano inequalities, and the Kodaira vanishing theorem.","image":"61471a2c013227ee2956b4a17932feebcdd39dca.svg","url":"Kähler_identities"}
