{"title":"Limit of distributions","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in the theory of generalized functions, the limit of a sequence of distributions is the distribution that sequence approaches. The distance, suitably quantified, to the limiting distribution can be made arbitrarily small by selecting a distribution sufficiently far along the sequence. This notion generalizes a limit of a sequence of functions; a limit as a distribution may exist when a limit of functions does not.","image":"65da883ca3d16b461e46c94777b0d9c4aa010e79.svg","url":"Limit_of_distributions"}
