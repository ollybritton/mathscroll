{"title":"Treynor–Black model","summary":"In Finance the Treynor–Black model is a mathematical model for security selection published by Fischer Black and Jack Treynor in 1973. The model assumes an investor who considers that most securities are priced efficiently, but who believes they have information that can be used to predict the abnormal performance (Alpha) of a few of them; the model finds the optimum portfolio to hold under such conditions.","image":"a37b38745fe8024a51d6efa011cae3a52bff8aae.svg","url":"Treynor–Black_model"}
