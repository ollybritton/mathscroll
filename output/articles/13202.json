{"title":"Recreational mathematics","summary":"Recreational mathematics is mathematics carried out for recreation (entertainment) rather than as a strictly research and application-based professional activity or as a part of a student's formal education. Although it is not necessarily limited to being an endeavor for amateurs, many topics in this field require no knowledge of advanced mathematics. Recreational mathematics involves mathematical puzzles and games, often appealing to children and untrained adults, inspiring their further study of the subject.[1]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Recreational_mathematics"}
