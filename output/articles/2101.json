{"title":"C-minimal theory","summary":"In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, a C-minimal theory is a theory that is  \"minimal\" with respect to a ternary relation C with certain properties. Algebraically closed fields with a (Krull) valuation are perhaps the most important example.","image":"ae8c8d585a05d0c18994950d72d19a32a5420d18.svg","url":"C-minimal_theory"}
