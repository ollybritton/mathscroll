{"title":"PPA (complexity)","summary":"In computational complexity theory, PPA is a complexity class, standing for \"Polynomial Parity Argument\" (on a graph). Introduced by Christos Papadimitriou in 1994[1] (page 528), PPA is a subclass of TFNP. It is a class of search problems that can be shown to be total by an application of the handshaking lemma: any undirected graph that has a vertex whose degree is an odd number must have some other vertex whose degree is an odd number. This observation means that if we are given a graph and an odd-degree vertex, and we are asked to find some other odd-degree vertex, then we are searching for something that is guaranteed to exist (so, we have a total search problem).","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"PPA_(complexity)"}
