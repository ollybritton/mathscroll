{"title":"Configuration space (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a configuration space is a construction closely related to state spaces or phase spaces in physics. In physics, these are used to describe the state of a whole system as a single point in a high-dimensional space. In mathematics, they are used to describe assignments of a collection of points to positions in a topological space. More specifically, configuration spaces in mathematics are particular examples of configuration spaces in physics in the particular case of several non-colliding particles.","image":"Moebius_Surface_1_Display_Small.png.webp","url":"Configuration_space_(mathematics)"}
