{"title":"Kronecker coefficient","summary":"In mathematics, Kronecker coefficients gλμν describe the decomposition of the tensor product (= Kronecker product) of two irreducible representations of a symmetric group into irreducible representations. They play an important role algebraic combinatorics and geometric complexity theory. They were introduced by Murnaghan in 1938.","image":"ff533f188d3b02590ae2d37c1014675c896db9d1.svg","url":"Kronecker_coefficient"}
