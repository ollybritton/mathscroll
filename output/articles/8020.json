{"title":"Ioan Mire Melik","summary":"Ioan Mire Melik, or Melic (born Iacob Ioan Miren Melik;[1] August 9, 1840 – January 29, 1889), was a Wallachian, later Romanian mathematician, educator and political figure, one of the early members of Junimea literary society. Known for his work in private education, and for his tenure at the University of Iași, he was the author of several early introductions to science—dealing with arithmetic and geometry, but also with topography and surveying. He was perceived as a bland figure at Junimea meetings, and had little to do with its literary agenda, but took care of administrative chores and, for a while, of its publishing venture.","image":"I._M._Melik_in_1873_ILR_440.jpg.webp","url":"Ioan_Mire_Melik"}
