{"title":"Fréchet algebra","summary":"In mathematics, especially functional analysis, a Fréchet algebra, named after Maurice René Fréchet, is an associative algebra A {\\displaystyle A} over the real or complex numbers that at the same time is also a (locally convex) Fréchet space. The multiplication operation ( a , b ) ↦ a ∗ b {\\displaystyle (a,b)\\mapsto a*b} for a , b ∈ A {\\displaystyle a,b\\in A} is required to be jointly continuous. If { ‖ ⋅ ‖ n } n = 0 ∞ {\\displaystyle \\{\\|\\cdot \\|_{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty }} is an increasing family[lower-alpha 1] of seminorms for the topology of A {\\displaystyle A} , the joint continuity of multiplication is equivalent to there being a constant C n > 0 {\\displaystyle C_{n}>0} and integer m ≥ n {\\displaystyle m\\geq n} for each n {\\displaystyle n} such that ‖ a b ‖ n ≤ C n ‖ a ‖ m ‖ b ‖ m {\\displaystyle \\left\\|ab\\right\\|_{n}\\leq C_{n}\\left\\|a\\right\\|_{m}\\left\\|b\\right\\|_{m}} for all a , b ∈ A {\\displaystyle a,b\\in A} .[lower-alpha 2] Fréchet algebras are also called B0-algebras.[1]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Fréchet_algebra"}
