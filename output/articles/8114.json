{"title":"Itô diffusion","summary":"In mathematics – specifically, in stochastic analysis – an Itô diffusion is a solution to a specific type of stochastic differential equation. That equation is similar to the Langevin equation used in physics to describe the Brownian motion of a particle subjected to a potential in a viscous fluid.  Itô diffusions are named after the Japanese mathematician Kiyosi Itô.","image":"Wiener_process_3d.png.webp","url":"Itô_diffusion"}
