{"title":"Rank correlation","summary":"In statistics, a rank correlation is any of several statistics that measure an ordinal association—the relationship between rankings of different ordinal variables or different rankings of the same variable, where a \"ranking\" is the assignment of the ordering labels \"first\", \"second\", \"third\", etc. to different observations of a particular variable.  A rank correlation coefficient measures the degree of similarity between two rankings, and can be used to assess the significance of the relation between them.  For example, two common nonparametric methods of significance that use rank correlation are the Mann–Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.","image":"38a7dcde9730ef0853809fefc18d88771f95206c.svg","url":"Rank_correlation"}
