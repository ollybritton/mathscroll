{"title":"TOPSIS","summary":"The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a multi-criteria decision analysis method, which was originally developed by Ching-Lai Hwang and Yoon in 1981[1] with further developments by Yoon in 1987,[2] and Hwang, Lai and Liu in 1993.[3] TOPSIS is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the longest geometric distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS). A dedicated book in the fuzzy context was published in 2021 [4]","image":"a27e97949cb2cc8f2d4c2a9421477a65f839db11.svg","url":"TOPSIS"}
