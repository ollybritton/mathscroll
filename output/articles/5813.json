{"title":"Fulton–Hansen connectedness theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Fulton–Hansen connectedness theorem is a result from intersection theory in algebraic geometry, for the case of subvarieties of projective space with codimension large enough to make the intersection have components of dimension at least 1.  It is named after William Fulton and Johan Hansen, who proved it in 1979.","image":"65e7034e627843060c45a4f153eb9bc141fee5d1.svg","url":"Fulton–Hansen_connectedness_theorem"}
