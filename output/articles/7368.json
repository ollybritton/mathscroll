{"title":"Homology (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, homology[1] is a general way of associating a sequence of algebraic objects, such as abelian groups or modules, with other mathematical objects such as topological spaces.  Homology groups were originally defined in algebraic topology.  Similar constructions are available in a wide variety of other contexts, such as abstract algebra, groups, Lie algebras, Galois theory, and algebraic geometry.","image":"60796c8d0c03cf575637d3202463b214d9635880.svg","url":"Homology_(mathematics)"}
