{"title":"Direct sum","summary":"The direct sum is an operation between structures in abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics.  It is defined differently, but analogously, for different kinds of structures. To see how the direct sum is used in abstract algebra, consider a more elementary kind of structure, the abelian group.  The direct sum of two abelian groups A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} is another abelian group A ⊕ B {\\displaystyle A\\oplus B} consisting of the ordered pairs ( a , b ) {\\displaystyle (a,b)} where a ∈ A {\\displaystyle a\\in A} and b ∈ B {\\displaystyle b\\in B} . To add ordered pairs, we define the sum ( a , b ) + ( c , d ) {\\displaystyle (a,b)+(c,d)} to be ( a + c , b + d ) {\\displaystyle (a+c,b+d)} ; in other words addition is defined coordinate-wise. For example, the direct sum R ⊕ R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} \\oplus \\mathbb {R} } , where R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } is real coordinate space, is the Cartesian plane, R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} . A similar process can be used to form the direct sum of two vector spaces or two modules.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Direct_sum"}
