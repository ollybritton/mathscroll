{"title":"Relaxation (approximation)","summary":"In mathematical optimization and related fields, relaxation is a modeling strategy.  A relaxation is an approximation of a difficult problem by a nearby problem that is easier to solve. A solution of the relaxed problem provides information about the original problem.","image":"65e03a703ef1e42a804c9355a31fc1817973b2da.svg","url":"Relaxation_(approximation)"}
