{"title":"Rodger's method","summary":"Rodger's method is a statistical procedure for examining research data post hoc following an 'omnibus' analysis (e.g., after an analysis of variance – anova).  The various components of this methodology were fully worked out by R. S. Rodger in the 1960s and 70s, and seven of his articles about it were published in the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology between 1967 and 1978.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]","image":"Wikiversity_logo_2017.svg.png.webp","url":"Rodger's_method"}
