{"title":"Cantellation (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a cantellation is a 2nd-order truncation in any dimension that bevels a regular polytope at its edges and at its vertices, creating a new facet in place of each edge and of each vertex. Cantellation also applies to regular tilings and honeycombs. Cantellating a polyhedron is also rectifying its rectification.","image":"Small_rhombicuboctahedron.png.webp","url":"Cantellation_(geometry)"}
