{"title":"Dimension of a scheme","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the dimension of a scheme is a generalization of a dimension of an algebraic variety. Scheme theory emphasizes the relative point of view and, accordingly, the relative dimension of a morphism of schemes is also important.","image":"971bbf839438986b934ece4ef49f7686935e079c.svg","url":"Dimension_of_a_scheme"}
