{"title":"Independent set (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, an independent set, stable set, coclique or anticlique is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. That is, it is a set S {\\displaystyle S} of vertices such that for every two vertices in S {\\displaystyle S} , there is no edge connecting the two. Equivalently, each edge in the graph has at most one endpoint in S {\\displaystyle S} . A set is independent if and only if it is a clique in the graph's complement. The size of an independent set is the number of vertices it contains. Independent sets have also been called \"internally stable sets\", of which \"stable set\" is a shortening.[1]","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Independent_set_(graph_theory)"}
