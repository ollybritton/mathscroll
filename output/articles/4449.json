{"title":"Double negation","summary":"In propositional logic, double negation is the theorem that states that \"If a statement is true, then it is not the case that the statement is not true.\" This is expressed by saying that a proposition A is logically equivalent to not (not-A), or by the formula A ≡ ~(~A) where the sign ≡ expresses logical equivalence and the sign ~ expresses negation.[1]","image":"28e32df56cc3e2ae93468149a762ce096a12e61f.svg","url":"Double_negation"}
