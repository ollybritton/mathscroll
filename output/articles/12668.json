{"title":"Property testing","summary":"In computer science, a property testing algorithm for a decision problem is an algorithm whose query complexity to its input is much smaller than the instance size of the problem.  Typically property testing algorithms are used to distinguish if some combinatorial structure S (such as a graph or a boolean function) satisfies some property P, or is \"far\" from having this property (meaning an Îµ-fraction of the representation of S need be modified in order to make S satisfy P), using only a small number of \"local\" queries to the object.
