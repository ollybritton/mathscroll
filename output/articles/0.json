{"title":"(2+1)-dimensional topological gravity","summary":"In two spatial and one time dimensions, general relativity turns out to have no propagating gravitational degrees of freedom. In fact, it can be shown that in a vacuum, spacetime will always be locally flat (or de Sitter or anti-de Sitter depending upon the cosmological constant). This makes (2+1)-dimensional topological gravity (2+1D topological gravity) a topological theory with no gravitational local degrees of freedom.","image":"d5770e319831be7418ac401c7fa09f5e1828e23e.svg","url":"(2+1)-dimensional_topological_gravity"}
