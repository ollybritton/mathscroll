{"title":"Non-autonomous system (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, an autonomous system is a dynamic equation on a smooth manifold. A non-autonomous system is a dynamic equation on a smooth fiber bundle Q â†’ R {\\displaystyle Q\\to \\mathbb {R} } over R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } . For instance, this is the case of non-autonomous mechanics.","image":"a46144cc91a453df7fadc4e92a8cd9d40f5b02e0.svg","url":"Non-autonomous_system_(mathematics)"}
