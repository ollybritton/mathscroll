{"title":"Spectrum of a theory","summary":"In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, the spectrum of a theory is given by the number of isomorphism classes of models in various cardinalities. More precisely, for any complete theory T in a  language we write I(T, κ) for the number of models of T (up to isomorphism) of cardinality κ. The spectrum problem is to describe the possible behaviors of I(T, κ) as a function of κ. It has been almost completely solved for the case of a countable theory T.","image":"4ac4be7ea31102049532b174a64f029f53bbec9d.svg","url":"Spectrum_of_a_theory"}
