{"title":"Simple module","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in ring theory, the simple modules over a ring R are the (left or right) modules over R that are non-zero and have no non-zero proper submodules.  Equivalently, a module M is simple if and only if every cyclic submodule generated by a non-zero element of M equals M.  Simple modules form building blocks for the modules of finite length, and they are analogous to the simple groups in group theory.","image":"47e08d45977d8e38c03be339f9f16209d229d84d.svg","url":"Simple_module"}
