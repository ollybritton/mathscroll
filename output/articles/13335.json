{"title":"Regular space","summary":"In topology and related fields of mathematics, a topological space X is called a regular space if every closed subset C of X and a point p not contained in C admit non-overlapping open neighborhoods.[1] Thus p and C can be separated by neighborhoods. This condition is known as Axiom T3. The term \"T3 space\" usually means \"a regular Hausdorff space\". These conditions are examples of separation axioms.","image":"Regular_space.svg.png.webp","url":"Regular_space"}
