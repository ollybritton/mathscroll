{"title":"Tensor (intrinsic definition)","summary":"In mathematics, the modern component-free approach to the theory of a tensor views a tensor as an abstract object, expressing some definite type of multilinear concept. Their  properties can be derived from their definitions, as linear maps or more generally; and the rules for manipulations of tensors arise as an extension of linear algebra to multilinear algebra.","image":"b51cd6d35926dedc4a0bf248185a6dfed38aaacd.svg","url":"Tensor_(intrinsic_definition)"}
