{"title":"Semisimple module","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra known as module theory, a semisimple module or completely reducible module is a type of module that can be understood easily from its parts.  A ring that is a semisimple module over itself is known as an Artinian semisimple ring.  Some important rings, such as group rings of finite groups over fields of characteristic zero, are semisimple rings.  An Artinian ring is initially understood via its largest semisimple quotient.  The structure of Artinian semisimple rings is well understood by the Artinâ€“Wedderburn theorem, which exhibits these rings as finite direct products of matrix rings.","image":"efa1186c5830a983b381f6382c8d0bb8a11d3a32.svg","url":"Semisimple_module"}
