{"title":"Cut (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, a cut is a partition of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets.[1] Any cut determines a cut-set, the set of edges that have one endpoint in each subset of the partition. These edges are said to cross the cut. In a connected graph, each cut-set determines a unique cut, and in some cases cuts are identified with their cut-sets rather than with their vertex partitions.","image":"Min-cut.svg.png.webp","url":"Cut_(graph_theory)"}
