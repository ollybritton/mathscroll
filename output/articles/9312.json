{"title":"Limit ordinal","summary":"In set theory, a limit ordinal is an ordinal number that is neither zero nor a successor ordinal. Alternatively, an ordinal λ is a limit ordinal if there is an ordinal less than λ, and whenever β is an ordinal less than λ, then there exists an ordinal γ such that β < γ < λ. Every ordinal number is either zero, or a successor ordinal, or a limit ordinal.","image":"Omega-exp-omega-labeled.svg.png.webp","url":"Limit_ordinal"}
