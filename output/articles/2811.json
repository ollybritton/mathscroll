{"title":"Cobordism","summary":"In mathematics, cobordism is a fundamental  equivalence relation on the class of compact manifolds of the same dimension, set up using the concept of the boundary (French bord, giving cobordism) of a manifold. Two manifolds of the same dimension are cobordant if their disjoint union is the boundary of a compact manifold one dimension higher.","image":"Cobordism.svg.png.webp","url":"Cobordism"}
