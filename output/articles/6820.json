{"title":"Hall algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the Hall algebra is an associative algebra with a basis corresponding to isomorphism classes of finite abelian p-groups. It was first discussed by Steinitz (1901) but forgotten until it was rediscovered by Philip HallÂ (1959), both of whom published no more than brief summaries of their work. The Hall polynomials are the structure constants of  the Hall algebra. The Hall algebra plays an important role in the theory of Masaki Kashiwara and George Lusztig regarding canonical bases in quantum groups. Ringel (1990) generalized Hall algebras to more general categories, such as the category of representations of a quiver.","image":"4921d490ba7a5a5bef90b427a629e38c0138c243.svg","url":"Hall_algebra"}
