{"title":"Deformed Hermitian Yang–Mills equation","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical physics, and especially gauge theory, the deformed Hermitian Yang–Mills (dHYM) equation is a differential equation describing the equations of motion for a D-brane in the B-model (commonly called a B-brane) of string theory. The equation was derived by Mariño-Minasian-Moore-Strominger[1] in the case of Abelian gauge group (the unitary group U ⁡ ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {U} (1)} ), and by Leung–Yau–Zaslow[2] using mirror symmetry from the corresponding equations of motion for D-branes in the A-model of string theory.","image":"39823af285de3e72d7d50f96fe5b8ba024017af2.svg","url":"Deformed_Hermitian_Yang–Mills_equation"}
