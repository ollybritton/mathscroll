{"title":"Conditional independence","summary":"In probability theory, conditional independence describes situations wherein an observation is irrelevant or redundant when evaluating the certainty of a hypothesis. Conditional independence is usually formulated in terms of conditional probability, as a special case where the probability of the hypothesis given the uninformative observation is equal to the probability without. If A {\\displaystyle A} is the hypothesis, and B {\\displaystyle B} and C {\\displaystyle C} are observations, conditional independence can be stated as an equality:","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Conditional_independence"}
