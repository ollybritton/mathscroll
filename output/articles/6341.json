{"title":"Gnome sort","summary":"Gnome sort (nicknamed stupid sort) is a variation of the insertion sort sorting algorithm that does not use nested loops. Gnome sort was originally proposed by Iranian computer scientist Hamid Sarbazi-Azad (professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Sharif University of Technology)[1] in 2000. The sort was first called stupid sort[2] (not to be confused with bogosort), and then later described by Dick Grune and named gnome sort.[3]","image":"Visualization_of_Gnome_sort.gif","url":"Gnome_sort"}
