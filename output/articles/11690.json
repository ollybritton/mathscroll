{"title":"p-variation","summary":"In mathematical analysis, p-variation is a collection of seminorms on functions from an ordered set to a metric space, indexed by a real number p ≥ 1 {\\displaystyle p\\geq 1} . p-variation is a measure of the regularity or smoothness of a function. Specifically, if f : I → ( M , d ) {\\displaystyle f:I\\to (M,d)} , where ( M , d ) {\\displaystyle (M,d)} is a metric space and I a totally ordered set, its p-variation is","image":"cf93c1353080a21b276e79058d82c19c40310653.svg","url":"P-variation"}
