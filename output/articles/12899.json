{"title":"Quasi-analytic function","summary":"In mathematics, a quasi-analytic class of functions is a generalization of the class of real analytic functions based upon the following fact: If f is an analytic function on an interval [a,b] ⊂ R, and at some point f and all of its derivatives are zero, then f is identically zero on all of [a,b]. Quasi-analytic classes are broader classes of functions for which this statement still holds true.","image":"e0c531edd4d521fc8634fd39c8603f6c8faaf3be.svg","url":"Quasi-analytic_function"}
