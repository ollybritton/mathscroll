{"title":"Different ideal","summary":"In algebraic number theory, the different ideal (sometimes simply the different) is defined to measure the (possible) lack of duality in the ring of integers of an algebraic number field K, with respect to the field trace.  It then encodes the ramification data for prime ideals of the ring of integers. It was introduced by Richard Dedekind in 1882.[1][2]","image":"dc2fbae87c2274f5e3c94e5bdad6253bae4f99d3.svg","url":"Different_ideal"}
