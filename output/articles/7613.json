{"title":"Ideal class group","summary":"In number theory, the ideal class group (or class group) of an  algebraic number field K is the quotient group JK/PK where JK is the group of fractional ideals of the ring of integers of K, and PK is its subgroup of principal ideals. The class group is a measure of the extent to which unique factorization fails in the ring of integers of K. The order of the group, which is finite, is called the class number of K.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Ideal_class_group"}
