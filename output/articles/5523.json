{"title":"Flatness (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, the flatness (symbol: ‚è•) of a surface is the degree to which it approximates a mathematical plane. The term is often generalized for higher-dimensional manifolds to describe the degree to which they approximate the Euclidean space of the same dimensionality. (See curvature.)[1]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Flatness_(mathematics)"}
