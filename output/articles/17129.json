{"title":"Zariski surface","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics, a Zariski surface is a surface over a field of characteristic p > 0 such that there is a dominant inseparable map of degree p from the projective plane to the surface. In particular, all Zariski surfaces are unirational. They were named by Piotr Blass in 1977 after Oscar Zariski who used them in 1958 to give examples of unirational surfaces in characteristic p > 0 that are not rational. (In characteristic 0 by contrast, Castelnuovo's theorem implies that all unirational surfaces are rational.)","image":"1c992ef116afba8cf650cc49d9ae068ac9284083.svg","url":"Zariski_surface"}
