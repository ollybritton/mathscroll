{"title":"Chirality (mathematics)","summary":"In geometry, a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it is not identical to its mirror image, or, more precisely, if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by rotations and translations alone. An object that is not chiral is said to be achiral.","image":"2_parallel_footprints.png.webp","url":"Chirality_(mathematics)"}
