{"title":"History of Maxwell's equations","summary":"In the beginning of the 19th century, many experimental and theoretical works had been accomplished in the understanding of electromagnetics. In the 1780s, Coulomb's law of electrostatics had been established. In 1825, Ampère published his Ampère's law. Michael Faraday discovered the electromagnetic induction through his experiments and conceptually, he emphasized the lines of forces in this electromagnetic induction. In 1834, Lenz solved the problem of the direction of the induction, and Neumann wrote down the equation to calculate the induced force by change of magnetic flux. However, these experimental results and rules were not well organized and sometimes confusing to scientists. A comprehensive summary of the electrodynamic principles was in urgent need at that time.","image":"VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png.webp","url":"History_of_Maxwell's_equations"}
