{"title":"Operation Reduction for Low Power","summary":"Operation Reduction for Low Power is an ASIC Program transformation technique used to reduce the power consumed by a specific application. A program transformation is any operation that changes the computational structure such as nature and type of computational models, their interconnections, sequencing of operations keeping the input output behavior intact. We basically use Operation reduction to reduce the number of operations to be done to perform a task which reduces the hardware required and in turn power consumption. For example, in a given Application specific IC reducing the number of independent additions required automatically reduces the adders required and also the power consumed.","image":"43eac8f70a4bec8678fce733a61fddcb05c26a58.svg","url":"Operation_Reduction_for_Low_Power"}
