{"title":"Binomial regression","summary":"In statistics, binomial regression is a regression analysis technique in which the response (often referred to as Y) has a binomial distribution: it is the number of successes in a series of n {\\displaystyle n} independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has probability of success p {\\displaystyle p} .[1] In binomial regression, the probability of a success is related to explanatory variables: the corresponding concept in ordinary regression is to relate the mean value of the unobserved response to explanatory variables.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Binomial_regression"}
