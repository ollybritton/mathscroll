{"title":"Special cases of Apollonius' problem","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, Apollonius' problem is to construct all the circles that are tangent to three given circles.  Special cases of Apollonius' problem are those in which at least one of the given circles is a point or line, i.e., is a circle of zero or infinite radius.  The nine types of such limiting cases of Apollonius' problem are to construct the circles tangent to:","image":"23665bddeb818ae0ae73d447f88a16ef8b22a988.svg","url":"Special_cases_of_Apollonius'_problem"}
