{"title":"Communication theory","summary":"Communication theory is a proposed description of communication phenomena, the relationships among them, a storyline describing these relationships, and an argument for these three elements. Communication theory provides a way of talking about and analyzing key events, processes, and commitments that together form communication. Theory can be seen as a way to map the world and make it navigable; communication theory gives us tools to answer empirical, conceptual, or practical communication questions.[1]","image":"Pioneer_plaque_(transparent).svg.png.webp","url":"Communication_theory"}
