{"title":"Stars and bars (combinatorics)","summary":"In the context of combinatorial mathematics, stars and bars (also called \"sticks and stones\",[1] \"balls and bars\",[2] and \"dots and dividers\"[3]) is a graphical aid for deriving certain combinatorial theorems. It was popularized by William Feller in his classic book on probability. It can be used to solve many simple counting problems, such as how many ways there are to put n indistinguishable balls into k distinguishable bins.[4]","image":"765c6b9d74bd9387c28abc8b3cc003fbfed9698b.svg","url":"Stars_and_bars_(combinatorics)"}
