{"title":"Sylvester matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a Sylvester matrix is a matrix associated to two univariate polynomials with coefficients in a field or a commutative ring. The entries of the Sylvester matrix of two polynomials are coefficients of the polynomials. The determinant of the Sylvester matrix of two polynomials is their resultant, which is zero when the two polynomials have a common root (in case of coefficients in a field) or a non-constant common divisor (in case of coefficients in an integral domain).","image":"c6d53ca7b76a15c00f06eb5fe7baf75b011bc0c4.svg","url":"Sylvester_matrix"}
