{"title":"Parabolic geometry (differential geometry)","summary":"In differential geometry and the study of Lie groups, a parabolic geometry is a homogeneous space G/P which is the quotient of a semisimple Lie group G by a parabolic subgroup P.  More generally, the curved analogs of a parabolic geometry in this sense is also called a parabolic geometry: any geometry that is modeled on such a space by means of a Cartan connection.","image":"0633f2f1caa79e9deb8cf6da3b60b0e97c5ee303.svg","url":"Parabolic_geometry_(differential_geometry)"}
