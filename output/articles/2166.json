{"title":"Canonical form","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, a canonical, normal, or standard form of a mathematical object is a standard way of presenting that object as a mathematical expression. Often, it is one which provides the simplest representation of an object and allows it to be identified in a unique way. The distinction between \"canonical\" and \"normal\" forms varies from subfield to subfield. In most fields, a canonical form specifies a unique representation for every object, while a normal form simply specifies its form, without the requirement of uniqueness.[1]","image":"Anagram_canonical_svg.svg.png.webp","url":"Canonical_form"}
