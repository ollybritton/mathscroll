{"title":"Kontsevich invariant","summary":"In the mathematical theory of knots, the Kontsevich invariant, also known as the Kontsevich integral[1] of an oriented framed link, is a universal Vassiliev invariant[2] in the sense that any coefficient of the Kontsevich invariant is of a finite type, and conversely any finite type invariant can be presented as a linear combination of such coefficients. It was defined by Maxim Kontsevich.","image":"JacobiDiag.png.webp","url":"Kontsevich_invariant"}
