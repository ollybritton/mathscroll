{"title":"Decision EXpert","summary":"DEX (Decision EXpert) is a qualitative multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method for decision making and is implemented in DEX software.[1] This method was developed by a research team led by Bohanec, Bratko, and Rajkovič.[2] The method supports decision makers in making complex decisions based on multiple, possibly conflicting, attributes. In DEX, all attributes are qualitative and can take values represented by words, such as “low” or “excellent”. Attributes are generally organized in a hierarchy. The evaluation of decision alternatives is carried out by utility functions, which are represented in the form of decision rules. All attributes (function arguments and outcomes) are assumed to be discrete. Additionally, they can be preferentially ordered, so that a higher ordinal value represents a better preference.","image":"DEXi_tree.png.webp","url":"Decision_EXpert"}
