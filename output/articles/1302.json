{"title":"Banach–Alaoglu theorem","summary":"In functional analysis and related branches of mathematics, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem (also known as Alaoglu's theorem) states that the closed unit ball of the dual space of a normed vector space is compact in the weak* topology.[1] A common proof identifies the unit ball with the weak-* topology as a closed subset of a product of compact sets with the product topology. As a consequence of Tychonoff's theorem, this product, and hence the unit ball within, is compact.","image":"d8e4f44fa2823fcdffc5fc26981c0d4fa57cade9.svg","url":"Banach–Alaoglu_theorem"}
