{"title":"Free product of associative algebras","summary":"In algebra, the free product (coproduct) of a family of associative algebras A i , i ∈ I {\\displaystyle A_{i},i\\in I} over a commutative ring R is the associative algebra over R that is, roughly, defined by the generators and the relations of the A i {\\displaystyle A_{i}} 's. The free product of two algebras A, B is denoted by A ∗ B. The notion is a ring-theoretic analog of a free product of groups.","image":"b3cc7eb13321ee4686530d7ca34936ce6f9db6ff.svg","url":"Free_product_of_associative_algebras"}
