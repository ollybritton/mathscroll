{"title":"Quasi-bialgebra","summary":"In mathematics, quasi-bialgebras are a generalization of bialgebras: they were first defined by the Ukrainian mathematician Vladimir Drinfeld in 1990. A quasi-bialgebra differs from a bialgebra by having coassociativity replaced by an invertible element Î¦ {\\displaystyle \\Phi } which controls the non-coassociativity. One of their key properties is that the corresponding category of modules forms a tensor category.","image":"aed80a2011a3912b028ba32a52dfa57165455f24.svg","url":"Quasi-bialgebra"}
