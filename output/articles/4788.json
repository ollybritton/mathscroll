{"title":"Elongated square gyrobicupola","summary":"In geometry, the elongated square gyrobicupola or pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron is one of the Johnson solids (J37). It is not usually considered to be an Archimedean solid, even though its faces consist of regular polygons that meet in the same pattern at each of its vertices, because unlike the 13 Archimedean solids, it lacks a set of global symmetries that map every vertex to every other vertex (though Gr√ºnbaum has suggested it should be added to the traditional list of Archimedean solids as a 14th example). It strongly resembles, but should not be mistaken for, the rhombicuboctahedron, which is an Archimedean solid. It is also a canonical polyhedron.","image":"Elongated_square_gyrobicupola.png.webp","url":"Elongated_square_gyrobicupola"}
