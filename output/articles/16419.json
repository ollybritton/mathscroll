{"title":"Unitary transformation (quantum mechanics)","summary":"In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation describes how a system changes with time. It does this by relating changes in the state of system to the energy in the system (given by an operator called the Hamiltonian). Therefore, once the Hamiltonian is known, the time dynamics are in principle known. All that remains is to plug the Hamiltonian into the Schrödinger equation and solve for the system state as a function of time.[1][2]","image":"9d1b6c8837aed2794e7b52afa88ad371f1d275fa.svg","url":"Unitary_transformation_(quantum_mechanics)"}
