{"title":"Homotopy Lie algebra","summary":"In mathematics, in particular abstract algebra and topology, a homotopy Lie algebra (or L ∞ {\\displaystyle L_{\\infty }} -algebra) is a generalisation of the concept of a differential graded Lie algebra. To be a little more specific, the Jacobi identity only holds up to homotopy. Therefore, a differential graded Lie algebra can be seen as a homotopy Lie algebra where the Jacobi identity holds on the nose. These homotopy algebras are useful in classifying deformation problems over characteristic 0 in deformation theory because deformation functors are classified by quasi-isomorphism classes of L ∞ {\\displaystyle L_{\\infty }} -algebras.[1] This was later extended to all characteristics by Jonathan Pridham.[2]","image":"a5ecf05fae003abbd91bc8c749d5a8a807d6efd8.svg","url":"Homotopy_Lie_algebra"}
