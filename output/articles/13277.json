{"title":"Reflected Brownian motion","summary":"In probability theory, reflected Brownian motion (or regulated Brownian motion,[1][2] both with the acronym RBM) is a Wiener process in a space with reflecting boundaries.[3]  In the physical literature, this process describes diffusion in a confined space and it is often called confined Brownian motion. For example it can describe the motion of hard spheres in water confined between two walls.[4]","image":"211d99435f22086c918480751cde3b7b8990ebdd.svg","url":"Reflected_Brownian_motion"}
