{"title":"Graph center","summary":"The center (or Jordan center[1]) of a graph is the set of all vertices of minimum eccentricity,[2] that is, the set of all vertices u where the greatest distance d(u,v) to other vertices v is minimal.  Equivalently, it is the set of vertices with eccentricity equal to the graph's radius.[3] Thus vertices in the center (central points) minimize the maximal distance from other points in the graph.","image":"Graphcenter.svg.png.webp","url":"Graph_center"}
