{"title":"Multicomplex number","summary":"In mathematics, the multicomplex number systems C n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} _{n}} are defined inductively as follows: Let C0 be the real number system. For every n > 0 let in be a square root of −1, that is, an imaginary unit. Then C n + 1 = { z = x + y i n + 1 : x , y ∈ C n } {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} _{n+1}=\\lbrace z=x+yi_{n+1}:x,y\\in \\mathbb {C} _{n}\\rbrace } . In the multicomplex number systems one also requires that i n i m = i m i n {\\displaystyle i_{n}i_{m}=i_{m}i_{n}} (commutativity). Then C 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} _{1}} is the complex number system, C 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} _{2}} is the bicomplex number system, C 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} _{3}} is the tricomplex number system of Corrado Segre, and C n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} _{n}} is the multicomplex number system of order n.","image":"bee8911130cf903427170b181b9f74dbf9346547.svg","url":"Multicomplex_number"}
