{"title":"Kruskal–Katona theorem","summary":"In algebraic combinatorics, the Kruskal–Katona theorem gives a complete characterization of the f-vectors of abstract simplicial complexes. It includes as a special case the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem and can be restated in terms of uniform hypergraphs. It is named after Joseph Kruskal and Gyula O. H. Katona, but has been independently discovered by several others.","image":"59ad05db9425118e8d391fd9cafe2b8cf66aa046.svg","url":"Kruskal–Katona_theorem"}
