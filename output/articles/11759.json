{"title":"Parabiaugmented dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the parabiaugmented dodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (J59). It can be seen as a dodecahedron with two pentagonal pyramids (J2) attached to opposite faces. When pyramids are attached to a dodecahedron in other ways, they may result in an augmented dodecahedron (J58), a metabiaugmented dodecahedron (J60), a triaugmented dodecahedron (J61), or even a pentakis dodecahedron if the faces are made to be irregular.","image":"Parabiaugmented_dodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Parabiaugmented_dodecahedron"}
