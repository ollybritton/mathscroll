{"title":"Bernstein–Kushnirenko theorem","summary":"The Bernstein–Kushnirenko theorem (or Bernstein–Khovanskii–Kushnirenko (BKK) theorem [1]), proven by David Bernstein[2] and Anatoliy Kushnirenko[3] in 1975, is a theorem in algebra. It states that the number of non-zero complex solutions of a system of Laurent polynomial equations f 1 = ⋯ = f n = 0 {\\displaystyle f_{1}=\\cdots =f_{n}=0} is equal to the mixed volume of the Newton polytopes of the polynomials f 1 , … , f n {\\displaystyle f_{1},\\ldots ,f_{n}} , assuming that all non-zero coefficients of f n {\\displaystyle f_{n}} are generic. A more precise statement is as follows:","image":"b9e8cfd3d2a3b8a9c2e386e44551ddf732374578.svg","url":"Bernstein–Kushnirenko_theorem"}
