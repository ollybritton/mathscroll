{"title":"Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging","summary":"Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) is a specific type of magnetic resonance imaging used primarily to determine flow velocities. PC-MRI can be considered a method of Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry. It also provides a method of magnetic resonance angiography. Since modern PC-MRI is typically time-resolved, it provides a means of 4D imaging (three spatial dimensions plus time).[2]","image":"Vastly_undersampled_Isotropic_Projection_Reconstruction_(VIPR)_Phase_Contrast_(PC)_sequence_MRI_of_arterial_dissections.jpg.webp","url":"Phase_contrast_magnetic_resonance_imaging"}
