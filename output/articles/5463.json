{"title":"Finsler's lemma","summary":"Finsler's lemma is a mathematical result named after Paul Finsler.  It states equivalent ways to express the positive definiteness of a quadratic form Q constrained by a linear form L. Since it is equivalent to another lemmas used in optimization and control theory, such as Yakubovich's S-lemma,[1] Finsler's lemma has been given many proofs and has been widely used, particularly in results related to robust optimization and linear matrix inequalities.","image":"68e755c24c7f805fbf806b74ef5b01a3bf3c0ebf.svg","url":"Finsler's_lemma"}
