{"title":"Sperner family","summary":"In combinatorics, a Sperner family (or Sperner system; named in honor of Emanuel Sperner), or clutter, is a family F of subsets of a finite set E in which none of the sets contains another.  Equivalently, a Sperner family is an antichain in the inclusion lattice over the power set of E.  A Sperner family is also sometimes called an independent system or irredundant set.","image":"92fb2ef98b981acd546e7bf4ddafc42cea34d1cf.svg","url":"Sperner_family"}
