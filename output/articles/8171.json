{"title":"Jacobian variety","summary":"In mathematics, the Jacobian variety J(C) of a non-singular algebraic curve C of genus g is the moduli space of degree 0 line bundles. It is the connected component of the identity in the Picard group of C, hence an abelian variety.","image":"9b5f223d670027d1ab1596db1fce4c457f489f9f.svg","url":"Jacobian_variety"}
