{"title":"Function field sieve","summary":"In mathematics the Function Field Sieve is one of the most efficient algorithms to solve the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) in a finite field. It has heuristic subexponential complexity. Leonard Adleman developed it in 1994 [1] and then elaborated it together with M. D. Huang in 1999.[2] Previous work includes the work of D. Coppersmith [3] about the DLP in fields of characteristic two.","image":"009ac5470a4ecd0afab8866426ad920c494316c9.svg","url":"Function_field_sieve"}
