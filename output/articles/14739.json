{"title":"Spectral geometry","summary":"Spectral geometry is a field in mathematics which concerns relationships between geometric structures of manifolds and spectra of canonically defined differential operators. The case of the Laplaceâ€“Beltrami operator on a closed Riemannian manifold has been most intensively studied, although other Laplace operators in differential geometry have also been examined.  The field concerns itself with two kinds of questions: direct problems and inverse problems.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Spectral_geometry"}
