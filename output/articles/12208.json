{"title":"Plate trick","summary":"In mathematics and physics, the plate trick, also known as  Dirac's string trick,  the belt trick, or the Balinese cup trick, is any of several demonstrations of the idea that rotating an object with strings attached to it by 360 degrees does not return the system to its original state, while a second rotation of 360 degrees, a total rotation of 720 degrees, does.[1] Mathematically, it is a demonstration of the theorem that SU(2) (which double-covers SO(3)) is simply connected. To say that SU(2) double-covers SO(3) essentially means that the unit quaternions represent the group of rotations twice over.[1] A detailed, intuitive, yet semi-formal articulation can be found in the article on tangloids.","image":"Belt_GÃ¼rtel.jpg.webp","url":"Plate_trick"}
