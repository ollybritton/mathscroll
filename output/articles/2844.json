{"title":"Coherent sheaf","summary":"In mathematics, especially in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds, coherent sheaves are a class of sheaves closely linked to the geometric properties of the underlying space. The definition of coherent sheaves is made with reference to a sheaf of rings that codifies this geometric information.","image":"46716c1fec068ffe9981107a5a215fa1fc9e7d5f.svg","url":"Coherent_sheaf"}
