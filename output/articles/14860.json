{"title":"Square principle","summary":"In mathematical set theory, a square principle is a combinatorial principle asserting the existence of a cohering sequence of short closed unbounded (club) sets so that no one (long) club set coheres with them all.  As such they may be viewed as a kind of incompactness phenomenon.[1]  They were introduced by Ronald Jensen in his analysis of  the fine structure of the constructible universe L.","image":"f6a82c920c4296e0bb9abb84759756f7490153f2.svg","url":"Square_principle"}
