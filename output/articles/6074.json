{"title":"Generalized function","summary":"In mathematics, generalized functions are objects extending the notion of functions. There is more than one recognized theory, for example  the theory of distributions. Generalized functions are especially useful in making discontinuous functions more like smooth functions, and describing discrete physical phenomena such as point charges. They are applied extensively, especially in physics and engineering.","image":"50c76de480256203f02003cbc14b9855ab141898.svg","url":"Generalized_function"}
