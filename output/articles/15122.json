{"title":"Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines","summary":"Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines are field lines in a fluid flow. They differ only when the flow changes with time, that is, when the flow is not steady.[1] [2] Considering a velocity vector field in three-dimensional space in the framework of continuum mechanics, we have that:","image":"Streaklines_and_pathlines_animation_(low).gif","url":"Streamlines,_streaklines,_and_pathlines"}
