{"title":"EdDSA","summary":"In public-key cryptography, Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) is a digital signature scheme using a variant of Schnorr signature based on twisted Edwards curves.[1] It is designed to be faster than existing digital signature schemes without sacrificing security. It was developed by a team including Daniel J. Bernstein, Niels Duif, Tanja Lange, Peter Schwabe, and Bo-Yin Yang.[2] The reference implementation is public-domain software.[3]","image":"dbb96e056c071d13fc7702013f9273e7f5cd88a7.svg","url":"EdDSA"}
