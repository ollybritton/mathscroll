{"title":"Schwartz topological vector space","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, Schwartz spaces are topological vector spaces (TVS) whose neighborhoods of the origin have a property similar to the definition of totally bounded subsets. These spaces were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck.","image":"d7a3a5819cc45f097de14b3ac5a8bedd902bc66d.svg","url":"Schwartz_topological_vector_space"}
