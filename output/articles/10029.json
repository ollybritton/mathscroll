{"title":"Matching polynomial","summary":"In the mathematical fields of graph theory and combinatorics, a matching polynomial (sometimes called an acyclic polynomial) is a generating function of the numbers of matchings of various sizes in a graph. It is one of several graph polynomials studied in algebraic graph theory.","image":"2c2732732895c29d655c797b886c78f46ab5c56a.svg","url":"Matching_polynomial"}
