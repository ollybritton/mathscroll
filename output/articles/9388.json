{"title":"Linear topology","summary":"In algebra, a linear topology on a left A {\\displaystyle A} -module M {\\displaystyle M} is a topology on M {\\displaystyle M} that is invariant under translations and admits a fundamental system of neighborhood of 0 {\\displaystyle 0} that consists of submodules of M . {\\displaystyle M.} If there is such a topology, M {\\displaystyle M} is said to be linearly topologized. If A {\\displaystyle A} is given a discrete topology, then M {\\displaystyle M} becomes a topological A {\\displaystyle A} -module with respect to a linear topology.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Linear_topology"}
