{"title":"Uniformly bounded representation","summary":"In mathematics, a uniformly bounded representation T {\\displaystyle T} of a locally compact group G {\\displaystyle G} on a Hilbert space H {\\displaystyle H} is a homomorphism into the bounded invertible operators which is continuous for the strong operator topology, and such that sup g ∈ G ‖ T g ‖ B ( H ) {\\displaystyle \\sup _{g\\in G}\\|T_{g}\\|_{B(H)}} is finite. In 1947 Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy established that any uniformly bounded representation of the integers or the real numbers is unitarizable, i.e. conjugate by an invertible operator to a unitary representation. For the integers this gives a criterion for an invertible operator to be similar to a unitary operator: the operator norms of all the positive and negative powers must be uniformly bounded. The result on unitarizability of uniformly bounded representations was extended in 1950 by Dixmier, Day and Nakamura-Takeda to all locally compact amenable groups, following essentially the method of proof of Sz-Nagy. The result is known to fail for non-amenable groups such as  SL(2,R) and the free group on two generators. Dixmier (1950) conjectured that a locally compact group is amenable if and only if every uniformly bounded representation is unitarizable.","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Uniformly_bounded_representation"}
