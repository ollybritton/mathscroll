{"title":"Wave equation","summary":"The (two-way) wave equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of waves or standing wave fields –  as they occur in classical physics –  such as mechanical waves (e.g. water waves, sound waves and seismic waves) or electromagnetic waves (including light waves). It arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetism, and fluid dynamics. Single mechanical or electromagnetic waves propagating in a pre-defined direction can also be described with the first-order one-way wave equation, which is much easier to solve and also valid for inhomogeneous media.","image":"Wave_equation_1D_fixed_endpoints.gif","url":"Wave_equation"}
