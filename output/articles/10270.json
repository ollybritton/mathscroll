{"title":"Measure space","summary":"A measure space is a basic object of measure theory, a branch of mathematics that studies generalized notions of volumes. It contains an underlying set, the subsets of this set that are feasible for measuring (the Ïƒ-algebra) and the method that is used for measuring (the measure). One important  example of a measure space is a probability space.","image":"03ae565719308bef975e38cd6622e9a645a97e41.svg","url":"Measure_space"}
