{"title":"Plateau's problem","summary":"In mathematics, Plateau's problem is to show the existence of a minimal surface with a given boundary, a problem raised by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1760.  However, it is named after Joseph Plateau who experimented with soap films.  The problem is considered part of the calculus of variations. The existence and regularity problems are part of geometric measure theory.","image":"Bulle_caténoïde.png.webp","url":"Plateau's_problem"}
