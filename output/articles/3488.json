{"title":"Counting lemma","summary":"The counting lemmas this article discusses are statements in combinatorics and graph theory. The first one extracts information from Ïµ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } -regular pairs of subsets of vertices in a graph G {\\displaystyle G} , in order to guarantee patterns in the entire graph; more explicitly, these patterns correspond to the count of copies of a certain graph H {\\displaystyle H} in G {\\displaystyle G} . The second counting lemma provides a similar yet more general notion on the space of graphons, in which a scalar of the cut distance between two graphs is correlated to the homomorphism density between them and H {\\displaystyle H} .","image":"c3837cad72483d97bcdde49c85d3b7b859fb3fd2.svg","url":"Counting_lemma"}
