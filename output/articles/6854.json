{"title":"Hand eye calibration problem","summary":"In robotics and mathematics, the hand eye calibration problem (also called the robot-sensor or robot-world calibration problem) is the problem of determining the transformation between a robot end-effector and a sensor or sensors (camera or laser scanner) or between a robot base and the world coordinate system.[1] It takes the form of AX=ZB, where A and B are two systems, usually a robot base and a camera, and X and Z are unknown transformation matrices. A highly studied special case of the problem occurs where X=Z, taking the form of the problem AX=XB. Solutions to the problem take the forms of several types of methods, including separable closed-form solutions, simultaneous closed-form solutions, and iterative solutions.[2] The covariance of X in the equation can be calculated for any randomly perturbed matrices A and B.[3]","image":"87a94aa14931de5dc5dc28ae22de6cc1697ac5da.svg","url":"Hand_eye_calibration_problem"}
