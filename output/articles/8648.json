{"title":"Kemnitz's conjecture","summary":"In additive number theory, Kemnitz's conjecture states that every set of lattice points in the plane has a large subset whose centroid is also a lattice point. It was proved independently in the autumn of 2003 by Christian Reiher, then an undergraduate student, and Carlos di Fiore, then a high school student.[1]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Kemnitz's_conjecture"}
