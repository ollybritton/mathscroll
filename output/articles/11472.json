{"title":"Order-3 apeirogonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the order-3 apeirogonal tiling is a regular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It is represented by the Schläfli symbol {∞,3}, having three regular apeirogons around each vertex.  Each apeirogon is inscribed in a horocycle.","image":"H2-I-3-dual.svg.png.webp","url":"Order-3_apeirogonal_tiling"}
