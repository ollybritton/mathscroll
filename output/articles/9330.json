{"title":"Lindström quantifier","summary":"In mathematical logic, a Lindström quantifier is a generalized polyadic quantifier. Lindström quantifiers generalize first-order quantifiers, such as the existential quantifier, the universal quantifier, and the counting quantifiers. They were introduced by Per Lindström in 1966. They were later studied for their applications in logic in computer science and database query languages.","image":"af0af3e10102ddaa9fc10a6be34c2ed108b4cab5.svg","url":"Lindström_quantifier"}
