{"title":"Linear space (geometry)","summary":"A linear space is a basic structure in incidence geometry.  A linear space consists of a set of elements called points, and a set of elements called lines.  Each line is a distinct subset of the points.  The points in a line are said to be incident with the line.  Any two lines may have no more than one point in common.  Intuitively, this rule can be visualized as the property that two straight lines never intersect more than once.","image":"166a6bddd21cf1ecdff2febd74b5d64fbbcc5b9e.svg","url":"Linear_space_(geometry)"}
