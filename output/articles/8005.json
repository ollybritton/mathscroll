{"title":"Inverse semigroup","summary":"In group theory, an inverse semigroup (occasionally called an inversion semigroup[1]) S is a semigroup in which every element x in S has a unique inverse y in S in the sense that x = xyx and y = yxy, i.e. a regular semigroup in which every element has a unique inverse. Inverse semigroups appear in a range of contexts; for example, they can be employed in the study of partial symmetries.[2]","image":"a2f6e744a6a9f94ada3a64a70d499407864bdc4f.svg","url":"Inverse_semigroup"}
