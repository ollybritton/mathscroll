{"title":"Christoffel symbols","summary":"In mathematics and physics, the Christoffel symbols are an array of numbers describing a metric connection.[1]  The metric connection is a specialization of the affine connection to surfaces or other manifolds endowed with a metric, allowing distances to be measured on that surface.  In differential geometry, an affine connection can be defined without reference to a metric, and many additional concepts follow: parallel transport, covariant derivatives, geodesics, etc. also do not require the concept of a metric.[2][3] However, when a metric is available, these concepts can be directly tied to the \"shape\" of the manifold itself; that shape is determined by how the tangent space is attached to the cotangent space by the metric tensor.[4] Abstractly, one would say that the manifold has an associated (orthonormal) frame bundle, with each \"frame\" being a possible choice of a coordinate frame. An invariant metric implies that the structure group of the frame bundle is the orthogonal group O(p, q). As a result, such a manifold is necessarily a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold.[5][6] The Christoffel symbols provide a concrete representation of the connection of (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry in terms of coordinates on the manifold. Additional concepts, such as parallel transport, geodesics, etc. can then be expressed in terms of Christoffel symbols.","image":"6f6ca276d5e4ee2376e449dd66a2779be554a79a.svg","url":"A%2fChristoffel_symbols"}
