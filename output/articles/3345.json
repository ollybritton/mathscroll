{"title":"Contractible space","summary":"In mathematics, a topological space X is contractible if the identity map on X is null-homotopic, i.e. if it is homotopic to some constant map.[1][2] Intuitively, a contractible space is one that can be continuously shrunk to a point within that space.","image":"Contractibility_figure.png.webp","url":"Contractible_space"}
