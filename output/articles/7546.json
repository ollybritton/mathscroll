{"title":"Hypocycloid","summary":"In geometry, a hypocycloid is a special plane curve generated by the trace of a fixed point on a small circle that rolls within a larger circle. As the radius of the larger circle is increased, the hypocycloid becomes more like the cycloid created by rolling a circle on a line.","image":"Astroid2.gif","url":"Hypocycloid"}
