{"title":"Calabi conjecture","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, the Calabi conjecture was a conjecture about the existence of certain kinds of Riemannian metrics on certain complex manifolds, made by Eugenio Calabi (1954, 1957). It was proved by Shing-Tung Yau (1977, 1978), who received the Fields Medal and Oswald Veblen Prize in part for his proof. His work, principally an analysis of an elliptic partial differential equation known as the complex Monge–Ampère equation, was an influential early result in the field of geometric analysis.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Calabi_conjecture"}
