{"title":"Omnitruncated simplectic honeycomb","summary":"In geometry an omnitruncated simplectic honeycomb or omnitruncated n-simplex honeycomb is an n-dimensional uniform tessellation, based on the symmetry of the A ~ n {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {A}}_{n}} affine Coxeter group. Each is composed of omnitruncated simplex facets. The vertex figure for each is an irregular n-simplex.","image":"0dd3539f67ef780c40d9fa80a95b764637fa74af.svg","url":"Omnitruncated_simplectic_honeycomb"}
