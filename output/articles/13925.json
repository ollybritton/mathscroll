{"title":"Scaled inverse chi-squared distribution","summary":"The scaled inverse chi-squared distribution is the distribution for x = 1/s2, where s2 is a sample mean of the squares of ν independent normal random variables that have mean 0 and inverse variance 1/σ2 = τ2.  The distribution is therefore parametrised by the two quantities ν and τ2, referred to as the number of chi-squared degrees of freedom and the scaling parameter, respectively.","image":"Scaled_inverse_chi_squared.svg.png.webp","url":"Scaled_inverse_chi-squared_distribution"}
