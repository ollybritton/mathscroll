{"title":"Class function","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the fields of group theory and representation theory of groups, a class function is a function on a group G that is constant on the conjugacy classes of G. In other words, it is invariant under the conjugation map onÂ G.  Such functions play a basic role in representation theory.","image":"4029c250e0edb5e54d71bcb402344198fb88d786.svg","url":"Class_function"}
