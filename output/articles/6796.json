{"title":"Hahn polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the Hahn polynomials are a family of orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials,  introduced by Pafnuty Chebyshev in 1875 (Chebyshev 1907) and rediscovered by Wolfgang Hahn (Hahn 1949). The Hahn class is a name for special cases of Hahn polynomials, including Hahn polynomials, Meixner polynomials, Krawtchouk polynomials, and Charlier polynomials. Sometimes the Hahn class is taken to include limiting cases of these polynomials, in which case it also includes the classical orthogonal polynomials.","image":"75fec371955bc113a64d6d633c06a5dd6efea228.svg","url":"Hahn_polynomials"}
