{"title":"Graceful labeling","summary":"In graph theory, a graceful labeling of a graph with m edges is a labeling of its vertices with some subset of the integers from 0 to m inclusive, such that no two vertices share a label, and each edge is uniquely identified by the absolute difference between its endpoints, such that this magnitude lies between 1 and m inclusive.[1]  A graph which admits a graceful labeling is called a graceful graph.","image":"Graceful_labeling.svg.png.webp","url":"Graceful_labeling"}
