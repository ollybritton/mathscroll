{"title":"Jacobi elliptic functions","summary":"In mathematics, the Jacobi elliptic functions are a set of basic elliptic functions.  They are found in the description of the motion of a pendulum (see also pendulum (mathematics)), as well as in the design of electronic elliptic filters. While trigonometric functions are defined with reference to a circle, the Jacobi elliptic functions are a generalization which refer to other conic sections, the ellipse in particular. The relation to trigonometric functions is contained in the notation, for example, by the matching notation sn {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {sn} } for sin {\\displaystyle \\sin } . The Jacobi elliptic functions are used more often in practical problems than the Weierstrass elliptic functions as they do not require notions of complex analysis to be defined and/or understood. They were introduced by Carl Gustav Jakob JacobiÂ (1829). Carl Friedrich Gauss had already studied special Jacobi elliptic functions in 1797, the lemniscate elliptic functions in particular,[1] but his work was published much later.","image":"07fc4a1c1c7d5576f9e6b5d6e8aa30337c9531ab.svg","url":"Jacobi_elliptic_functions"}
