{"title":"Standard translation","summary":"In modal logic, standard translation is a logic translation that transforms formulas of modal logic into formulas of first-order logic which capture the meaning of the modal formulas. Standard translation is defined inductively on the structure of the formula. In short, atomic formulas are mapped onto unary predicates and the objects in the first-order language are the accessible worlds. The logical connectives from propositional logic remain untouched and the modal operators are transformed into first-order formulas according to their semantics.","image":"cf760193c46c00ec6b14f8c04926d5a0cdb6ade0.svg","url":"Standard_translation"}
