{"title":"Tomita–Takesaki theory","summary":"In the theory of von Neumann algebras, a part of the mathematical field of functional analysis, Tomita–Takesaki theory  is a method for constructing modular automorphisms of von Neumann algebras from the polar decomposition of a certain involution. It is essential for the theory of type III factors, and has led to a good structure theory for these previously intractable objects.","image":"72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4.svg","url":"Tomita–Takesaki_theory"}
