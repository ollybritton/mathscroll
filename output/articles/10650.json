{"title":"Monogenic function","summary":"A monogenic [1][2] function is a complex function with a single finite derivative. More precisely, a function f ( z ) {\\displaystyle f(z)} defined on A ⊆ C {\\displaystyle A\\subseteq \\mathbb {C} } is called monogenic at ζ ∈ A {\\displaystyle \\zeta \\in A} , if f ′ ( ζ ) {\\displaystyle f'(\\zeta )} exists and is finite, with:","image":"d8dd568d570b390c337c0a911f0a1c5c214e8240.svg","url":"Monogenic_function"}
