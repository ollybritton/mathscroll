{"title":"Steffensen's method","summary":"In numerical analysis, Steffensen's method is a root-finding technique named after Johan Frederik Steffensen which is similar to Newton's method. Steffensen's method also achieves quadratic convergence, but without using derivatives as Newton's method does.","image":"7f42f7ace7f47bf93ad0970b21b5c8f89d6895f2.svg","url":"Steffensen's_method"}
