{"title":"Wonderful compactification","summary":"In algebraic group theory, a wonderful compactification of a variety acted on by an algebraic group G {\\displaystyle G} is a G {\\displaystyle G} -equivariant compactification such that the closure of each orbit is smooth.   Corrado de Concini and Claudio Procesi (1983) constructed a wonderful compactification of any symmetric variety given by a quotient G / G σ {\\displaystyle G/G^{\\sigma }} of an algebraic group G {\\displaystyle G} by the subgroup G σ {\\displaystyle G^{\\sigma }} fixed by some involution σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } of G {\\displaystyle G} over the complex numbers, sometimes called the De Concini–Procesi compactification, and Elisabetta Strickland (1987) generalized this construction to arbitrary characteristic. In particular, by writing a group G {\\displaystyle G} itself as a symmetric homogeneous space, G = ( G × G ) / G {\\displaystyle G=(G\\times G)/G} (modulo the diagonal subgroup), this gives a wonderful compactification of the group G {\\displaystyle G} itself.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Wonderful_compactification"}
