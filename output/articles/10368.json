{"title":"Method of virtual quanta","summary":"The method of virtual quanta is a method used to calculate radiation produced by interactions of electromagnetic particles, particularly in the case of bremsstrahlung. It can also be applied in the context of gravitational radiation, and more recently to other field theories. The method was first developed by C. F. Weizsaecker and E. J. Williams in 1934.","image":"97477fe47cc5a6991801babfe955a49df33c13f2.svg","url":"Method_of_virtual_quanta"}
