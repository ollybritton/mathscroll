{"title":"Theta constant","summary":"In mathematics, a theta constant or Thetanullwert' (German for theta zero value; plural Thetanullwerte) is the restriction θm(τ) = θm(τ,0) of a theta function θm(τ,z) with rational characteristic m to z = 0. The variable τ may be a complex number in the upper half-plane in which case the theta constants are modular forms, or more generally may be an element of a Siegel upper half plane in which case the theta constants are Siegel modular forms. The theta function of a lattice is essentially a special case of a theta constant.","image":"b01fd70d3489ca592e9ecf2ffcca06415fc9c822.svg","url":"Theta_constant"}
