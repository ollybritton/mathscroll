{"title":"Harmonic coordinates","summary":"In Riemannian geometry, a branch of mathematics, harmonic coordinates are a certain kind of coordinate chart on a smooth manifold, determined by a Riemannian metric on the manifold. They are useful in many problems of geometric analysis due to their regularity properties.","image":"4fa642923a9806a109923788b015d405cd8dc7bf.svg","url":"Harmonic_coordinates"}
