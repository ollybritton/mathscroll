{"title":"Gegenbauer polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, Gegenbauer polynomials or ultraspherical polynomials C(α)n(x) are  orthogonal polynomials on the interval [−1,1] with respect to the weight function (1 − x2)α–1/2. They generalize Legendre polynomials and Chebyshev polynomials, and are special cases of Jacobi polynomials. They are named after Leopold Gegenbauer.","image":"Plot_of_the_Gegenbauer_polynomial_C_n^(m)(x)_with_n%3D10_and_m%3D1_in_the_complex_plane_from_-2-2i_to_2%2B2i_with_colors_created_with_Mathematica_13.1_function_ComplexPlot3D.svg.png.webp","url":"Gegenbauer_polynomials"}
