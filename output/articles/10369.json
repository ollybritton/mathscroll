{"title":"Methods of computing square roots","summary":"Methods of computing square roots are numerical analysis algorithms for approximating the principal, or non-negative, square root (usually denoted S {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {S}}} , S 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt[{2}]{S}}} , or S 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle S^{1/2}} ) of a real number. Arithmetically, it means given S {\\displaystyle S} , a procedure for finding a number which when multiplied by itself, yields S {\\displaystyle S} ; algebraically, it means a procedure for finding the non-negative root of the equation x 2 âˆ’ S = 0 {\\displaystyle x^{2}-S=0} ; geometrically, it means given two line segments, a procedure for constructing their geometric mean.","image":"bff86975b0e7944720b3e635c53c22c032a7a6f1.svg","url":"Methods_of_computing_square_roots"}
