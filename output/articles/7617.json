{"title":"Ideal polyhedron","summary":"In three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, an ideal polyhedron is a convex polyhedron all of whose vertices are ideal points, points \"at infinity\" rather than interior to three-dimensional hyperbolic space. It can be defined as the convex hull of a finite set of ideal points. An ideal polyhedron has ideal polygons as its faces, meeting along lines of the hyperbolic space.","image":"Hyperbolic_Octahedron.jpg.webp","url":"Ideal_polyhedron"}
