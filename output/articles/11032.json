{"title":"New Math","summary":"New Mathematics or New Math was a dramatic but temporary change in the way mathematics was taught in American grade schools, and to a lesser extent in European countries and elsewhere, during the 1950sâ€“1970s. Curriculum topics and teaching practices were changed in the U.S. shortly after the Sputnik crisis.  The goal was to boost students' science education and mathematical skills to compete with Soviet engineers, reputedly highly skilled mathematicians.","image":"Spines_of_New_Math_paperbacks_from_1960s.jpg.webp","url":"New_Math"}
