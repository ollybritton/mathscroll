{"title":"Doubling time","summary":"The doubling time is the time it takes for a population to double in size/value. It is applied to population growth, inflation, resource extraction, consumption of goods, compound interest, the volume of malignant tumours, and many other things that tend to grow over time.  When the relative growth rate (not the absolute growth rate) is constant, the quantity undergoes exponential growth and has a constant doubling time or period, which can be calculated directly from the growth rate.","image":"44fa9e83cc6807214d065fe22aa46c041e45482e.svg","url":"Doubling_time"}
