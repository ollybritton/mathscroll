{"title":"Pointed space","summary":"In mathematics, a pointed space or based space is a topological space with a distinguished point, the basepoint. The distinguished point is just simply one particular point, picked out from the space, and given a name, such as x 0 , {\\displaystyle x_{0},} that remains unchanged during subsequent discussion, and is kept track of during all operations.","image":"c8b35dd572e629881da4083ad1681bc7cf420304.svg","url":"Pointed_space"}
