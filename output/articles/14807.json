{"title":"Spin chain","summary":"A spin chain is a type of model in statistical physics. Spin chains were originally formulated to model magnetic systems, which typically consist of particles with magnetic spin located at fixed sites on a lattice. A prototypical example is the quantum Heisenberg model. Interactions between the sites are modelled by operators which act on two different sites.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Spin_chain"}
