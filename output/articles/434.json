{"title":"Affine involution","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, of special interest are involutions which are linear or affine transformations over the Euclidean space Rn. Such involutions are easy to characterize and they can be described geometrically.[1]","image":"4e0340b071740d1a3bcad962c7bc6c835f974c4e.svg","url":"Affine_involution"}
