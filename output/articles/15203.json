{"title":"Subordinator (mathematics)","summary":"In probability theory, a Subordinator is a stochastic process that is non-negative and whose increments are stationary and independent.[1] Subordinators are a special class of LÃ©vy process that play an important role in the theory of local time.[2] In this context, subordinators describe the evolution of time within another stochastic process, the subordinated stochastic process. In other words, a subordinator will determine the random number of \"time steps\" that occur within the subordinated process for a given unit of chronological time.","image":"478bcaa73ef8daeb8bd07701b59c6384b689f131.svg","url":"Subordinator_(mathematics)"}
