{"title":"Banach algebra cohomology","summary":"In mathematics, Banach algebra cohomology of a Banach algebra with coefficients in a bimodule is a cohomology theory defined in a similar way to Hochschild cohomology of an abstract algebra, except that one takes the topology into account so that all cochains and so on are continuous.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Banach_algebra_cohomology"}
