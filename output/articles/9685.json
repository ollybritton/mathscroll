{"title":"Log–log plot","summary":"In science and engineering, a log–log graph or log–log plot is a two-dimensional graph of numerical data that uses logarithmic scales on both the horizontal and vertical axes. Power functions – relationships of the form y = a x k {\\displaystyle y=ax^{k}} – appear as straight lines in a log–log graph, with the exponent corresponding to the slope, and the coefficient corresponding to the intercept. Thus these graphs are very useful for recognizing these relationships and estimating parameters. Any base can be used for the logarithm, though most commonly base 10 (common logs) are used.","image":"317e79039d7e940a8f6a960f74aa24b0025678c6.svg","url":"Log–log_plot"}
