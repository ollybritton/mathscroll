{"title":"Artin–Schreier theory","summary":"In mathematics, Artin–Schreier theory is a branch of Galois theory, specifically a positive characteristic analogue of Kummer theory, for Galois extensions of degree equal to the characteristic p.  Artin and  Schreier (1927) introduced Artin–Schreier theory for extensions of prime degree p, and Witt (1936) generalized it to extensions of prime power degree pn.","image":"d3ecd2b433da0c26e28e3fede5bdb7bb20592e7b.svg","url":"Artin–Schreier_theory"}
