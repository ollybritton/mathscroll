{"title":"Sedenion","summary":"In abstract algebra, the sedenions form a 16-dimensional noncommutative and nonassociative algebra over the real numbers, usually represented by the capital letter S, boldface S or blackboard bold S {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {S} } . They are obtained by applying the Cayley–Dickson construction to the octonions, and as such the octonions are isomorphic to a subalgebra of the sedenions. Unlike the octonions, the sedenions are not an alternative algebra. Applying the Cayley–Dickson construction to the sedenions yields a 32-dimensional algebra, sometimes called the 32-ions or trigintaduonions.[1] It is possible to continue applying the Cayley–Dickson construction arbitrarily many times.","image":"9f9d5874c5d7f68eba1cec9da9ccbe53903303bb.svg","url":"Sedenion"}
