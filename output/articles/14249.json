{"title":"Shannon switching game","summary":"The Shannon switching game is a connection game for two players, invented by American mathematician and electrical engineer Claude Shannon, the \"father of information theory\" some time before 1951.[1]  Two players take turns coloring the edges of an arbitrary graph. One player has the goal of connecting two distinguished vertices by a path of edges of their color. The other player aims to prevent this by using their color instead (or, equivalently, by erasing edges).  The game is commonly played on a rectangular grid; this special case of the game was independently invented by American mathematician David Gale in the late 1950s and is known as Gale or Bridg-It.[2][3]","image":"Shannon_game_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Shannon_switching_game"}
