{"title":"Higman's lemma","summary":"In mathematics, Higman's lemma states that the set of finite sequences over a finite alphabet, as partially ordered by the subsequence relation, is well-quasi-ordered. That is, if w 1 , w 2 , â€¦ {\\displaystyle w_{1},w_{2},\\ldots } is an infinite sequence of words over some fixed finite alphabet, then there exist indices i < j {\\displaystyle i<j} such that w i {\\displaystyle w_{i}} can be obtained from w j {\\displaystyle w_{j}} by deleting some (possibly none) symbols. More generally this remains true when the alphabet is not necessarily finite, but is itself well-quasi-ordered, and the subsequence relation allows the replacement of symbols by earlier symbols in the well-quasi-ordering of labels. This is a special case of the later Kruskal's tree theorem. It is named after Graham Higman, who published it in 1952.","image":"b0c6c474fad63cfb1e1d5e4198cd0160895f76b8.svg","url":"Higman's_lemma"}
