{"title":"Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal","summary":"Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal is an idea attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings by constructing an immense right triangle and three squares on the surface of the Earth. The shapes would be a symbolic representation of the Pythagorean theorem, large enough to be seen from the Moon or Mars.","image":"Pythagorean.svg.png.webp","url":"Gauss's_Pythagorean_right_triangle_proposal"}
