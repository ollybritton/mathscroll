{"title":"Sagitta (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, the sagitta (sometimes abbreviated as sag[1]) of a circular arc is the distance from the center of the arc to the center of its base.[2] It is used extensively in architecture when calculating the arc necessary to span a certain height and distance and also in optics where it is used to find the depth of a spherical mirror or lens. The name comes directly from Latin sagitta, meaning an arrow.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Sagitta_(geometry)"}
