{"title":"Transpositions matrix","summary":"Transpositions matrix (Tr matrix) is square n × n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} matrix, n = 2 m {\\displaystyle n=2^{m}} , m ∈ N {\\displaystyle m\\in N} , which elements are obtained from the elements of given n-dimensional vector X = ( x i ) i = 1 , n {\\displaystyle X=(x_{i})_{\\begin{smallmatrix}i={1,n}\\end{smallmatrix}}} as follows: T r i , j = x ( i − 1 ) ⊕ ( j − 1 ) + 1 {\\displaystyle Tr_{i,j}=x_{(i-1)\\oplus (j-1)+1}} , where ⊕ {\\displaystyle \\oplus } denotes operation \"bitwise Exclusive or\" (XOR). The rows and columns of Transpositions matrix consists permutation of elements of vector X, as there are n/2 transpositions between every two rows or columns of the matrix","image":"59d2b4cb72e304526cf5b5887147729ea259da78.svg","url":"Transpositions_matrix"}
