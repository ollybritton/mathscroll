{"title":"Subderivative","summary":"In mathematics, the subderivative, subgradient, and subdifferential generalize the derivative to convex functions which are not necessarily differentiable. Subderivatives arise in convex analysis, the study of convex functions, often in connection to convex optimization.","image":"Subderivative_illustration.png.webp","url":"Subderivative"}
