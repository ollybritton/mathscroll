{"title":"Pentation","summary":"In mathematics, pentation (or hyper-5) is the next hyperoperation after tetration and before hexation. It is defined as iterated (repeated) tetration, just as tetration is iterated exponentiation.[1] It is a binary operation defined with two numbers a and b, where a is tetrated to itself b-1 times. For instance, using hyperoperation notation for pentation and tetration, 2 [ 5 ] 3 {\\displaystyle 2[5]3} means tetrating 2 to itself 2 times, or 2 [ 4 ] ( 2 [ 4 ] 2 ) {\\displaystyle 2[4](2[4]2)} . This can then be reduced to 2 [ 4 ] ( 2 2 ) = 2 [ 4 ] 4 = 2 2 2 2 = 2 2 4 = 2 16 = 65536. {\\displaystyle 2[4](2^{2})=2[4]4=2^{2^{2^{2}}}=2^{2^{4}}=2^{16}=65536.}","image":"30c3c4f3a4215af3d0aba5d1be34d345eb03d108.svg","url":"Pentation"}
