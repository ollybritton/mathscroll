{"title":"Ordinal arithmetic","summary":"In the mathematical field of set theory, ordinal arithmetic describes the three usual operations on ordinal numbers: addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. Each can be defined in essentially two different ways: either by constructing an explicit well-ordered set that represents the result of the operation or by using transfinite recursion. Cantor normal form provides a standardized way of writing ordinals. In addition to these usual ordinal operations, there are also the \"natural\" arithmetic of ordinals and the nimber operations.","image":"e8ff7d0293ad19b43524a133ae5129f3d71f2040.svg","url":"Ordinal_arithmetic"}
