{"title":"Partial function","summary":"In mathematics, a partial function f from a set X to a set Y is a function from a subset S of X (possibly the whole X itself) to Y. The subset S, that is, the domain of f viewed as a function, is called the domain of definition or natural domain of f. If S equals X, that is, if f is defined on every element in X, then f is said to be a total function.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Partial_function"}
