{"title":"Aristotelian realist philosophy of mathematics","summary":"In the philosophy of mathematics, Aristotelian realism holds that mathematics studies properties such as symmetry, continuity and order that can be immanently realized in the physical world (or in any other world there might be). It contrasts with Platonism in holding that the objects of mathematics, such as numbers, do not exist in an \"abstract\" world but can be physically realized.[1] It contrasts with nominalism, fictionalism, and logicism in holding that mathematics is not about mere names or methods of inference or calculation but about certain real aspects of the world.","image":"KÃ¶nigsberg_riddle.png.webp","url":"Aristotelian_realist_philosophy_of_mathematics"}
