{"title":"Gauss–Markov process","summary":"Gauss–Markov stochastic processes (named after Carl Friedrich Gauss and Andrey Markov) are stochastic processes that satisfy the requirements for both Gaussian processes and Markov processes.[1][2] A stationary Gauss–Markov process is unique up to rescaling; such a process is also known as an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process.","image":"54ef122346e5b88b99f893428b1c4944db1e2563.svg","url":"Gauss–Markov_process"}
