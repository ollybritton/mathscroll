{"title":"Hammersley–Clifford theorem","summary":"The Hammersley–Clifford theorem is a result in probability theory, mathematical statistics and statistical mechanics that gives necessary and sufficient conditions under which a strictly positive probability distribution (of events in a probability space)  can be represented as events generated by a Markov network (also known as a Markov random field). It is the fundamental theorem of random fields.[1] It states that a probability distribution that has a strictly positive mass or density satisfies one of the Markov properties with respect to an undirected graph G if and only if it is a Gibbs random field, that is, its density can be factorized over the cliques (or complete subgraphs) of the graph.","image":"A_simple_Markov_network.png.webp","url":"Hammersley–Clifford_theorem"}
