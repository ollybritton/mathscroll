{"title":"Bivariegated graph","summary":"In graph theory, a bivariegated graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into two equal parts such that each vertex is adjacent to exactly one vertex from the other set not containing it.[1][2][3] In a bivarigated graph G with 2n vertices, there exists a set of n independent edges such that no odd number of them lie on a cycle of G.","image":"Petersen1_tiny.svg.png.webp","url":"Bivariegated_graph"}
