{"title":"Residue field","summary":"In mathematics, the residue field is a basic construction in commutative algebra. If R is a commutative ring and m is a maximal ideal, then the residue field is the quotient ring k = R/m, which is a field.[1] Frequently, R is a local ring and m is then its unique maximal ideal.","image":"a77528d0510c9b72bdec0ee8597a1df6959000f4.svg","url":"Residue_field"}
