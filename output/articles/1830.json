{"title":"Boolean-valued function","summary":"A Boolean-valued function (sometimes called a predicate or a proposition) is a function of the type f : X → B, where X is an arbitrary set and where B is a Boolean domain, i.e. a generic two-element set, (for example B = {0, 1}), whose elements are interpreted as logical values, for example, 0 = false and 1 = true, i.e., a single bit of information.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Boolean-valued_function"}
