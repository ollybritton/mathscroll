{"title":"Equivariant topology","summary":"In mathematics, equivariant topology is the study of topological spaces that possess certain symmetries. In studying topological spaces, one often considers continuous maps f : X â†’ Y {\\displaystyle f:X\\to Y} , and while equivariant topology also considers such maps, there is the additional constraint that each map \"respects symmetry\" in both its domain and target space.","image":"abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c.svg","url":"Equivariant_topology"}
