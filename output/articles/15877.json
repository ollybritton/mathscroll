{"title":"Torelli theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Torelli theorem, named after Ruggiero Torelli, is a classical result of algebraic geometry over the complex number field, stating that a non-singular projective algebraic curve (compact Riemann surface) C is determined by its Jacobian variety J(C), when the latter is given in the form of a principally polarized abelian variety. In other words, the complex torus J(C), with certain 'markings', is enough to recover C. The same statement holds over any algebraically closed field.[1] From more precise information on the constructed isomorphism of the curves it follows that if the canonically principally polarized Jacobian varieties of curves of genus â‰¥ 2 {\\displaystyle \\geq 2} are k-isomorphic for k any perfect field, so are the curves.[2]","image":"25a54ba6d06eab355fe1fb7e66f3a073de6db584.svg","url":"Torelli_theorem"}
