{"title":"Separating set","summary":"In mathematics, a set S {\\displaystyle S} of functions with domain D {\\displaystyle D} is called a separating set for D {\\displaystyle D} and is said to separate the points of D {\\displaystyle D} (or just to separate points) if for any two distinct elements x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} of D , {\\displaystyle D,} there exists a function f ∈ S {\\displaystyle f\\in S} such that f ( x ) ≠ f ( y ) . {\\displaystyle f(x)\\neq f(y).} [1]","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Separating_set"}
