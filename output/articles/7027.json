{"title":"Hemi-dodecahedron","summary":"A hemi-dodecahedron is an abstract regular polyhedron, containing half the faces of a regular dodecahedron. It can be realized as a projective polyhedron (a tessellation of the real projective plane by 6 pentagons), which can be visualized by constructing the projective plane as a hemisphere where opposite points along the boundary are connected and dividing the hemisphere into three equal parts.","image":"Hemi-Dodecahedron2.PNG.webp","url":"Hemi-dodecahedron"}
