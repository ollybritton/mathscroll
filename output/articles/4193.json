{"title":"Directed set","summary":"In mathematics, a directed set (or a directed preorder or a filtered set) is a nonempty set A {\\displaystyle A} together with a reflexive and transitive binary relation ≤ {\\displaystyle \\,\\leq \\,} (that is, a preorder), with the additional property that every pair of elements has an upper bound.[1] In other words, for any a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} in A {\\displaystyle A} there must exist c {\\displaystyle c} in A {\\displaystyle A} with a ≤ c {\\displaystyle a\\leq c} and b ≤ c . {\\displaystyle b\\leq c.} A directed set's preorder is called a direction.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Directed_set"}
