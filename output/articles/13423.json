{"title":"Resolution (algebra)","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in homological algebra, a resolution (or left resolution; dually a coresolution or right resolution[1]) is an exact sequence of modules (or, more generally, of objects of an abelian category), which is used to define invariants characterizing the structure of a specific module or object of this category. When, as usually, arrows are oriented to the right, the sequence is supposed to be infinite to the left for (left) resolutions, and to the right for right resolutions. However, a finite resolution is one where only finitely many of the objects in the sequence are non-zero; it is usually represented by a finite exact sequence in which the leftmost object (for resolutions) or the rightmost object (for coresolutions) is the zero-object.[2]","image":"68b2721f195b56285aeefca54719c2711c2c3712.svg","url":"Resolution_(algebra)"}
