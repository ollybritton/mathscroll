{"title":"Grand antiprism","summary":"In geometry, the grand antiprism or pentagonal double antiprismoid is a uniform 4-polytope (4-dimensional uniform polytope) bounded by 320 cells: 20 pentagonal antiprisms, and 300 tetrahedra. It is an anomalous, non-Wythoffian uniform 4-polytope, discovered in 1965 by Conway and Guy.[1][2] Topologically, under its highest symmetry, the pentagonal antiprisms have D5d symmetry and there are two types of tetrahedra, one with S4 symmetry and one with Cs symmetry.","image":"Grand_antiprism.png.webp","url":"Grand_antiprism"}
