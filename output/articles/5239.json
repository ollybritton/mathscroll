{"title":"F. Riesz's theorem","summary":"F. Riesz's theorem (named after Frigyes Riesz) is an important theorem in functional analysis that states that a Hausdorff topological vector space (TVS) is finite-dimensional if and only if it is locally compact. The theorem and its consequences are used ubiquitously in functional analysis, often used without being explicitly mentioned.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"F._Riesz's_theorem"}
