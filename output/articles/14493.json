{"title":"Skew partition","summary":"In graph theory, a skew partition of a graph is a partition of its vertices into two subsets, such that the induced subgraph formed by one of the two subsets is disconnected and the induced subgraph formed by the other subset is the complement of a disconnected graph. Skew partitions play an important role in the theory of perfect graphs.","image":"Skew_partition.svg.png.webp","url":"Skew_partition"}
