{"title":"Word (group theory)","summary":"In group theory, a word is any written product of group elements and their inverses.  For example, if x, y and z are elements of a group G, then xy, z−1xzz and y−1zxx−1yz−1 are words in the set {x, y, z}.  Two different words may evaluate to the same value in G,[1] or even in every group.[2]  Words play an important role in the theory of free groups and presentations, and are central objects of study in combinatorial group theory.","image":"a60cb04f184dcb07f2e210c7d2a9dfb7e937d1ff.svg","url":"Word_(group_theory)"}
