{"title":"Solid harmonics","summary":"In physics and mathematics, the solid harmonics are solutions of the Laplace equation in spherical polar coordinates, assumed to be (smooth) functions R 3 → C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}\\to \\mathbb {C} } . There are two kinds: the regular solid harmonics R ℓ m ( r ) {\\displaystyle R_{\\ell }^{m}(\\mathbf {r} )} , which are well-defined at the origin and the irregular solid harmonics I ℓ m ( r ) {\\displaystyle I_{\\ell }^{m}(\\mathbf {r} )} , which are singular at the origin. Both sets of functions play an important role in potential theory, and are obtained by rescaling spherical harmonics appropriately:","image":"e597b7979d7ead1d106129a8396697e6b9125dcb.svg","url":"Solid_harmonics"}
