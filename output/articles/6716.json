{"title":"Gödel's β function","summary":"In mathematical logic, Gödel's β function is a function used to permit quantification over finite sequences of natural numbers in formal theories of arithmetic. The β function is used, in particular, in showing that the class of arithmetically definable functions is closed under primitive recursion, and therefore includes all primitive recursive functions.","image":"7ed48a5e36207156fb792fa79d29925d2f7901e8.svg","url":"Gödel's_β_function"}
