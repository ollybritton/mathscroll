{"title":"Adams filtration","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the area of algebraic topology known as stable homotopy theory, the Adams filtration and the Adams–Novikov filtration allow a stable homotopy group to be understood as built from layers, the nth layer containing just those maps which require at most n auxiliary spaces in order to be a composition of homologically trivial maps.  These filtrations, named after Frank Adams and Sergei Novikov, are of particular interest because the Adams (–Novikov) spectral sequence converges to them.","image":"94470b44d283fde62130212956058ca6b727da37.svg","url":"Adams_filtration"}
