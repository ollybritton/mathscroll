{"title":"Kuranishi structure","summary":"In mathematics, especially in topology, a Kuranishi structure is a smooth analogue of scheme structure. If a topological space is endowed with a Kuranishi structure, then locally it can be identified with the zero set of a smooth map ( f 1 , … , f k ) : R n + k → R k {\\displaystyle (f_{1},\\ldots ,f_{k})\\colon \\mathbb {R} ^{n+k}\\to \\mathbb {R} ^{k}} , or the quotient of such a zero set by a finite group. Kuranishi structures were introduced by Japanese mathematicians Kenji Fukaya and Kaoru Ono in the study of Gromov–Witten invariants and Floer homology in symplectic geometry, and were named after Masatake Kuranishi.[1]","image":"09da45d21038df6ffb03a92b1c006618ed369710.svg","url":"Kuranishi_structure"}
