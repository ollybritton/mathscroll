{"title":"Quasireversibility","summary":"In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, quasireversibility (sometimes QR) is a property of some queues. The concept was first identified by Richard R. Muntz[1] and further developed by Frank Kelly.[2][3] Quasireversibility differs from reversibility in that a stronger condition is imposed on arrival rates and a weaker condition is applied on probability fluxes. For example, an M/M/1 queue with state-dependent arrival rates and state-dependent service times is reversible, but not quasireversible.[4]","image":"9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a.svg","url":"Quasireversibility"}
