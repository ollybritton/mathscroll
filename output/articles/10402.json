{"title":"Michael Harris (mathematician)","summary":"Michael Howard Harris (born 1954) is an American mathematician and professor of mathematics at Columbia University who specializes in number theory and representation theory. He made notable contributions to the Langlands program, for which he (alongside Richard Taylor) won the 2007 Clay Research Award.[1] In particular, he (jointly with Taylor) proved the local Langlands conjecture for GL(n) over a p-adic local field (Harris & Taylor 2001), and he was part of the team that proved the Satoâ€“Tate conjecture. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2022.[2]","image":"Wikiquote-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Michael_Harris_(mathematician)"}
