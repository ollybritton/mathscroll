{"title":"Smoothed octagon","summary":"The smoothed octagon is a region in the plane found by Karl Reinhardt in 1934 and conjectured by him to have the lowest maximum packing density of the plane of all centrally symmetric convex shapes.[1] It was also independently discovered by Kurt Mahler in 1947.[2] It is constructed by replacing the corners of a regular octagon with a section of a hyperbola that is tangent to the two sides adjacent to the corner and asymptotic to the sides adjacent to these.","image":"Smoothed_Octagon_Simple.svg.png.webp","url":"Smoothed_octagon"}
