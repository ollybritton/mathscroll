{"title":"Newmark-beta method","summary":"The Newmark-beta method is a method of numerical integration used to solve certain differential equations.  It is widely used in numerical evaluation of the dynamic response of structures and solids such as in  finite element analysis to model dynamic systems. The method is named after Nathan M. Newmark,[1] former Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign, who developed it in 1959 for use in structural dynamics. The semi-discretized structural equation is a second order ordinary differential equation system,","image":"4c1c93f2401906eb071c78d2cc25cef161889b3c.svg","url":"Newmark-beta_method"}
