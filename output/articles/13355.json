{"title":"Relation algebra","summary":"In mathematics and abstract algebra, a relation algebra is a residuated Boolean algebra expanded with an involution called converse, a unary operation. The motivating example of a relation algebra is the algebra 2 X 2 of all binary relations on a set X, that is, subsets of the cartesian square X2, with R•S interpreted as the usual composition of binary relations R and S, and with the converse of R as the converse relation.","image":"046b918c43e05caf6624fe9b676c69ec9cd6b892.svg","url":"Relation_algebra"}
