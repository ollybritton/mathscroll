{"title":"Romanovski polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the Romanovski polynomials are one of three finite subsets of real orthogonal polynomials discovered by Vsevolod Romanovsky[1] (Romanovski in French transcription) within the context of probability distribution functions in statistics. They form an orthogonal subset of a more general family of little-known Routh polynomials introduced by Edward John Routh[2] in 1884. The term Romanovski polynomials was put forward by Raposo,[3] with reference to the so-called 'pseudo-Jacobi polynomials in Lesky's classification scheme.[4] It seems more consistent to refer to them as Romanovski–Routh polynomials, by analogy with the terms Romanovski–Bessel and Romanovski–Jacobi used by Lesky for two other sets of orthogonal polynomials.","image":"ed82334e94aa2fddb64cc744f3cfa0d2e512ff5d.svg","url":"Romanovski_polynomials"}
