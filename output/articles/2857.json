{"title":"Coiflet","summary":"Coiflets are discrete wavelets designed by Ingrid Daubechies, at the request of Ronald Coifman, to have scaling functions with vanishing moments.  The wavelet is near symmetric, their wavelet functions have N / 3 {\\displaystyle N/3} vanishing moments and scaling functions N / 3 − 1 {\\displaystyle N/3-1} , and has been used in many applications using Calderón–Zygmund operators.[1][2]","image":"3c31d5495c101b7f46401f48cab85acee220f105.svg","url":"Coiflet"}
