{"title":"Dominance-based rough set approach","summary":"The dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) is an extension of rough set theory for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), introduced by Greco, Matarazzo and Słowiński.[1][2][3] The main change compared to the classical rough sets is the substitution for the indiscernibility relation by a dominance relation, which permits one to deal with inconsistencies typical to consideration of criteria  and preference-ordered decision classes.","image":"64e0dfa478bfab4d6135147c0c60fc4524ae4c5a.svg","url":"Dominance-based_rough_set_approach"}
