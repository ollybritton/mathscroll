{"title":"Matrix ring","summary":"In abstract algebra, a matrix ring is a set of matrices with entries in a ring R that form a ring under matrix addition and matrix multiplication (Lam 1999). The set of all n × n matrices with entries in R is a matrix ring denoted Mn(R)[1][2][3][4] (alternative notations: Matn(R)[2] and Rn×n[5]).  Some sets of infinite matrices form infinite matrix rings. Any subring of a matrix ring is a matrix ring.  Over a rng, one can form matrix rngs.","image":"1440964e8fdf6149da4e2dd4d2b119744f76ecd6.svg","url":"Matrix_ring"}
