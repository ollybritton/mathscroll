{"title":"Projection-valued measure","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in functional analysis, a  projection-valued measure (PVM) is a function defined on certain subsets of a fixed set and whose values are self-adjoint projections on a fixed Hilbert space. Projection-valued measures are formally similar to real-valued measures, except that their values are self-adjoint projections rather than real numbers. As in the case of ordinary measures, it is possible to integrate complex-valued functions with respect to a PVM; the result of such an integration is a linear operator on the given Hilbert space.","image":"9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a.svg","url":"Projection-valued_measure"}
