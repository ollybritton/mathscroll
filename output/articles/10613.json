{"title":"Modulus (algebraic number theory)","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of algebraic number theory, a modulus (plural moduli) (or cycle,[1] or extended ideal[2]) is a formal product of places of a global field (i.e. an algebraic number field or a global function field).  It is used to encode ramification data for abelian extensions of a global field.","image":"64244a2ee2f4cb5d877ca4a2fec5368926d812e9.svg","url":"Modulus_(algebraic_number_theory)"}
