{"title":"Robust principal component analysis","summary":"Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is a modification of the widely used statistical procedure of principal component analysis (PCA) which works well with respect to grossly corrupted observations. A number of different approaches exist for Robust PCA, including an idealized version of Robust PCA, which aims to recover a low-rank matrix L0 from highly corrupted measurements M = L0 +S0.[1] This decomposition in low-rank and sparse matrices can be achieved by techniques such as Principal Component Pursuit method (PCP),[1] Stable PCP,[2] Quantized PCP,[3] Block based PCP,[4] and Local PCP.[5] Then, optimization methods are used such as the Augmented Lagrange Multiplier Method (ALM[6]), Alternating Direction Method (ADM[7]), Fast Alternating Minimization (FAM[8]), Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS [9][10][11]) or alternating projections (AP[12][13][14]).","image":"7420da4c864e3d5d32de46c54540881633c26350.svg","url":"Robust_principal_component_analysis"}
