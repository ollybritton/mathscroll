{"title":"LAPACK","summary":"LAPACK (\"Linear Algebra Package\") is a standard software library for numerical linear algebra. It provides routines for solving systems of linear equations and linear least squares, eigenvalue problems, and singular value decomposition. It also includes routines to implement the associated matrix factorizations such as LU, QR, Cholesky and Schur decomposition.[2] LAPACK was originally written in FORTRAN 77, but moved to Fortran 90 in version 3.2 (2008).[3] The routines handle both real and complex matrices in both single and double precision. LAPACK relies on an underlying BLAS implementation to provide efficient and portable computational building blocks for its routines.[2]:â€Š\"The BLAS as the Key to Portability\"","image":"LAPACK_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"LAPACK"}
