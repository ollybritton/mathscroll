{"title":"Fuzzy logic","summary":"Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth value of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.[1] By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.","image":"Fuzzy_logic_temperature_en.svg.png.webp","url":"Fuzzy_logic"}
