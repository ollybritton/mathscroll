{"title":"Fundamental discriminant","summary":"In mathematics, a fundamental discriminant D is an integer invariant in the theory of integral binary quadratic forms. If Q(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2 is a quadratic form with integer coefficients, then D = b2 − 4ac is the discriminant of Q(x, y). Conversely, every integer D with D ≡ 0, 1 (mod 4) is the discriminant of some binary quadratic form with integer coefficients. Thus, all such integers are referred to as discriminants in this theory.","image":"b34ec94a5b9770771dfadfcc49602490b2a4dcda.svg","url":"Fundamental_discriminant"}
