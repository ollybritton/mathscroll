{"title":"Abel's identity","summary":"In mathematics, Abel's identity (also called Abel's formula[1] or Abel's differential equation identity) is an equation that expresses the Wronskian of two solutions of a homogeneous second-order linear ordinary differential equation in terms of a coefficient of the original differential equation. The relation can be generalised to nth-order linear ordinary differential equations. The identity is named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.","image":"93e7f7df2c91be585356169b7507431fdbbf34c1.svg","url":"Abel's_identity"}
