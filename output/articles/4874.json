{"title":"Envelope (mathematics)","summary":"In geometry, an envelope of a planar family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point, and these points of tangency together form the whole envelope. Classically, a point on the envelope can be thought of as the intersection of two \"infinitesimally adjacent\" curves, meaning the limit of intersections of nearby curves. This idea can be generalized to an envelope of surfaces in space, and so on to higher dimensions.","image":"EnvelopeAnim.gif","url":"Envelope_(mathematics)"}
