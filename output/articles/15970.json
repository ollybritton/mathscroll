{"title":"Transitive closure","summary":"In mathematics, the transitive closure of a binary relation R on a set X is the smallest relation on X that contains R and is transitive. For finite sets, \"smallest\" can be taken in its usual sense, of having the fewest related pairs; for infinite sets it is the unique minimal transitive superset of R.","image":"e028d2beb97d154f3e232c390745e0c1495eb382.svg","url":"Transitive_closure"}
