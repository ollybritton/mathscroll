{"title":"Crossing number (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, the crossing number cr(G) of a graph G is the lowest number of edge crossings of a plane drawing of the graph G. For instance, a graph is planar if and only if its crossing number is zero. Determining the crossing number continues to be of great importance in graph drawing, as user studies have shown that drawing graphs with few crossings makes it easier for people to understand the drawing.[1]","image":"3-crossing_Heawood_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Crossing_number_(graph_theory)"}
