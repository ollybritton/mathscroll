{"title":"Localization of a category","summary":"In mathematics, localization of a category consists of adding to a category inverse morphisms for some collection of morphisms, constraining them to become isomorphisms. This is formally similar to the process of localization of a ring; it in general makes objects isomorphic that were not so before. In homotopy theory, for example, there are many examples of mappings that are invertible up to homotopy; and so large classes of homotopy equivalent spaces. Calculus of fractions is another name for working in a localized category.","image":"0a5276a799d94fea132d7d17a60d4a52418d20d5.svg","url":"Localization_of_a_category"}
