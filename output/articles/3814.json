{"title":"ddbar lemma","summary":"In complex geometry, the ∂ ∂ ¯ {\\displaystyle \\partial {\\bar {\\partial }}} lemma (pronounced ddbar lemma) is a mathematical lemma about the de Rham cohomology class of a complex differential form. The ∂ ∂ ¯ {\\displaystyle \\partial {\\bar {\\partial }}} -lemma is a result of Hodge theory and the Kähler identities on a compact Kähler manifold. Sometimes it is also known as the d d c {\\displaystyle dd^{c}} -lemma, due to the use of a related operator d c = − i 2 ( ∂ − ∂ ¯ ) {\\textstyle d^{c}=-{\\frac {i}{2}}(\\partial -{\\bar {\\partial }})} , with the relation between the two operators being i ∂ ∂ ¯ = d d c {\\displaystyle i\\partial {\\bar {\\partial }}=dd^{c}} and so α = d d c β {\\displaystyle \\alpha =dd^{c}\\beta } .[1]: 1.17 [2]: Lem 5.50","image":"61471a2c013227ee2956b4a17932feebcdd39dca.svg","url":"Ddbar_lemma"}
