{"title":"Hippasus","summary":"Hippasus of Metapontum (/ˈhɪpəsəs/; Greek: Ἵππασος ὁ Μεταποντῖνος, Híppasos; c. 530 – c. 450 BC)[1] was a Greek philosopher and early follower of Pythagoras.[2][3] Little is known about his life or his beliefs, but he is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers. The discovery of irrational numbers is said to have been shocking to the Pythagoreans, and Hippasus is supposed to have drowned at sea, apparently as a punishment from the gods for divulging this. However, the few ancient sources which describe this story either do not mention Hippasus by name (e.g. Pappus)[4] or alternatively tell that Hippasus drowned because he revealed how to construct a dodecahedron inside a sphere. The discovery of irrationality is not specifically ascribed to Hippasus by any ancient writer.","image":"Hippasus_Metapontinus_-_Illustrium_philosophorum_et_sapientum_effigies_ab_eorum_numistatibus_extractae.png.webp","url":"Hippasus"}
