{"title":"Hypercomputation","summary":"Hypercomputation or super-Turing computation refers to models of computation that can provide outputs that are not Turing-computable. Super-Turing computing, introduced in the early 1990's by Hava Siegelmann, refers to such neurological inspired, biological and physical realizable computing; It became the mathematical foundations of lifelong machine learning. Hypercomputation, introduced as a field of science in the late 1990s, is said to be based on the super-Turing, but it also includes constructs which are philosophical. For example, a machine that could solve the halting problem would be a hypercomputer; so too would one that can correctly evaluate every statement in Peano arithmetic.","image":"721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1.svg","url":"Hypercomputation"}
