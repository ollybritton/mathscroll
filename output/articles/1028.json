{"title":"Art Gallery Theorems and Algorithms","summary":"Art Gallery Theorems and Algorithms is a mathematical monograph on topics related to the art gallery problem, on finding positions for guards within a polygonal museum floorplan so that all points of the museum are visible to at least one guard, and on related problems in computational geometry concerning polygons. It was written by Joseph O'Rourke, and published in 1987 in the International Series of Monographs on Computer Science of the Oxford University Press.[1][2][3][4][5] Only 1000 copies were produced before the book went out of print, so to keep this material accessible O'Rourke has made a pdf version of the book available online.[6]","image":"56e8335f538b1312f23a9f7e85afa5148598d266.svg","url":"Art_Gallery_Theorems_and_Algorithms"}
