{"title":"Omnitruncation","summary":"In geometry, an omnitruncation of a convex polytope is a simple polytope of the same dimension, having a vertex for each flag of the original polytope and a facet for each face of any dimension of the original polytope. Omnitruncation is the dual operation to barycentric subdivision.[1] Because the barycentric subdivision of any polytope can be realized as another polytope,[2] the same is true for the omnitruncation of any polytope.","image":"33bf7a9781ef7f13b61691b07addc7c3b8bfb062.svg","url":"Omnitruncation"}
