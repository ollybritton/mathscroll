{"title":"Random variable","summary":"A random variable (also called random quantity, aleatory variable, or stochastic variable) is a mathematical formalization of a quantity or object which depends on random events.[1] The term 'random variable' can be misleading as it is not actually random or a variable,[2] but rather it is a mapping or a function from possible outcomes (e.g., the possible upper sides of a flipped coin such as heads H {\\displaystyle H} and tails T {\\displaystyle T} ) in a sample space (e.g., the set { H , T } {\\displaystyle \\{H,T\\}} ) to a measurable space (e.g., { − 1 , 1 } {\\displaystyle \\{-1,1\\}} in which 1 corresponding to H {\\displaystyle H} and −1 corresponding to T {\\displaystyle T} ), often to the real numbers.","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Random_variable"}
