{"title":"Explicit formulae for L-functions","summary":"In mathematics, the explicit formulae for L-functions are relations between sums  over the complex number zeroes of an L-function and sums over prime powers, introduced  by Riemann (1859)  for the Riemann zeta function.  Such explicit formulae have been applied also to questions on bounding the discriminant of an algebraic number field, and the conductor of a number field.","image":"5b36cc54b6f4b7c525440ec44ab649a21ad1d8c5.svg","url":"Explicit_formulae_for_L-functions"}
