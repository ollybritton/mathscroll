{"title":"Hyperbolic angle","summary":"In geometry, hyperbolic angle is a real number determined by the area of the corresponding hyperbolic sector of xy = 1 in Quadrant I of the Cartesian plane. The hyperbolic angle parametrises the unit hyperbola, which has hyperbolic functions as coordinates. In mathematics, hyperbolic angle is an invariant measure as it is preserved under hyperbolic rotation.","image":"Hyperbolic_sector.svg.png.webp","url":"Hyperbolic_angle"}
