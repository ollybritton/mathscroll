{"title":"Ryll-Nardzewski fixed-point theorem","summary":"In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Ryll-Nardzewski fixed-point theorem states that if E {\\displaystyle E} is a normed vector space and K {\\displaystyle K} is a nonempty convex subset of E {\\displaystyle E} that is compact under the weak topology, then every group (or equivalently: every semigroup) of affine isometries of K {\\displaystyle K} has at least one fixed point. (Here, a fixed point of a set of maps is a point that is fixed by each map in the set.)","image":"4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b.svg","url":"Ryll-Nardzewski_fixed-point_theorem"}
