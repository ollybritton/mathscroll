{"title":"Almost periodic function","summary":"In mathematics, an almost periodic function is, loosely speaking, a function of a real number that is periodic to within any desired level of accuracy, given suitably long, well-distributed \"almost-periods\". The concept was first studied by Harald Bohr and later generalized by Vyacheslav Stepanov, Hermann Weyl and Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch, amongst others. There is also a notion of almost periodic functions on locally compact abelian groups, first studied by John von Neumann.","image":"3e444d0a160cc8b4f7f7630f1355f529d79b0094.svg","url":"Almost_periodic_function"}
