{"title":"Representation theory of the symmetric group","summary":"In mathematics, the representation theory of the symmetric group is a particular case of the representation theory of finite groups, for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from symmetric function theory to quantum chemistry studies of atoms, molecules and solids.[1][2]","image":"d6d9e884ebc05843e47cc082cff9601e8b94f1c3.svg","url":"Representation_theory_of_the_symmetric_group"}
