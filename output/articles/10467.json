{"title":"Milner–Rado paradox","summary":"In set theory, a branch of mathematics, the Milner – Rado paradox, found by Eric Charles Milner and Richard Rado (1965), states that every ordinal number α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } less than the successor κ + {\\displaystyle \\kappa ^{+}} of some cardinal number κ {\\displaystyle \\kappa } can be written as the union of sets X 1 , X 2 , . . . {\\displaystyle X_{1},X_{2},...} where X n {\\displaystyle X_{n}} is of order type at most κn for n a positive integer.","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg","url":"Milner–Rado_paradox"}
