{"title":"Margin of error","summary":"The margin of error is a statistic expressing the amount of random sampling error in the results of a survey. The larger the margin of error, the less confidence one should have that a poll result would reflect the result of a census of the entire population. The margin of error will be positive whenever a population is incompletely sampled and the outcome measure has positive variance, which is to say, whenever the measure varies.","image":"Margin-of-error-95.svg.png.webp","url":"Margin_of_error"}
