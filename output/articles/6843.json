{"title":"Hamiltonian path problem","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory the Hamiltonian path problem and the Hamiltonian cycle problem are problems of determining whether a Hamiltonian path (a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once) or a Hamiltonian cycle exists in a given graph (whether directed or undirected). Both problems are NP-complete.[1]","image":"a84e121bb4937757a3b828d5484262e84b2c4a52.svg","url":"Hamiltonian_path_problem"}
