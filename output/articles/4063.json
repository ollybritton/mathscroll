{"title":"Difference algebra","summary":"Difference algebra is a branch of mathematics concerned with the study of difference (or functional) equations from the algebraic point of view. Difference algebra is analogous to differential algebra but concerned with difference equations rather than differential equations. As an independent subject it was initiated by Joseph Ritt and his student Richard Cohn.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Difference_algebra"}
