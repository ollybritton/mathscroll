{"title":"Steiner inellipse","summary":"In geometry, the Steiner inellipse,[1] midpoint inellipse, or midpoint ellipse of a triangle is the unique ellipse inscribed in the triangle and tangent to the sides at their midpoints. It is an example of an inellipse. By comparison the inscribed circle and Mandart inellipse of a triangle are other inconics that are tangent to the sides, but not at the midpoints unless the triangle is equilateral. The Steiner inellipse is attributed by DÃ¶rrie[2] to Jakob Steiner, and a proof of its uniqueness is given by Dan Kalman.[3]","image":"Steiner_Inellipse.svg.png.webp","url":"Steiner_inellipse"}
