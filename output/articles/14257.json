{"title":"Shapiro's lemma","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the areas of abstract algebra dealing with group cohomology or relative homological algebra, Shapiro's lemma, also known as the Eckmannâ€“Shapiro lemma, relates extensions of modules over one ring to extensions over another, especially the group ring of a group and of a subgroup. It thus relates the group cohomology with respect to a group to the cohomology with respect to a subgroup. Shapiro's lemma is named after Arnold S. Shapiro, who proved it in 1961;[1] however, Beno Eckmann had discovered it earlier, in 1953.[2]","image":"2900cbaf590384c31585d3676dd16fd858224e82.svg","url":"Shapiro's_lemma"}
