{"title":"Hilbert–Pólya conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture states that the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function correspond to eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator. It is a possible approach to the Riemann hypothesis, by means of spectral theory.","image":"db573a4f2b83955f507228bde4180eff79c0ae4b.svg","url":"Hilbert–Pólya_conjecture"}
