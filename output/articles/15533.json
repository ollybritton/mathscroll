{"title":"Taut foliation","summary":"In mathematics, tautness is a rigidity property of foliations. A taut foliation is a codimension 1 foliation of a closed manifold with the property that every leaf meets a transverse circle.[1]: 155  By transverse circle, is meant a closed loop that is always transverse to the tangent field of the foliation.","image":"103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8.svg","url":"Taut_foliation"}
