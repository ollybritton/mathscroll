{"title":"Color-coding","summary":"In computer science and graph theory, the term color-coding refers to an algorithmic technique which is useful in the discovery of network motifs. For example, it can be used to detect a simple path of length k in a given graph. The traditional color-coding algorithm is probabilistic, but it can be derandomized without much overhead in the running time.","image":"4bd9d95e00f8190c021f4fe3e00102d5bb5105f0.svg","url":"Color-coding"}
