{"title":"Function of several complex variables","summary":"The theory of functions of several complex variables is the branch of mathematics dealing with complex-valued functions. The name of the field dealing with the properties of function of several complex variables is called several complex variables (and analytic space), that has become a common name for that whole field of study and Mathematics Subject Classification has, as a top-level heading. A function f : ( z 1 , z 2 , … , z n ) → f ( z 1 , z 2 , … , z n ) {\\displaystyle f:(z_{1},z_{2},\\ldots ,z_{n})\\rightarrow f(z_{1},z_{2},\\ldots ,z_{n})} is n-tuples of complex numbers, classically studied on the complex coordinate space C n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{n}} .","image":"fc969961e78a9807780177bb44420d0f0b0513f0.svg","url":"Function_of_several_complex_variables"}
