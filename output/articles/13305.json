{"title":"Regular complex polygon","summary":"In geometry, a regular complex polygon is a generalization of a regular polygon in real space to an analogous structure in a complex Hilbert space, where each real dimension is accompanied by an imaginary one. A regular polygon exists in 2 real dimensions, R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} , while a complex polygon exists in two complex dimensions, C 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{2}} , which can be given real representations in 4 dimensions, R 4 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{4}} , which then must be projected down to 2 or 3 real dimensions to be visualized. A complex polygon is generalized as a complex polytope in C n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{n}} .","image":"e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd.svg","url":"Regular_complex_polygon"}
