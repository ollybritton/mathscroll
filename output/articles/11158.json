{"title":"Nonagonal number","summary":"A nonagonal number (or an enneagonal number) is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the nonagon (a nine-sided polygon).[1] However, unlike the triangular and square numbers, the patterns involved in the construction of nonagonal numbers are not rotationally symmetrical. Specifically, the  nth nonagonal number counts the number of dots in a pattern of n nested nonagons, all sharing a common corner, where the ith nonagon in the pattern has sides made of i dots spaced one unit apart from each other. The nonagonal number for n is given by the formula:[2]","image":"853d404ff8b7eb9c63729b0a1b304dbbccaf8cc6.svg","url":"Nonagonal_number"}
