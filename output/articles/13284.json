{"title":"Reflection theorem","summary":"In algebraic number theory, a reflection theorem or Spiegelungssatz (German for reflection theorem – see Spiegel and Satz) is one of a collection of theorems linking the sizes of different ideal class groups (or ray class groups), or the sizes of different isotypic components of a class group.  The original example is due to Ernst Eduard Kummer, who showed that the class number of the cyclotomic field Q ( ζ p ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} \\left(\\zeta _{p}\\right)} , with p a prime number, will be divisible by p if the class number of the maximal real subfield Q ( ζ p ) + {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} \\left(\\zeta _{p}\\right)^{+}} is.  Another example is due to Scholz.[1]  A simplified version of his theorem states that if 3 divides the class number of a real quadratic field Q ( d ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} \\left({\\sqrt {d}}\\right)} , then 3 also divides the class number of the imaginary quadratic field Q ( − 3 d ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} \\left({\\sqrt {-3d}}\\right)} .","image":"def558978b8b52abdfb1962e8c06f6c0707ccfe6.svg","url":"Reflection_theorem"}
