{"title":"Nevanlinna theory","summary":"In the mathematical field of complex analysis, Nevanlinna theory is part of the theory of meromorphic functions. It was devised in 1925, by Rolf Nevanlinna.  Hermann Weyl called it \"one of the few great mathematical events of (the twentieth) century.\"[1] The theory describes the asymptotic distribution of solutions of the equation f(z) = a, as a varies. A fundamental tool is the Nevanlinna characteristic T(r, f) which measures the rate of growth of a meromorphic function.","image":"b48d1662d4d1d1a24a8fb00dbebcbd12a766c81c.svg","url":"Nevanlinna_theory"}
