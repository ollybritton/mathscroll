{"title":"Schreier coset graph","summary":"In the area of mathematics called combinatorial group theory, the Schreier coset graph is a graph associated with a group G, a generating set {xi : i in I } of G, and a subgroup H ≤ G. The Schreier graph encodes the abstract structure of a group modulo an equivalence relation formed by the coset.","image":"fe8aa65cb708ac6c9d40b8c06db6f8621832d477.svg","url":"Schreier_coset_graph"}
