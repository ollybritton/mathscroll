{"title":"Saccheri quadrilateral","summary":"A Saccheri quadrilateral (also known as a Khayyam–Saccheri quadrilateral) is a quadrilateral with two equal sides perpendicular to the base. It is named after Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri, who used it extensively in his book Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus (literally Euclid Freed of Every Flaw) first published in 1733, an attempt to prove the parallel postulate using the method Reductio ad absurdum. The Saccheri quadrilateral may occasionally be referred to as the Khayyam–Saccheri quadrilateral, in reference to the 11th century Persian scholar Omar Khayyam.[1]","image":"Saccheri_quads.svg.png.webp","url":"Saccheri_quadrilateral"}
