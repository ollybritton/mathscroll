{"title":"Albert algebra","summary":"In mathematics, an Albert algebra is a 27-dimensional exceptional Jordan algebra. They are named after Abraham Adrian Albert, who pioneered the study of non-associative algebras, usually working over the real numbers. Over the real numbers, there are three such Jordan algebras up to isomorphism.[1]  One of them, which was first mentioned by Pascual Jordan, John von Neumann, and Eugene Wigner (1934) and studied by Albert (1934),  is the set of 3×3 self-adjoint matrices over the octonions, equipped with the binary operation","image":"503b9a38da4b2a895e6828b5912dd0ab4c2fe55c.svg","url":"Albert_algebra"}
