{"title":"Abhyankar–Moh theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Abhyankar–Moh theorem states that if L {\\displaystyle L} is a complex line in the complex affine plane C 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{2}} , then every embedding of L {\\displaystyle L} into C 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{2}} extends to an automorphism of the plane. It is named after Shreeram Shankar Abhyankar and Tzuong-Tsieng Moh, who published it in 1975. More generally, the same theorem applies to lines and planes over any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and to certain well-behaved subsets of higher-dimensional complex affine spaces.","image":"103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8.svg","url":"Abhyankar–Moh_theorem"}
