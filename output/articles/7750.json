{"title":"Inellipse","summary":"In triangle geometry, an inellipse is an ellipse that touches the three sides of a triangle. The simplest example is the incircle. Further important inellipses are the Steiner inellipse, which touches the triangle at the midpoints of its sides, the Mandart inellipse and Brocard inellipse (see examples section). For any triangle there exist an infinite number of inellipses.","image":"Inellipse-1.svg.png.webp","url":"Inellipse"}
