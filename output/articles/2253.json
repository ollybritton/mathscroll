{"title":"Carlson symmetric form","summary":"In mathematics, the Carlson symmetric forms of elliptic integrals are a small canonical set of elliptic integrals to which all others may be reduced. They are a modern alternative to the Legendre forms. The Legendre forms may be expressed in terms of the Carlson forms and vice versa.","image":"250e82388d2ba863d8ac2e799388aa7641c669e0.svg","url":"Carlson_symmetric_form"}
