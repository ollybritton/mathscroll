{"title":"Mode (statistics)","summary":"The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data values.[1] If X is a discrete random variable, the mode is the value x at which the probability mass function takes its maximum value (i.e, x=argmaxxi P(X = xi)). In other words, it is the value that is most likely to be sampled.","image":"Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg.png.webp","url":"Mode_(statistics)"}
