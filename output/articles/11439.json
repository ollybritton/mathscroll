{"title":"Operator monotone function","summary":"In linear algebra, the operator monotone function is an important type of real-valued function, first described by Charles Löwner in 1934.[1] It is closely allied to the operator concave and operator concave functions, and is encountered in operator theory and in matrix theory, and led to the Löwner–Heinz inequality.[2][3]","image":"d0048c7d78f42a3cd038906db745c64ff1ed6aa6.svg","url":"Operator_monotone_function"}
