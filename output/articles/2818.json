{"title":"Cocycle category","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the cocycle category of objects X, Y in a model category is a category in which the objects are pairs of maps X ← f Z → g Y {\\displaystyle X{\\overset {f}{\\leftarrow }}Z{\\overset {g}{\\rightarrow }}Y} and the morphisms are obvious commutative diagrams between them.[1] It is denoted by H ( X , Y ) {\\displaystyle H(X,Y)} . (It may also be defined using the language of 2-category.)","image":"7f82a92de4bb6ac485cbbf6dfa8e3ae4fa21ea69.svg","url":"Cocycle_category"}
