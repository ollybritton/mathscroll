{"title":"Fractional Brownian motion","summary":"In probability theory, fractional Brownian motion (fBm), also called a fractal Brownian motion, is a generalization of Brownian motion.  Unlike classical Brownian motion, the increments of fBm need not be independent.  fBm is a continuous-time Gaussian process BH(t) on [0, T], that starts at zero, has expectation zero for all t in [0, T], and has the following covariance function:","image":"914fd4046e7a501aba142e475493c40be2888036.svg","url":"Fractional_Brownian_motion"}
