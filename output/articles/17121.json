{"title":"Zadoff–Chu sequence","summary":"A Zadoff–Chu (ZC) sequence, also referred to as Chu sequence or Frank–Zadoff–Chu (FZC) sequence,[1]: 152  is a complex-valued mathematical sequence which, when applied to a signal, gives rise to a new signal of constant amplitude. When cyclically shifted versions of a Zadoff–Chu sequence are imposed upon a signal the resulting set of signals detected at the receiver are uncorrelated with one another.","image":"Zadoff_Chu_7_353.png.webp","url":"Zadoff–Chu_sequence"}
