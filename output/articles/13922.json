{"title":"Scale (ratio)","summary":"The scale ratio of a model represents the proportional ratio of a linear dimension of the model to the same feature of the original. Examples include a 3-dimensional scale model of a building or the scale drawings of the elevations or plans of a building.[1] In such cases the scale is dimensionless and exact throughout the model or drawing.","image":"Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg.webp","url":"Scale_(ratio)"}
