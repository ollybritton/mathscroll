{"title":"Borel conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, specifically geometric topology, the Borel conjecture (named for Armand Borel) asserts that an aspherical closed manifold is determined by its fundamental group, up to homeomorphism.  It is a rigidity conjecture, asserting that a weak, algebraic notion of equivalence (namely, homotopy equivalence) should imply a stronger, topological notion (namely, homeomorphism).","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Borel_conjecture"}
