{"title":"Calculus of variations","summary":"The calculus of variations (or Variational Calculus) is a field of mathematical analysis that uses variations, which are small changes in functions and functionals, to find maxima and minima of functionals: mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers.[lower-alpha 1] Functionals are often expressed as definite integrals involving functions and their derivatives. Functions that maximize or minimize functionals may be found using the Eulerâ€“Lagrange equation of the calculus of variations.","image":"b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d.svg","url":"Calculus_of_variations"}
