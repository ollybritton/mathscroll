{"title":"Focused proof","summary":"In mathematical logic, focused proofs are a family of analytic proofs that arise through goal-directed proof-search, and are a topic of study in structural proof theory and reductive logic. They form the most general definition of goal-directed proof-searchâ€”in which someone chooses a formula and performs hereditary reductions until the result meets some condition. The extremal case where reduction only terminates when axioms are reached forms the sub-family of uniform proofs.[1]","image":"5092176ead49fad1831b66b924957541ea52f63a.svg","url":"Focused_proof"}
