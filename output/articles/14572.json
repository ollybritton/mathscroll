{"title":"Smith number","summary":"In number theory, a Smith number is a composite number for which, in a given number base, the sum of its digits is equal to the sum of the digits in its prime factorization in the given number base. In the case of numbers that are not square-free, the factorization is written without exponents, writing the repeated factor as many times as needed.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Smith_number"}
