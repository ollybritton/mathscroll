{"title":"Higher-order logic","summary":"In mathematics and logic, a higher-order logic is a form of predicate logic that is distinguished from first-order logic by additional quantifiers and, sometimes, stronger semantics. Higher-order logics with their standard semantics are more expressive, but their model-theoretic properties are less well-behaved than those of first-order logic.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Higher-order_logic"}
