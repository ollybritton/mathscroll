{"title":"PTAS reduction","summary":"In computational complexity theory, a PTAS reduction is an approximation-preserving reduction that is often used to perform reductions between solutions to optimization problems. It preserves the property that a problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) and is used to define completeness for certain classes of optimization problems such as APX. Notationally, if there is a PTAS reduction from a problem A to a problem B, we write A â‰¤ PTAS B {\\displaystyle {\\text{A}}\\leq _{\\text{PTAS}}{\\text{B}}} .","image":"20866aa70db47e6c56145f62abb9c18d392f8708.svg","url":"PTAS_reduction"}
