{"title":"Brown–Forsythe test","summary":"The Brown–Forsythe test is a statistical test for the equality of group variances based on performing an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on a transformation of the response variable. When a one-way ANOVA is performed, samples are assumed to have been drawn from distributions with equal variance. If this assumption is not valid, the resulting F-test is invalid. The Brown–Forsythe test statistic is the F statistic resulting from an ordinary one-way analysis of variance on the absolute deviations of the groups or treatments data  from their individual medians.[1]","image":"a532de09e5d0602b45a07359bb61271e1276c682.svg","url":"Brown–Forsythe_test"}
