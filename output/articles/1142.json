{"title":"Augmented triangular prism","summary":"In geometry, the augmented triangular prism is one of the Johnson solids (J49). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by augmenting a triangular prism by attaching a square pyramid (J1) to one of its equatorial faces. The resulting solid bears a superficial resemblance to the gyrobifastigium (J26), the difference being that the latter is constructed by attaching a second triangular prism, rather than a square pyramid.","image":"Augmented_triangular_prism.png.webp","url":"Augmented_triangular_prism"}
