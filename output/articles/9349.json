{"title":"Linear canonical transformation","summary":"In Hamiltonian mechanics, the linear canonical transformation (LCT) is a family of integral transforms that generalizes many classical transforms. It has 4 parameters and 1 constraint, so it is a 3-dimensional family, and can be visualized as the action of the special linear group SL2(R) on the timeâ€“frequency plane (domain). As this defines the original function up to a sign, this translates into an action of its double cover on the original function space.","image":"a8fef5de5175b9fc1ebf70ae380206c96a19d86f.svg","url":"Linear_canonical_transformation"}
