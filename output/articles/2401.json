{"title":"Cederbaum's maximum flow theorem","summary":"Cederbaum's theorem[1] defines hypothetical analog electrical networks which will automatically produce a solution to the minimum s–t cut problem.  Alternatively,  simulation of such a network will also produce a solution to the minimum s–t cut problem.  This article gives basic definitions, a statement of the theorem and a proof of the theorem.   The presentation in this article closely follows the presentation of the theorem in the original publication.","image":"4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b.svg","url":"Cederbaum's_maximum_flow_theorem"}
