{"title":"Akivis algebra","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular the study of algebra, an Akivis algebra is a nonassociative algebra equipped with a binary operator, the commutator [ x , y ] {\\displaystyle [x,y]} and a ternary operator, the associator [ x , y , z ] {\\displaystyle [x,y,z]} that satisfy a particular relationship known as the Akivis identity. They are named in honour of Russian mathematician Maks A. Akivis.","image":"1b7bd6292c6023626c6358bfd3943a031b27d663.svg","url":"Akivis_algebra"}
