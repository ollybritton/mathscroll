{"title":"Modular representation theory","summary":"Modular representation theory is a branch of mathematics, and is the part of representation theory that studies linear representations of finite groups over a field K of positive characteristic p, necessarily a prime number. As well as having applications to group theory, modular representations arise naturally in other branches of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, coding theory, combinatorics and number theory.","image":"5d3656fcfd6b21424dc79ced1b6feda742153269.svg","url":"Modular_representation_theory"}
