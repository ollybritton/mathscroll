{"title":"K-stability","summary":"In mathematics, and especially differential and algebraic geometry, K-stability is an algebro-geometric stability condition, for complex manifolds and complex algebraic varieties. The notion of K-stability was first introduced by Gang Tian[1] and reformulated more algebraically later by Simon Donaldson.[2] The definition was inspired by a comparison to geometric invariant theory (GIT) stability.  In the special case of Fano varieties, K-stability precisely characterises the existence of Kähler–Einstein metrics. More generally, on any compact complex manifold, K-stability is conjectured to be equivalent to the existence of constant scalar curvature Kähler metrics (cscK metrics).","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"K-stability"}
