{"title":"Free object","summary":"In mathematics, the idea of a free object is one of the basic concepts of abstract algebra. Informally, a free object over a set A can be thought of as being a \"generic\" algebraic structure over A: the only equations that hold between elements of the free object are those that follow from the defining axioms of the algebraic structure. Examples include free groups, tensor algebras, or free lattices.","image":"5ccf7c31514c569051f40674c07a3006194e3809.svg","url":"Free_object"}
