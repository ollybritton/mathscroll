{"title":"Gauss–Kuzmin–Wirsing operator","summary":"In mathematics, the Gauss–Kuzmin–Wirsing operator is the transfer operator of the Gauss map that takes a positive number to the fractional part of its reciprocal. (This is not the same as the Gauss map in differential geometry.) It is named after Carl Gauss, Rodion Kuzmin, and Eduard Wirsing. It occurs in the study of continued fractions; it is also related to the Riemann zeta function.","image":"Gauss_function.svg.png.webp","url":"Gauss–Kuzmin–Wirsing_operator"}
