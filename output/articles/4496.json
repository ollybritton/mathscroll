{"title":"Dual q-Krawtchouk polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the dual q-Krawtchouk polynomials  are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme. Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties.","image":"9ba6585d6f5292ee86eaa9b5b25dd2985cd35ddb.svg","url":"Dual_q-Krawtchouk_polynomials"}
