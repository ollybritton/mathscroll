{"title":"Hermite interpolation","summary":"In numerical analysis, Hermite interpolation, named after Charles Hermite, is a method of polynomial interpolation, which generalizes Lagrange interpolation. Lagrange interpolation allows computing a polynomial of degree less than n that takes the same value at n given points as a given function. Instead, Hermite interpolation computes a polynomial of degree less than mn such that the polynomial and its m − 1 first derivatives have the same values at n given points as a given function and its m − 1 first derivatives.","image":"e23111f050c1fbc3d04b6ee76f3bbef1b51ed6ea.svg","url":"Hermite_interpolation"}
