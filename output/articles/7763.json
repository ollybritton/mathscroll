{"title":"Infinite-order apeirogonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the infinite-order apeirogonal tiling is a regular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It has Schläfli symbol of {∞,∞}, which means it has countably infinitely many apeirogons around all its ideal vertices.","image":"H2_tiling_2ii-1.png.webp","url":"Infinite-order_apeirogonal_tiling"}
