{"title":"Octacube (sculpture)","summary":"The Octacube is a large, stainless steel sculpture displayed in the mathematics department of Pennsylvania State University in State College, PA. The sculpture represents a mathematical object called the 24-cell or \"octacube\". Because a real 24-cell is four-dimensional, the artwork is actually a projection into the three-dimensional world.","image":"Ocnacube.jpg.webp","url":"Octacube_(sculpture)"}
