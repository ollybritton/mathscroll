{"title":"Residue at infinity","summary":"In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, the residue at infinity is a residue of a holomorphic function on an annulus having an infinite external radius.  The infinity âˆž {\\displaystyle \\infty } is a point added to the local space C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } in order to render it compact (in this case it is a one-point compactification). This space denoted C ^ {\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\mathbb {C} }}} is isomorphic to the Riemann sphere.[1] One can use the residue at infinity to calculate some integrals.","image":"c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21.svg","url":"Residue_at_infinity"}
