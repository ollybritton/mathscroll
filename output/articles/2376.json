{"title":"Cauchy–Binet formula","summary":"In mathematics, specifically linear algebra, the Cauchy–Binet formula, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Jacques Philippe Marie Binet, is an identity for the determinant of the product of two rectangular matrices of transpose shapes (so that the product is well-defined and square). It generalizes the statement that the determinant of a product of square matrices is equal to the product of their determinants. The formula is valid for matrices with the entries  from any commutative ring.","image":"68472f98dfef1e86aa338b87e6218653714a5f86.svg","url":"Cauchy–Binet_formula"}
