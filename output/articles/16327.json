{"title":"Unbiased estimation of standard deviation","summary":"In statistics and in particular statistical theory, unbiased estimation of a standard deviation is the calculation from a statistical sample of an estimated value of the standard deviation (a measure of statistical dispersion) of a population of values, in such a way that the expected value of the calculation equals the true value.  Except in some important situations, outlined later, the task has little relevance to applications of statistics since its need is avoided by standard procedures, such as the use of significance tests and confidence intervals, or by using Bayesian analysis.","image":"ce14a74d8d305f973eed77267b4d0bfab7f71022.svg","url":"Unbiased_estimation_of_standard_deviation"}
