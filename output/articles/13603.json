{"title":"Ringed topos","summary":"In mathematics, a ringed topos is a generalization of a ringed space; that is, the notion is obtained by replacing a \"topological space\" by a \"topos\". The notion of a ringed topos has applications to deformation theory in algebraic geometry (cf. cotangent complex) and the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics. In the latter subject, a Bohr topos is a ringed topos that plays the role of a quantum phase space.[1][2]","image":"df82683ad84e501f25db687346051069537968c2.svg","url":"Ringed_topos"}
