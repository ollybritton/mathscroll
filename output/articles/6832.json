{"title":"Ham sandwich theorem","summary":"In mathematical measure theory, for every positive integer n the ham sandwich theorem states that given n measurable \"objects\" in n-dimensional Euclidean space, it is possible to divide each one of them in half (with respect to their measure, e.g. volume) with a single (n âˆ’ 1)-dimensional hyperplane. This is even possible if the objects overlap.","image":"Ham_sandwich.jpg.webp","url":"Ham_sandwich_theorem"}
