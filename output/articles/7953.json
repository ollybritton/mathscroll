{"title":"Interval order","summary":"In mathematics, especially order theory, the interval order for a collection of intervals on the real line is the partial order corresponding to their left-to-right precedence relation—one interval, I1, being considered less than another, I2, if I1 is completely to the left of I2. More formally, a countable poset P = ( X , ≤ ) {\\displaystyle P=(X,\\leq )} is an interval order if and only if there exists a bijection from X {\\displaystyle X} to a set of real intervals, so x i ↦ ( ℓ i , r i ) {\\displaystyle x_{i}\\mapsto (\\ell _{i},r_{i})} , such that for any x i , x j ∈ X {\\displaystyle x_{i},x_{j}\\in X} we have x i < x j {\\displaystyle x_{i}<x_{j}} in P {\\displaystyle P} exactly when r i < ℓ j {\\displaystyle r_{i}<\\ell _{j}} . Such posets may be equivalently characterized as those with no induced subposet isomorphic to the pair of two-element chains, in other words as the ( 2 + 2 ) {\\displaystyle (2+2)} -free posets .[1]","image":"b3d308cfda49d33ea6e6b5216275b21772d644ba.svg","url":"Interval_order"}
