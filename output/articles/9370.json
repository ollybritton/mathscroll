{"title":"Linear map","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in linear algebra, a linear map (also called a linear mapping, linear transformation, vector space homomorphism, or in some contexts linear function) is a mapping V â†’ W {\\displaystyle V\\to W} between two  vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. The same names and the same definition are also used for the more general case of modules over a ring; see Module homomorphism.","image":"98b0589697c495103fca82279cf0c84b944b62b6.svg","url":"Linear_map"}
