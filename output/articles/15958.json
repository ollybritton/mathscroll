{"title":"Transfer matrix","summary":"In applied mathematics, the transfer matrix is a formulation in terms of a block-Toeplitz matrix of the two-scale equation, which characterizes refinable functions. Refinable functions play an important role in wavelet theory and finite element theory.","image":"b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a.svg","url":"Transfer_matrix"}
