{"title":"Pseudoconvexity","summary":"In mathematics, more precisely in the theory of functions of several complex variables, a pseudoconvex set is a special type of open set in the n-dimensional complex space Cn. Pseudoconvex sets are important, as they allow for classification of domains of holomorphy.","image":"a669d69f08cb6302f1ba79303e9c98c14cb13083.svg","url":"Pseudoconvexity"}
