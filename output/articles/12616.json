{"title":"Projective line over a ring","summary":"In mathematics, the projective line over a ring is an extension of the concept of projective line over a field. Given a ring A with 1, the projective line P(A) over A consists of points identified by projective coordinates.  Let U be the group of units of A; pairs (a, b) and (c, d) from A Ã— A are related when there is a u in U such that ua = c and ub = d. This relation is an equivalence relation. A typical equivalence class is written U[a, b].","image":"Projectivisation_F7P^1.svg.png.webp","url":"Projective_line_over_a_ring"}
