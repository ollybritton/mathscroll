{"title":"Random geometric graph","summary":"In graph theory, a random geometric graph (RGG) is the mathematically simplest spatial network, namely an undirected graph constructed by randomly placing N nodes in some metric space (according to a specified probability distribution) and connecting two nodes by a link if and only if their distance is in a given range, e.g. smaller than a certain neighborhood radius, r.","image":"Internet_map_1024.jpg.webp","url":"Random_geometric_graph"}
