{"title":"Bratteli diagram","summary":"In mathematics, a Bratteli diagram is a combinatorial structure: a graph composed of vertices labelled by positive integers (\"level\") and unoriented edges between vertices having levels differing by one.  The notion was introduced by Ola Bratteli[1] in 1972 in the theory of operator algebras to describe directed sequences of finite-dimensional algebras: it played an important role in Elliott's classification of AF-algebras and the theory of subfactors.  Subsequently Anatoly Vershik associated dynamical systems with infinite paths in such graphs.[2]","image":"Sample_Bratteli_diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Bratteli_diagram"}
