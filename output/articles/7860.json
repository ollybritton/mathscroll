{"title":"Integer points in convex polyhedra","summary":"The study of integer points in convex polyhedra[1] is motivated by questions such as \"how many nonnegative integer-valued solutions does a system of linear equations with nonnegative coefficients have\" or \"how many solutions does an integer linear program have\". Counting integer points in polyhedra or other questions about them arise in representation theory, commutative algebra, algebraic geometry,  statistics, and computer science.[2]","image":"IP_polytope_with_LP_relaxation.svg.png.webp","url":"Integer_points_in_convex_polyhedra"}
