{"title":"Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation","summary":"The Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc, pronounced PET-see; the S is silent), is a suite of data structures and routines developed by Argonne National Laboratory for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations.  It employs the Message Passing Interface  (MPI) standard for all message-passing communication.  PETSc is the worldâ€™s most widely used parallel numerical software library for partial differential equations and sparse matrix computations. PETSc received an R&D 100 Award in 2009.[1][2][3] The PETSc Core Development Group won the SIAM/ACM Prize in Computational Science and Engineering for 2015.[4]","image":"Library_structure.svg.png.webp","url":"Portable,_Extensible_Toolkit_for_Scientific_Computation"}
