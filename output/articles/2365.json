{"title":"Cauchy's theorem (group theory)","summary":"In mathematics, specifically group theory, Cauchy's theorem states that if G is a finite group and p is a prime number dividing the order of G (the number of elements in G), then G contains an element of order p. That is, there is x in G such that p is the smallest positive integer with xp = e, where e is the identity element of G. It is named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who discovered it in 1845.[1][2]","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Cauchy's_theorem_(group_theory)"}
