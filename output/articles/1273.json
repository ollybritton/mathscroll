{"title":"Baker's theorem","summary":"In transcendental number theory, a mathematical discipline, Baker's theorem gives a lower bound for the absolute value of linear combinations of logarithms of algebraic numbers. The result, proved by Alan BakerÂ (1966, 1967a, 1967b), subsumed many earlier results in transcendental number theory and solved a problem posed by Alexander Gelfond nearly fifteen years earlier.[1] Baker used this to prove the transcendence of many numbers, to derive effective bounds for the solutions of some Diophantine equations, and to solve the class number problem of finding all imaginary quadratic fields with class number 1.","image":"5c54e1ea2df1f3d345e5ecea9313712f999d3955.svg","url":"Baker's_theorem"}
