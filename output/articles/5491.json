{"title":"Fisher information metric","summary":"In information geometry, the Fisher information metric is a particular Riemannian metric which can be defined on a smooth statistical manifold, i.e., a smooth manifold whose points are probability measures defined on a common probability space. It can be used to calculate the informational difference between measurements.","image":"26bd3490e6e6d16b755dd2b67603a9270967f8c7.svg","url":"Fisher_information_metric"}
