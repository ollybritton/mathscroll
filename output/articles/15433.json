{"title":"Szemerédi's theorem","summary":"In arithmetic combinatorics, Szemerédi's theorem is a result concerning arithmetic progressions in subsets of the integers. In 1936, Erdős and Turán conjectured[1] that every set of integers A with positive natural density contains a k-term arithmetic progression for every k. Endre Szemerédi proved the conjecture in 1975.","image":"d50ccb39a41a63cf586f8326c92cec62f072f3c2.svg","url":"Szemerédi's_theorem"}
