{"title":"SQ-universal group","summary":"In mathematics, in the realm of group theory, a countable group is said to be SQ-universal if every countable group can be embedded in one of its quotient groups. SQ-universality can be thought of as a measure of largeness or complexity of a group.","image":"0686a534d232457fe251771d864784e1385d12a0.svg","url":"SQ-universal_group"}
