{"title":"Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem","summary":"In statistics, the Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem (also the Fisher–Tippett theorem or the extreme value theorem) is a general result in extreme value theory regarding asymptotic distribution of extreme order statistics. The maximum of a sample of iid random variables after proper renormalization can only converge in distribution to one of 3 possible distributions, the Gumbel distribution, the Fréchet distribution, or the Weibull distribution. Credit for the extreme value theorem and its convergence details are given to Fréchet (1927),[1] Fisher and  Tippett (1928),[2] Mises (1936)[3][4] and Gnedenko (1943).[5]","image":"d67872301909a9d739e265252ad0c7339cead069.svg","url":"Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko_theorem"}
