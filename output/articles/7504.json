{"title":"Hypercomplex analysis","summary":"In mathematics, hypercomplex analysis is the basic extension of real analysis and complex analysis to the study of functions where the argument is a hypercomplex number. The first instance is functions of a quaternion variable, where the argument is a quaternion (in this case, the sub-field of hypercomplex analysis is called quaternionic analysis).  A second instance involves functions of a motor variable where arguments are split-complex numbers.","image":"af47781acb103f3ade67b395b6441d17278a7c38.svg","url":"Hypercomplex_analysis"}
