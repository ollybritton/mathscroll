{"title":"John Radford Young","summary":"John Radford Young (born 8 April 1799, in Southwark â€“ 5 March 1885, in Peckham)[1] was an English mathematician, professor and author, who was almost entirely self-educated. He was born of humble parents in London. At an early age he became acquainted with Olinthus Gilbert Gregory, who perceived his mathematical ability and assisted him in his studies. In 1823, while working in a private establishment for the deaf, he published An Elementary Treatise on Algebra with a dedication to Gregory. This treatise was followed by a series of elementary works, in which, following in the steps of Robert Woodhouse, Young familiarized English students with continental methods of mathematical analysis.","image":"Wikisource-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"John_Radford_Young"}
