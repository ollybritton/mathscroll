{"title":"Linear code","summary":"In coding theory, a linear code is an error-correcting code for which any linear combination of codewords is also a codeword. Linear codes are traditionally partitioned into block codes and convolutional codes, although turbo codes can be seen as a hybrid of these two types.[1] Linear codes allow for more efficient encoding and decoding algorithms than other codes (cf. syndrome decoding).","image":"0a630603c6f2f8f58f5d1fb9ef1b9ad194e258a2.svg","url":"Linear_code"}
