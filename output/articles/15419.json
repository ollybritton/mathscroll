{"title":"System U","summary":"In mathematical logic, System U and System U− are pure type systems, i.e. special forms of a typed lambda calculus with an arbitrary number of sorts, axioms and rules (or dependencies between the sorts). They were both proved inconsistent by Jean-Yves Girard in 1972.[1] This result led to the realization that Martin-Löf's original 1971 type theory was inconsistent as it allowed the same \"Type in Type\" behaviour that Girard's paradox exploits.","image":"874333eb7cb90abf34faf1358bca783439ec93a4.svg","url":"System_U"}
