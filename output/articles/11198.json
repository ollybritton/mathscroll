{"title":"Nontotient","summary":"In number theory, a nontotient is a positive integer n which is not a totient number: it is not in the range of  Euler's totient function φ, that is, the equation φ(x) = n has no solution x. In other words, n is a nontotient if there is no integer x that has exactly n coprimes below it. All odd numbers are nontotients, except 1, since it has the solutions x = 1 and x = 2. The first few even nontotients are","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Nontotient"}
