{"title":"Cubic honeycomb honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 4-space, the cubic honeycomb honeycomb is one of two paracompact regular space-filling tessellations (or honeycombs). It is called paracompact because it has infinite facets, whose vertices exist on 3-horospheres and converge to a single ideal point at infinity. With Schl√§fli symbol {4,3,4,3}, it has three cubic honeycombs around each face, and with a {3,4,3} vertex figure. It is dual to the order-4 24-cell honeycomb.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Cubic_honeycomb_honeycomb"}
