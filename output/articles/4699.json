{"title":"Eisenstein series","summary":"Eisenstein series, named after German mathematician Gotthold Eisenstein, are particular modular forms with infinite series expansions that may be written down directly. Originally defined for the modular group, Eisenstein series can be generalized in the theory of automorphic forms.","image":"Gee_three_real.jpeg.webp","url":"Eisenstein_series"}
