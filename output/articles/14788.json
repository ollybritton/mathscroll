{"title":"Spherical multipole moments","summary":"In physics, spherical multipole moments are the coefficients in a series expansion of a potential that varies inversely with the distance R to a source, i.e., as 1 R . {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{R}}.} Examples of such potentials are the electric potential, the magnetic potential and the gravitational potential.","image":"194c3cc9e15653c2b8d9f54df124db0c60dd77c9.svg","url":"Spherical_multipole_moments"}
