{"title":"Rigid category","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a rigid category is a monoidal category where every object is rigid, that is, has a dual X* (the internal Hom [X, 1]) and a morphism 1 → X ⊗ X* satisfying natural conditions. The category is called right rigid or left rigid according to whether it has right duals or left duals. They were first defined (following Alexandre Grothendieck) by Neantro Saavedra Rivano in his thesis on Tannakian categories.[1]","image":"75655260ee437ca6a21b71e34ac950cb0c395b4f.svg","url":"Rigid_category"}
