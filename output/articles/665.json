{"title":"Almost open map","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, an almost open map between topological spaces is a map that satisfies a condition similar to, but weaker than, the condition of being an open map. As described below, for certain broad categories of topological vector spaces, all surjective linear operators are necessarily almost open.","image":"43b6b077a3059ca728f62c163fec3d93b8429769.svg","url":"Almost_open_map"}
