{"title":"Quarter 8-cubic honeycomb","summary":"In seven-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the quarter 8-cubic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). It has half the vertices of the 8-demicubic honeycomb, and a quarter of the vertices of a 8-cube honeycomb.[1] Its facets are 8-demicubes h{4,36}, pentic 8-cubes h6{4,36}, {3,3}×{32,1,1} and {31,1,1}×{31,1,1} duoprisms.","image":"CDel_nodes_10ru.png.webp","url":"Quarter_8-cubic_honeycomb"}
