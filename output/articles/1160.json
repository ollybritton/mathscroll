{"title":"Automatic sequence","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical computer science, an automatic sequence (also called a k-automatic sequence or a k-recognizable sequence when one wants to indicate that the base of the numerals used is k) is an infinite sequence of terms characterized by a finite automaton.  The n-th term of an automatic sequence a(n) is a mapping of the final state reached in a finite automaton accepting the digits of the number n in some fixed baseÂ k.[1][2]","image":"6fe4d5b0a594c1da89b5e78e7dfbeed90bdcc32f.svg","url":"Automatic_sequence"}
