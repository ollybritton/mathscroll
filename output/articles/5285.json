{"title":"Faltings's theorem","summary":"Faltings's theorem is a result in arithmetic geometry, according to which a curve of genus greater than 1 over the field Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } of rational numbers has only finitely many rational points. This was conjectured in 1922 by Louis Mordell,[1] and known as the Mordell conjecture until its 1983 proof by Gerd Faltings.[2] The conjecture was later generalized by replacing Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } by any number field.","image":"c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a.svg","url":"Faltings's_theorem"}
