{"title":"Kalai's 3^d conjecture","summary":"In geometry, Kalai's 3d conjecture is a conjecture on the polyhedral combinatorics of centrally symmetric polytopes, made by Gil Kalai in 1989.[1] It states that every d-dimensional centrally symmetric polytope has at least 3d nonempty faces (including the polytope itself as a face but not including the empty set).","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Kalai's_3^d_conjecture"}
