{"title":"Order topology (functional analysis)","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, the order topology of an ordered vector space ( X , ≤ ) {\\displaystyle (X,\\leq )} is the finest locally convex topological vector space (TVS) topology on X {\\displaystyle X} for which every order interval is bounded, where an order interval in X {\\displaystyle X} is a set of the form [ a , b ] := { z ∈ X : a ≤ z and z ≤ b } {\\displaystyle [a,b]:=\\left\\{z\\in X:a\\leq z{\\text{ and }}z\\leq b\\right\\}} where a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} belong to X . {\\displaystyle X.} [1]","image":"05986ce35d21b64f59206cb040c9c1607dae82b8.svg","url":"Order_topology_(functional_analysis)"}
