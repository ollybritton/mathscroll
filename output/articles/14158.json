{"title":"Sentence (mathematical logic)","summary":"In mathematical logic, a sentence (or closed formula)[1] of a predicate logic is a Boolean-valued well-formed formula with no free variables. A sentence can be viewed as expressing a proposition, something that must be true or false.  The restriction of having no free variables is needed to make sure that sentences can have concrete, fixed truth values: as the free variables of a (general) formula can range over several values, the truth value of such a formula may vary.","image":"a76b744829defb4acdaa837a6439b00e6d9dc8e2.svg","url":"Sentence_(mathematical_logic)"}
