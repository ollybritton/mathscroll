{"title":"Quillen's theorems A and B","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, Quillen's Theorem A gives a sufficient condition for the classifying spaces of two categories to be homotopy equivalent. Quillen's Theorem B gives a sufficient condition for a square consisting of classifying spaces of categories to be homotopy Cartesian. The two theorems play central roles in Quillen's Q-construction in algebraic K-theory and are named after Daniel Quillen.","image":"f9af673473fce78b42b08129374eef6a040b35bb.svg","url":"Quillen's_theorems_A_and_B"}
