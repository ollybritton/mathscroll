{"title":"Léon Walras","summary":"Marie-Esprit-Léon Walras (French: [valʁas];[2] 16 December 1834 – 5 January 1910) was a French mathematical economist and Georgist.[3] He formulated the marginal theory of value (independently of William Stanley Jevons and Carl Menger) and pioneered the development of general equilibrium theory. Walras is best known for his book Éléments d'économie politique pure, a work that has contributed greatly to the mathematization of economics through the concept of general equilibrium. The definition of the role of the entrepreneur found in it was also taken up and amplified by Joseph Schumpeter.","image":"Walrass.jpg.webp","url":"Léon_Walras"}
