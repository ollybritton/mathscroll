{"title":"Limit of a sequence","summary":"In mathematics, the limit of a sequence is the value that the terms of a sequence \"tend to\", and is often denoted using the lim {\\displaystyle \\lim } symbol (e.g., lim n → ∞ a n {\\displaystyle \\lim _{n\\to \\infty }a_{n}} ).[1] If such a limit exists, the sequence is called convergent.[2] A sequence that does not converge is said to be divergent.[3] The limit of a sequence is said to be the fundamental notion on which the whole of mathematical analysis ultimately rests.[1]","image":"1f3492ce8a823c21000f46e64db14732db9a8cce.svg","url":"Limit_of_a_sequence"}
