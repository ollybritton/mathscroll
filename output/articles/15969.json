{"title":"Transgression map","summary":"In algebraic topology, a transgression map is a way to transfer cohomology classes. It occurs, for example in the inflation-restriction exact sequence in group cohomology, and in integration in fibers. It also naturally arises in many spectral sequences; see spectral sequence#Edge maps and transgressions.","image":"ab52bff253c690c4e0d473400ab8c365ea019298.svg","url":"Transgression_map"}
