{"title":"Equivariant cohomology","summary":"In mathematics, equivariant cohomology (or Borel cohomology) is a cohomology theory from algebraic topology which applies to topological spaces with a group action.  It can be viewed as a common generalization of group cohomology and an ordinary cohomology theory. Specifically, the equivariant cohomology ring of a space X {\\displaystyle X} with action of a topological group G {\\displaystyle G} is defined as the ordinary cohomology ring with coefficient ring Λ {\\displaystyle \\Lambda } of the homotopy quotient E G × G X {\\displaystyle EG\\times _{G}X} :","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Equivariant_cohomology"}
