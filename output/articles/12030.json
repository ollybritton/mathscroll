{"title":"Permutable prime","summary":"A permutable prime, also known as anagrammatic prime, is a prime number which, in a given base, can have its digits' positions switched through any permutation and still be a prime number. H. E. Richert, who is supposedly the first to study these primes, called them permutable primes,[1] but later they were also called absolute primes.[2]","image":"dcc633298696b5281a64ac433fad7b596c18dcf2.svg","url":"Permutable_prime"}
