{"title":"Euler summation","summary":"In the mathematics of convergent and divergent series, Euler summation is a summation method. That is, it is a method for assigning a value to a series, different from the conventional method of taking limits of partial sums. Given a series Î£an, if its Euler transform converges to a sum, then that sum is called the Euler sum of the original series. As well as being used to define values for divergent series, Euler summation can be used to speed the convergence of series.","image":"7820828f838b923b268834ae8781d0e824c2b712.svg","url":"Euler_summation"}
