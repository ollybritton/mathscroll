{"title":"Kronecker limit formula","summary":"In mathematics, the classical Kronecker limit formula describes the constant term at s = 1 of a real analytic Eisenstein series (or Epstein zeta function) in terms of the Dedekind eta function. There are many generalizations of it to more complicated Eisenstein series. It is named for Leopold Kronecker.","image":"dc720e5ddb9a72cdd02b877c4cce00e0b984ede9.svg","url":"Kronecker_limit_formula"}
