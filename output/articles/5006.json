{"title":"Essentially finite vector bundle","summary":"In mathematics, an essentially finite vector bundle is a particular type of vector bundle defined by Madhav V. Nori,[1][2] as the main tool in the construction of the fundamental group scheme.  Even if the definition is not intuitive there is a nice characterization that makes essentially finite vector bundles quite natural objects to study in algebraic geometry. The following notion of finite vector bundle is due to Andr√© Weil and will be needed to define essentially finite vector bundles:","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Essentially_finite_vector_bundle"}
