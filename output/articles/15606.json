{"title":"Tetragonal disphenoid honeycomb","summary":"The tetragonal disphenoid tetrahedral honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 3-space made up of identical tetragonal disphenoidal cells. Cells are face-transitive with 4 identical isosceles triangle faces. John Horton Conway calls it an oblate tetrahedrille or shortened to obtetrahedrille.[1]","image":"Quartercell_honeycomb.png.webp","url":"Tetragonal_disphenoid_honeycomb"}
