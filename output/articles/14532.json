{"title":"Small-world routing","summary":"In network theory, small-world routing refers to routing methods for small-world networks. Networks of this type are peculiar in that relatively short paths exist between any two nodes. Determining these paths, however, can be a difficult problem from the perspective of an individual routing node in the network if no further information is known about the network as a whole.","image":"e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597.svg","url":"Small-world_routing"}
