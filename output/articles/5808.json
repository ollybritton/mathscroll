{"title":"Full and faithful functors","summary":"In category theory, a faithful functor is a functor that is injective on hom-sets, and a full functor is surjective on hom-sets. A functor that has both properties is called a full and faithful functor.","image":"cb8801997c1284128ffadc7dc89901563840dd7d.svg","url":"Full_and_faithful_functors"}
