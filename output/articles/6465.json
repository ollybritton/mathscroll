{"title":"Graph edit distance","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, graph edit distance (GED) is a measure of similarity (or dissimilarity) between two graphs. The concept of graph edit distance was first formalized mathematically by Alberto Sanfeliu and King-Sun Fu in 1983.[1] A major application of graph edit distance is in inexact graph matching, such as error-tolerant pattern recognition in machine learning.[2]","image":"3755e3e04ec295992b2b5331655ef83a500a05c1.svg","url":"Graph_edit_distance"}
