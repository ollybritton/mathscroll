{"title":"Stratonovich integral","summary":"In stochastic processes, the Stratonovich integral (developed simultaneously by Ruslan Stratonovich and Donald Fisk) is a stochastic integral, the most common alternative to the Itô integral.  Although the Itô integral is the usual choice in applied mathematics, the Stratonovich integral is frequently used in physics.","image":"b2227fe6d949bb5ffca7a97320cfa6ba143b763e.svg","url":"Stratonovich_integral"}
