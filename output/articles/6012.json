{"title":"Gauss–Manin connection","summary":"In mathematics, the Gauss–Manin connection is a connection on a certain vector bundle over a base space S of a family of algebraic varieties V s {\\displaystyle V_{s}} . The fibers of the vector bundle are the de Rham cohomology groups H D R k ( V s ) {\\displaystyle H_{DR}^{k}(V_{s})} of the fibers V s {\\displaystyle V_{s}} of the family. It was introduced by Yuri Manin (1958) for curves S and by Alexander Grothendieck (1966) in higher dimensions.","image":"57d5d0bb9d326d015df44456d7c0648f80c0f1f5.svg","url":"Gauss–Manin_connection"}
