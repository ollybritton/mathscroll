{"title":"Noncommutative topology","summary":"In mathematics, noncommutative topology is a term used for the relationship between topological and C*-algebraic concepts. The term has its origins in the Gelfandâ€“Naimark theorem, which implies the duality of the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces and the category of commutative C*-algebras. Noncommutative topology is related to analytic noncommutative geometry.","image":"12d7767f3432b5f245c38f309be0ada6a826643b.svg","url":"Noncommutative_topology"}
