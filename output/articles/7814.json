{"title":"Injective function","summary":"In mathematics, an injective function (also known as injection, or one-to-one function) is a function f that maps distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements; that is, f(x1) = f(x2) implies x1 = x2. (Equivalently, x1 ≠ x2 implies f(x1) ≠ f(x2) in the equivalent contrapositive statement.) In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the image of at most one element of its domain.[1] The term one-to-one function must not be confused with one-to-one correspondence that refers to bijective functions, which are functions such that each element in the codomain is an image of exactly one element in the domain.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Injective_function"}
