{"title":"Nichols algebra","summary":"In algebra, the Nichols algebra of a braided vector space (with the braiding often induced by a finite group) is a braided Hopf algebra which is denoted by B ( V ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {B}}(V)} and named after the mathematician Warren Nichols. It takes the role of quantum Borel part of a pointed Hopf algebra[1] such as a quantum groups and their well known finite-dimensional truncations. Nichols algebras can immediately be used to write down new such quantum groups by using the Radford biproduct.[1]","image":"4a6ba1a1a3f533ce97394ad69d916dae5fa9025b.svg","url":"Nichols_algebra"}
