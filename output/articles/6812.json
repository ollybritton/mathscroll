{"title":"Half-transitive graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a half-transitive graph is a graph that is both vertex-transitive and edge-transitive, but not symmetric.[1]  In other words, a graph is half-transitive if its automorphism group acts transitively upon both its vertices and its edges, but not on ordered pairs of linked vertices.","image":"Holt_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Half-transitive_graph"}
