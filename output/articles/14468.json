{"title":"Siteswap","summary":"Siteswap, also called quantum juggling or the Cambridge notation, is a numeric juggling notation used to describe or represent juggling patterns. The term may also be used to describe siteswap patterns, possible patterns transcribed using siteswap. Throws are represented by non-negative integers that specify the number of beats in the future when the object is thrown again: \"The idea behind siteswap is to keep track of the order that balls are thrown and caught, and only that.\"[3] It is an invaluable tool in determining which combinations of throws yield valid juggling patterns for a given number of objects, and has led to previously unknown patterns (such as 441). However, it does not describe body movements such as behind-the-back and under-the-leg. Siteswap assumes that \"throws happen on beats that are equally spaced in time.\"[4]","image":"Siteswap_relative_visualized.png.webp","url":"Siteswap"}
