{"title":"Whitney topologies","summary":"In mathematics, and especially differential topology, functional analysis and singularity theory, the Whitney topologies are a countably infinite family of topologies defined on the set of smooth mappings between two smooth manifolds. They are named after the American mathematician Hassler Whitney.","image":"63f47d94780d12024eb4fa88dd4ab7d79572e089.svg","url":"Whitney_topologies"}
