{"title":"Courcelle's theorem","summary":"In the study of graph algorithms, Courcelle's theorem is the statement that every graph property definable in the monadic second-order logic of graphs can be decided in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth.[1][2][3] The result was first proved by Bruno Courcelle in 1990[4] and independently rediscovered by Borie, Parker & Tovey (1992).[5] It is considered the archetype of algorithmic meta-theorems.[6][7]","image":"8553f63a9b6be8890518034a7195e5e73c358822.svg","url":"Courcelle's_theorem"}
