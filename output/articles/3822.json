{"title":"De Bruijn notation","summary":"In mathematical logic, the De Bruijn notation is a syntax for terms in the λ calculus invented by the Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn.[1] It can be seen as a reversal of the usual syntax for the λ calculus where the argument in an application is placed next to its corresponding binder in the function instead of after the latter's body.","image":"3e544109c2d21912c0bf2cd04fb8a6ab1c1ceb27.svg","url":"De_Bruijn_notation"}
