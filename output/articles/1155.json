{"title":"Auslander–Reiten theory","summary":"In algebra, Auslander–Reiten theory studies the representation theory of Artinian rings using techniques such as Auslander–Reiten sequences (also called almost split sequences) and Auslander–Reiten quivers. Auslander–Reiten theory was introduced by Maurice Auslander and Idun Reiten (1975) and developed by them in several subsequent papers.","image":"c37f1db38927b14823355faf387e9ee1232a65cc.svg","url":"Auslander–Reiten_theory"}
