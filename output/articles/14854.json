{"title":"Square knot (mathematics)","summary":"In knot theory, the square knot is a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of a trefoil knot with its reflection.  It is closely related to the granny knot, which is also a connected sum of two trefoils.  Because the trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot, the square knot and the granny knot are the simplest of all composite knots.","image":"Blue_Square_Knot.png.webp","url":"Square_knot_(mathematics)"}
