{"title":"Shinichi Mochizuki","summary":"Shinichi Mochizuki (望月 新一, Mochizuki Shin'ichi, born March 29, 1969) is a Japanese mathematician working in number theory and arithmetic geometry. He is one of the main contributors to anabelian geometry. His contributions include his solution of the Grothendieck conjecture in anabelian geometry about hyperbolic curves over number fields. Mochizuki has also worked in Hodge–Arakelov theory and p-adic Teichmüller theory. Mochizuki developed inter-universal Teichmüller theory,[2][3][4][5] which has attracted attention from non-mathematicians due to claims it provides a resolution of the abc conjecture.[6]","image":"Wikiquote-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Shinichi_Mochizuki"}
