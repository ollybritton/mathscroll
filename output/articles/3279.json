{"title":"Constraint (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a constraint is a condition of an optimization problem that the solution must satisfy. There are several types of constraintsâ€”primarily equality constraints, inequality constraints, and integer constraints. The set of candidate solutions that satisfy all constraints is called the feasible set.[1]","image":"abf2aa7b3052af741fae0e359e5144695956b6c2.svg","url":"Constraint_(mathematics)"}
