{"title":"Dixmier trace","summary":"In mathematics, the Dixmier trace, introduced by Jacques DixmierÂ (1966), is a non-normal trace on a space of linear operators on a Hilbert space larger than the space of trace class operators.  Dixmier traces are examples of singular traces.","image":"835039ab8e45ac72eb0d9290570672e6e8d33511.svg","url":"Dixmier_trace"}
