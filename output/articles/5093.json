{"title":"Euler–Lotka equation","summary":"In the study of age-structured population growth, probably one of the most important equations is the Euler–Lotka equation. Based on the age demographic of females in the population and female births (since in many cases it is the females that are more limited in the ability to reproduce), this equation allows for an estimation of how a population is growing.","image":"83e9c2d3e1128349e276fded8fb8afaefdf31a0d.svg","url":"Euler–Lotka_equation"}
