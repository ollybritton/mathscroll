{"title":"Hilbert transform","summary":"In mathematics and signal processing, the Hilbert transform  is a specific singular integral that takes a function, u(t) of a real variable and produces another function of a real variable H(u)(t). The Hilbert transform is given by the Cauchy principal value of the convolution with the function 1 / ( π t ) {\\displaystyle 1/(\\pi t)} (see § Definition).  The Hilbert transform has a particularly simple representation in the frequency domain: It imparts a phase shift of ±90° (.mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}π⁄2 radians) to every frequency component of a function, the sign of the shift depending on the sign of the frequency  (see § Relationship with the Fourier transform).  The Hilbert transform is important in signal processing, where it is a component of the analytic representation of a real-valued signal u(t).  The Hilbert transform was first introduced by David Hilbert in this setting, to solve a special case of the Riemann–Hilbert problem for analytic functions.","image":"5346b721e36c4a1e6d237e4020e71845e3ae70e2.svg","url":"Hilbert_transform"}
