{"title":"Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process","summary":"In mathematics, the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is a stochastic process with applications in financial mathematics and the physical sciences. Its original application in physics was as a model for the velocity of a massive Brownian particle under the influence of friction. It is named after Leonard Ornstein and George Eugene Uhlenbeck.","image":"Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-5traces.svg.png.webp","url":"Ornstein–Uhlenbeck_process"}
