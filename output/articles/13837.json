{"title":"SKI combinator calculus","summary":"The SKI combinator calculus is a combinatory logic system and a computational system. It can be thought of as a computer programming language, though it is not convenient for writing software. Instead, it is important in the mathematical theory of algorithms because it is an extremely simple Turing complete language. It can be likened to a reduced version of the untyped lambda calculus. It was introduced by Moses Sch√∂nfinkel[1] and Haskell Curry.[2]","image":"3b8619532e44ee1ccae3ab03405a6885260d09ed.svg","url":"SKI_combinator_calculus"}
