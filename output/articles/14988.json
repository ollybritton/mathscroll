{"title":"Stein manifold","summary":"In mathematics, in the theory of several complex variables and complex manifolds, a Stein manifold is a complex submanifold of the vector space of n complex dimensions. They were introduced by and named after Karl SteinÂ (1951). A Stein space is similar to a Stein manifold but is allowed to have singularities. Stein spaces are the analogues of affine varieties or affine schemes in algebraic geometry.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Stein_manifold"}
