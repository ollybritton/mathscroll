{"title":"Regular embedding","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a closed immersion i : X ↪ Y {\\displaystyle i:X\\hookrightarrow Y} of schemes is a regular embedding of codimension r if each point x in X has an open affine neighborhood U in Y such that the ideal of X ∩ U {\\displaystyle X\\cap U} is generated by a regular sequence of length r. A regular embedding of codimension one is precisely an effective Cartier divisor.","image":"29f3f0662c620237a4fae4347bc9e48f13e34e47.svg","url":"Regular_embedding"}
