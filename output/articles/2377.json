{"title":"Cauchy–Euler equation","summary":"In mathematics, an Euler–Cauchy equation, or Cauchy–Euler equation, or simply Euler's equation is a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with variable coefficients. It is sometimes referred to as an equidimensional equation. Because of its particularly simple equidimensional structure, the differential equation can be solved explicitly.","image":"2cf7c1f774d19d1dfb26d046ad037b3f773b438d.svg","url":"Cauchy–Euler_equation"}
