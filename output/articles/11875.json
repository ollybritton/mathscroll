{"title":"Path graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a path graph (or linear graph) is a graph whose vertices can be listed in the order v1, v2, …, vn such that the edges are {vi, vi+1}  where i = 1, 2, …, n − 1.  Equivalently, a path with at least two vertices is connected and has two terminal vertices (vertices that have degree 1), while all others (if any) have degree 2.","image":"Path-graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Path_graph"}
