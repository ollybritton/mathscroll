{"title":"Rosser's trick","summary":"In mathematical logic, Rosser's trick is a method for proving Gödel's incompleteness theorems without the assumption that the theory being considered is ω-consistent (Smorynski 1977, p. 840; Mendelson 1977, p. 160). This method was introduced by  J. Barkley Rosser in 1936, as an improvement of Gödel's original proof of the incompleteness theorems that was published in 1931.","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Rosser's_trick"}
