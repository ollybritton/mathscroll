{"title":"Hyperplane","summary":"In geometry, a hyperplane is a subspace whose dimension is one less than that of its ambient space.  For example, if a space is 3-dimensional then its hyperplanes are the 2-dimensional planes, while if the space is 2-dimensional, its hyperplanes are the 1-dimensional lines.  This notion can be used in any general space in which the concept of the dimension of a subspace is defined.","image":"Intersecting_planes.svg.png.webp","url":"Hyperplane"}
