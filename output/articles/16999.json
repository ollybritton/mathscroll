{"title":"Wirtinger presentation","summary":"In mathematics, especially in group theory, a Wirtinger presentation is a finite presentation where the relations are of the form w g i w − 1 = g j {\\displaystyle wg_{i}w^{-1}=g_{j}} where w {\\displaystyle w} is a word in the generators, { g 1 , g 2 , … , g k } . {\\displaystyle \\{g_{1},g_{2},\\ldots ,g_{k}\\}.} Wilhelm Wirtinger observed that the complements of knots in 3-space have fundamental groups with presentations of this form.","image":"8ed249569b91ebe3a0230b5c21e0c7c77b47636c.svg","url":"Wirtinger_presentation"}
