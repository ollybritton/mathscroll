{"title":"Second fundamental form","summary":"In differential geometry, the second fundamental form (or shape tensor) is a quadratic form on the tangent plane of a smooth surface in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, usually denoted by I I {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {I\\!I} } (read \"two\"). Together with the first fundamental form, it serves to define extrinsic invariants of the surface, its principal curvatures. More generally, such a quadratic form is defined for a smooth immersed submanifold in a Riemannian manifold.","image":"bcc5b91d573a599cc0b6426ff90ea80310f39b1e.svg","url":"Second_fundamental_form"}
