{"title":"Jordanus de Nemore","summary":"Jordanus de Nemore (fl. 13th century), also known as Jordanus Nemorarius and Giordano of Nemi, was a thirteenth-century European mathematician and scientist. The literal translation of Jordanus de Nemore (Giordano of Nemi) would indicate that he was an Italian.[1] He wrote treatises on at least 6 different important mathematical subjects: the science of weights; “algorismi” treatises on practical arithmetic; pure arithmetic; algebra; geometry; and stereographic projection. Most of these treatises exist in several versions or reworkings from the Middle Ages. We know nothing about him personally, other than the approximate date of his work.","image":"Jordanus_-_Sphaerae_atque_astrorum_coelestium_ratio%2C_natura%2C_et_motus%2C_1536_-_105369.jpg.webp","url":"Jordanus_de_Nemore"}
