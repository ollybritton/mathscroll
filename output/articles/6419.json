{"title":"Gradient descent","summary":"In mathematics, gradient descent (also often called steepest descent) is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent. It is particularly useful in machine learning for minimizing the cost or loss function.[1] Despite its simplicity and efficiency, gradient descent has some limitations and variations have been developed to overcome these limitations. Overall, gradient descent has revolutionized various fields and continues to be an active area of research and development.","image":"Kernel_Machine.svg.png.webp","url":"Gradient_descent"}
