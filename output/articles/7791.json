{"title":"Information bottleneck method","summary":"The information bottleneck method is a technique in information theory introduced by Naftali Tishby, Fernando C. Pereira, and William Bialek.[1] It is designed for finding the best tradeoff between accuracy and complexity (compression) when summarizing (e.g. clustering) a random variable X, given a joint probability distribution p(X,Y) between X and an observed relevant variable Y - and self-described as providing \"a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning\".[1]","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Information_bottleneck_method"}
