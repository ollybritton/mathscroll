{"title":"Motzkin number","summary":"In mathematics, the nth Motzkin number is the number of different ways of drawing non-intersecting chords  between n points on a circle (not necessarily touching every point by a chord). The Motzkin numbers are named after Theodore Motzkin and have diverse applications in geometry, combinatorics and number theory.","image":"8656f32ad5c50e679b491b361a423727491496a0.svg","url":"Motzkin_number"}
