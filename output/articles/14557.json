{"title":"Small retrosnub icosicosidodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the small retrosnub icosicosidodecahedron (also known as a retrosnub disicosidodecahedron, small inverted retrosnub icosicosidodecahedron, or retroholosnub icosahedron) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U72. It has 112 faces (100 triangles and 12 pentagrams), 180 edges, and 60 vertices.[1] It is given a Schläfli symbol sr{⁵/₃,³/₂}.","image":"Small_retrosnub_icosicosidodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Small_retrosnub_icosicosidodecahedron"}
