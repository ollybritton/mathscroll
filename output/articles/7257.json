{"title":"Hilbert–Huang transform","summary":"The Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) is a way to decompose a signal into so-called intrinsic mode functions (IMF) along with a trend, and obtain instantaneous frequency data.  It is designed to work well for data that is nonstationary and nonlinear.  In contrast to other common transforms like the Fourier transform, the HHT is an algorithm that can be applied to a data set, rather than a theoretical tool.","image":"Emd_example_lowres.gif","url":"Hilbert–Huang_transform"}
