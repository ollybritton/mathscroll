{"title":"Haefliger structure","summary":"In mathematics, a Haefliger structure on a topological space is a generalization of a foliation of a manifold, introduced by Andr√© Haefliger in 1970.[1][2] Any foliation on a manifold induces a special kind of Haefliger structure, which uniquely determines the foliation.","image":"06809d64fa7c817ffc7e323f85997f783dbdf71d.svg","url":"Haefliger_structure"}
