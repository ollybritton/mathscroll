{"title":"Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions","summary":"Erdős' conjecture on arithmetic progressions, often referred to as the Erdős–Turán conjecture, is a conjecture in arithmetic combinatorics (not to be confused with the Erdős–Turán conjecture on additive bases). It states that if the sum of the reciprocals of the members of a set A of positive integers diverges, then A contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.","image":"52360b8efb4ad5cf83389074d514592437554b1e.svg","url":"Erdős_conjecture_on_arithmetic_progressions"}
