{"title":"Cycle double cover","summary":"In graph-theoretic mathematics, a cycle double cover is a collection of cycles in an undirected graph that together include each edge of the graph exactly twice. For instance, for any polyhedral graph, the faces of a convex polyhedron that represents the graph provide a double cover of the graph: each edge belongs to exactly two faces.","image":"Petersen_double_cover.svg.png.webp","url":"Cycle_double_cover"}
