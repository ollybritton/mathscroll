{"title":"Differential ideal","summary":"In the theory of differential forms, a differential ideal I is an algebraic ideal in the ring of smooth differential forms on a smooth manifold, in other words a graded ideal in the sense of ring theory, that is further closed under exterior differentiation d, meaning that for any form α in I, the exterior derivative dα is also in I.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Differential_ideal"}
