{"title":"Similarity invariance","summary":"In linear algebra, similarity invariance is a property exhibited by a function whose value is unchanged under similarities of its domain.  That is, f {\\displaystyle f} is invariant under similarities if f ( A ) = f ( B − 1 A B ) {\\displaystyle f(A)=f(B^{-1}AB)} where B − 1 A B {\\displaystyle B^{-1}AB} is a matrix similar to A.  Examples of such functions include the trace, determinant, characteristic polynomial, and the minimal polynomial.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Similarity_invariance"}
