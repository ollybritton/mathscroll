{"title":"Cycle decomposition (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, a cycle decomposition is a decomposition (a partitioning of a graph's edges) into cycles. Every vertex in a graph that has a cycle decomposition must have even degree.","image":"ea2b988ea630d2c5571afe47efa3d3b251708acb.svg","url":"Cycle_decomposition_(graph_theory)"}
