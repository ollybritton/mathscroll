{"title":"Lewy's example","summary":"In the mathematical study of partial differential equations, Lewy's example is a celebrated example, due to Hans Lewy, of a linear partial differential equation with no solutions. It shows that the analog of the Cauchyâ€“Kovalevskaya theorem does not hold in the smooth category.","image":"f69901fe108042d937c547aa378b8b55a6c5fcb3.svg","url":"Lewy's_example"}
