{"title":"Dickson polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, the Dickson polynomials, denoted Dn(x,α), form a polynomial sequence introduced by L. E. Dickson (1897). They were  rediscovered by Brewer (1961) in his study of Brewer sums and have at times, although rarely, been referred to as Brewer polynomials.","image":"8fdb9e5692a9da9279ec776754c7023aa91737b6.svg","url":"Dickson_polynomial"}
