{"title":"Gauge theory (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, and especially differential geometry and mathematical physics, gauge theory is the general study of connections on vector bundles, principal bundles, and fibre bundles. Gauge theory in mathematics should not be confused with the closely related concept of a gauge theory in physics, which is a field theory which admits gauge symmetry. In mathematics theory means a mathematical theory, encapsulating the general study of a collection of concepts or phenomena, whereas in the physical sense a gauge theory is a mathematical model of some natural phenomenon.","image":"-y-(x^2%2By^2%2B1)_plot%3B_BPST_instanton.png.webp","url":"Gauge_theory_(mathematics)"}
