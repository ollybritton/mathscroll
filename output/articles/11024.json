{"title":"Neural network Gaussian process","summary":"Bayesian networks are a modeling tool for assigning probabilities to events, and thereby characterizing the uncertainty in a model's predictions. Deep learning and artificial neural networks are approaches used in machine learning to build computational models which learn from training examples. Bayesian neural networks merge these fields. They are a type of artificial neural network whose parameters and predictions are both probabilistic.[1][2] While standard artificial neural networks often assign high confidence even to incorrect predictions,[3] Bayesian neural networks can more accurately evaluate how likely their predictions are to be correct.","image":"e4f050945a3f09325c2d582048d8343119364a8c.svg","url":"Neural_network_Gaussian_process"}
