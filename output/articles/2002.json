{"title":"Brouwer–Haemers graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Brouwer–Haemers graph is a 20-regular undirected graph with 81 vertices and 810 edges. It is a strongly regular graph, a distance-transitive graph, and a Ramanujan graph. Although its construction is folklore, it was named after Andries Brouwer and Willem H. Haemers, who proved its uniqueness as a strongly regular graph.","image":"Brouwer_Haemers_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Brouwer–Haemers_graph"}
