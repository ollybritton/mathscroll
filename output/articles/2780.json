{"title":"Closed immersion","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a closed immersion of schemes is a morphism of schemes f : Z → X {\\displaystyle f:Z\\to X} that identifies Z as a closed subset of X such that locally, regular functions on Z can be extended to X.[1] The latter condition can be formalized by saying that f # : O X → f ∗ O Z {\\displaystyle f^{\\#}:{\\mathcal {O}}_{X}\\rightarrow f_{\\ast }{\\mathcal {O}}_{Z}} is surjective.[2]","image":"885cea5646c4e9fd18d0cfd83e0160ba458a9e4c.svg","url":"Closed_immersion"}
