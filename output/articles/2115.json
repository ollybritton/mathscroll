{"title":"CORDIC","summary":"CORDIC (for \"coordinate rotation digital computer\"), also known as Volder's algorithm, or: Digit-by-digit method Circular CORDIC (Jack E. Volder),[1][2] Linear CORDIC, Hyperbolic CORDIC (John Stephen Walther),[3][4] and Generalized Hyperbolic CORDIC (GH CORDIC) (Yuanyong Luo et al.),[5][6] is a simple and efficient algorithm to calculate trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, square roots, multiplications, divisions, and exponentials and logarithms with arbitrary base, typically converging with one digit (or bit) per iteration.  CORDIC is therefore also an example of digit-by-digit algorithms. CORDIC and closely related methods known as pseudo-multiplication and pseudo-division or factor combining are commonly used when no hardware multiplier is available (e.g. in simple microcontrollers and FPGAs), as the only operations it requires are additions, subtractions, bitshift and lookup tables. As such, they all belong to the class of shift-and-add algorithms. In computer science, CORDIC is often used to implement floating-point arithmetic when the target platform lacks hardware multiply for cost or space reasons.","image":"Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_1.svg.png.webp","url":"CORDIC"}
