{"title":"List of k-uniform tilings","summary":"A k-uniform tiling is a tiling of tilings of the plane by convex regular polygons, connected edge-to-edge, with k types of vertices. The 1-uniform tiling include 3 regular tilings, and 8 semiregular tilings. A 1-uniform tiling can be defined by its vertex configuration. Higher k-uniform tilings are listed by their vertex figures, but are not generally uniquely identified this way.","image":"1-uniform_n1.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_k-uniform_tilings"}
