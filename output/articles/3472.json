{"title":"Cotangent space","summary":"In differential geometry, the cotangent space is a vector space associated with a point x {\\displaystyle x} on a smooth (or differentiable) manifold M {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}} ; one can define a cotangent space for every point on a smooth manifold. Typically, the cotangent space, T x âˆ— M {\\displaystyle T_{x}^{*}\\!{\\mathcal {M}}} is defined as the dual space of the tangent space at x {\\displaystyle x} , T x M {\\displaystyle T_{x}{\\mathcal {M}}} , although there are more direct definitions (see below). The elements of the cotangent space are called cotangent vectors or tangent covectors.","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Cotangent_space"}
