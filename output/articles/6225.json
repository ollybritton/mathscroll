{"title":"German tank problem","summary":"In the statistical theory of estimation, the German tank problem consists of estimating the maximum of a discrete uniform distribution from sampling without replacement. In simple terms, suppose there exists an unknown number of items which are sequentially numbered from 1 to N. A random sample of these items is taken and their sequence numbers observed; the problem is to estimate N from these observed numbers.","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-635-3966-27%2C_Panzerfabrik_in_Deutschland.jpg.webp","url":"German_tank_problem"}
