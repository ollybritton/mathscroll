{"title":"Reed–Muller code","summary":"Reed–Muller codes are error-correcting codes that are used in wireless communications applications, particularly in deep-space communication.[1] Moreover, the proposed 5G standard[2] relies on the closely related polar codes[3] for error correction in the control channel. Due to their favorable theoretical and mathematical properties, Reed–Muller codes have also been extensively studied in theoretical computer science.","image":"667d0154f26e56e3f7979803f08afac16b4dcb16.svg","url":"Reed–Muller_code"}
