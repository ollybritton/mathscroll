{"title":"Eilenberg–Zilber theorem","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in algebraic topology, the Eilenberg–Zilber theorem is an important result in establishing the link between the homology groups of a product space X × Y {\\displaystyle X\\times Y} and those of the spaces X {\\displaystyle X} and Y {\\displaystyle Y} . The theorem first appeared in a 1953 paper in the American Journal of Mathematics by Samuel Eilenberg and Joseph A. Zilber.  One possible route to a proof is the acyclic model theorem.","image":"1613c1ff4b6fbfb6c80a8da83e90ad28f0ab3483.svg","url":"Eilenberg–Zilber_theorem"}
