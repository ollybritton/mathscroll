{"title":"Laver's theorem","summary":"Laver's theorem, in order theory, states that order embeddability of countable total orders is a well-quasi-ordering. That is, for every infinite sequence of totally-ordered countable sets, there exists an order embedding from an earlier member of the sequence to a later member. This result was previously known as Fraïssé's conjecture, after Roland Fraïssé, who conjectured it in 1948;[1] Richard Laver proved the conjecture in 1971. More generally, Laver proved the same result for order embeddings of countable unions of scattered orders.[2][3]","image":"0fd076fb78a7a5ee340920a3d846ddf67455f941.svg","url":"Laver's_theorem"}
