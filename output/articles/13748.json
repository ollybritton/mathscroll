{"title":"Routh's theorem","summary":"In geometry, Routh's theorem determines the ratio of areas between a given triangle and a triangle formed by the pairwise intersections of three cevians.  The theorem states that if in triangle A B C {\\displaystyle ABC} points D {\\displaystyle D} , E {\\displaystyle E} , and F {\\displaystyle F} lie on segments B C {\\displaystyle BC} , C A {\\displaystyle CA} , and A B {\\displaystyle AB} , then writing C D B D = x {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {CD}{BD}}=x} , A E C E = y {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {AE}{CE}}=y} , and B F A F = z {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {BF}{AF}}=z} , the signed area of the triangle formed by the cevians A D {\\displaystyle AD} , B E {\\displaystyle BE} , and C F {\\displaystyle CF} is","image":"5e55b44cfd965fbdc7a328d5db8a35a619db0971.svg","url":"Routh's_theorem"}
