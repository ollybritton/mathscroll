{"title":"Cauchy's convergence test","summary":"The Cauchy convergence test is a method used to test infinite series for convergence. It relies on bounding sums of terms in the series. This convergence criterion is named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy who published it in his textbook Cours d'Analyse 1821.[1]","image":"d65e1aca360e85e162e9a03819e5d5af5592e8d0.svg","url":"Cauchy's_convergence_test"}
