{"title":"Collapsing manifold","summary":"In Riemannian geometry, a collapsing or collapsed manifold is an n-dimensional manifold M that admits a sequence of Riemannian metrics gi, such that as i goes to infinity the manifold is close to a k-dimensional space, where k < n, in the Gromov–Hausdorff distance sense. Generally there are some restrictions  on the sectional curvatures of (M, gi).  The simplest example is a flat manifold, whose metric can be rescaled by 1/i, so that the manifold is close to a point, but its curvature remains 0 for all i.","image":"4bbecf9c93456f6fb0a956e1a8c0a8bc0575b65b.svg","url":"Collapsing_manifold"}
