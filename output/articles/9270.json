{"title":"Lie conformal algebra","summary":"A Lie conformal algebra is in some sense a generalization of a Lie algebra in that it too is a \"Lie algebra,\" though in a different pseudo-tensor category. Lie conformal algebras are very closely related to vertex algebras and have many applications in other areas of algebra and integrable systems.","image":"103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8.svg","url":"Lie_conformal_algebra"}
