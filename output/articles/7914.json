{"title":"Internal set theory","summary":"Internal set theory (IST) is a mathematical theory of sets developed by Edward Nelson that provides an axiomatic basis for a portion of the nonstandard analysis introduced by Abraham Robinson. Instead of adding new elements to the real numbers, Nelson's approach modifies the axiomatic foundations through syntactic enrichment.  Thus, the axioms introduce a new term, \"standard\", which can be used to make discriminations not possible under the conventional  ZFC axioms for sets.  Thus, IST is an enrichment of ZFC: all axioms of ZFC are satisfied for all classical predicates, while the new unary predicate \"standard\" satisfies three additional axioms I, S, and T.  In particular, suitable nonstandard elements within the set of real numbers can be shown to have properties that correspond to the properties of infinitesimal and unlimited elements.","image":"0e625658cf9111318b21c69344cb018e5d232bd2.svg","url":"Internal_set_theory"}
