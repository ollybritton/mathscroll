{"title":"Simple space","summary":"In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, a simple space is a connected topological space that has a homotopy type of a CW complex and whose fundamental group is abelian and acts trivially on the homotopy and homology of the universal covering space. Though not all authors include the assumption on the homotopy type.","image":"2aa5cc0602bbce5d12b4b2b6e1444efe75ae51e9.svg","url":"Simple_space"}
