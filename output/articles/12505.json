{"title":"Primitive recursive function","summary":"In computability theory, a primitive recursive function is, roughly speaking, a function that can be computed by a computer program whose loops are all \"for\" loops (that is, an upper bound of the number of iterations of every loop can be determined before entering the loop). Primitive recursive functions form a strict subset of those general recursive functions that are also total functions.","image":"c37184786012801a8d6a2123ad2e2af0bd9f5e54.svg","url":"Primitive_recursive_function"}
