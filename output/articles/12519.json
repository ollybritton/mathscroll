{"title":"Principal homogeneous space","summary":"In mathematics, a principal homogeneous space,[1] or torsor, for a group G is a homogeneous space X for G in which the stabilizer subgroup of every point is trivial. Equivalently, a principal homogeneous space for a group G is a non-empty set X on which G acts freely and transitively (meaning that, for any x, y in X, there exists a unique g in G such that x·g = y, where · denotes the (right) action of G on X). An analogous definition holds in other categories, where, for example,","image":"7d421bfce3a049d99055fbb788ecef6a132f0ff6.svg","url":"Principal_homogeneous_space"}
