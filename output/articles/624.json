{"title":"Algorithm","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (listen)) is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.[1] Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning), achieving automation eventually. Using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by Alan Turing with terms such as \"memory\", \"search\" and \"stimulus\".[2]","image":"Euclid_flowchart.svg.png.webp","url":"Algorithm"}
