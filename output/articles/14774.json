{"title":"Sphere theorem","summary":"In Riemannian geometry, the sphere theorem, also known as the quarter-pinched sphere theorem, strongly restricts the topology of manifolds admitting metrics with a particular curvature bound.  The precise statement of the theorem is as follows.  If M is a complete, simply-connected, n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature taking values in the interval ( 1 , 4 ] {\\displaystyle (1,4]} then M is homeomorphic to the n-sphere.  (To be precise, we mean the sectional curvature of every tangent 2-plane at each point must lie in ( 1 , 4 ] {\\displaystyle (1,4]} .)  Another way of stating the result is that if M is not homeomorphic to the sphere, then it is impossible to put a metric on M with quarter-pinched curvature.","image":"5874b482e7e0a5777f6837be39bbe60f8d3ff80c.svg","url":"Sphere_theorem"}
