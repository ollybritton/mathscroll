{"title":"Duflo isomorphism","summary":"In mathematics, the Duflo isomorphism is an isomorphism between the center of the universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra and the invariants of its symmetric algebra. It was introduced by Michel DufloÂ (1977) and  later generalized to arbitrary finite-dimensional Lie algebras by Kontsevich.","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Duflo_isomorphism"}
