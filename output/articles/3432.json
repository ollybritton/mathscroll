{"title":"Cop-win graph","summary":"In graph theory, a cop-win graph is an undirected graph on which the pursuer (cop) can always win a pursuitâ€“evasion game against a robber, with the players taking alternating turns in which they can choose to move along an edge of a graph or stay put, until the cop lands on the robber's vertex.[1] Finite cop-win graphs are also called dismantlable graphs or constructible graphs, because they can be dismantled by repeatedly removing a dominated vertex (one whose closed neighborhood is a subset of another vertex's neighborhood) or constructed by repeatedly adding such a vertex. The cop-win graphs can be recognized in polynomial time by a greedy algorithm that constructs a dismantling order. They include the chordal graphs, and the graphs that contain a universal vertex.","image":"Dominated_vertex.svg.png.webp","url":"Cop-win_graph"}
