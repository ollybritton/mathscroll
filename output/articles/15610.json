{"title":"Tetrahedral-icosahedral honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the tetrahedral-icosahedral honeycomb is a compact uniform honeycomb, constructed from icosahedron, tetrahedron, and octahedron cells, in an icosidodecahedron vertex figure. It has a single-ring Coxeter diagram , and is named by its two regular cells.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Tetrahedral-icosahedral_honeycomb"}
