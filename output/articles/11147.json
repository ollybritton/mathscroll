{"title":"Non-measurable set","summary":"In mathematics, a non-measurable set is a set which cannot be assigned a meaningful \"volume\".  The mathematical existence of such sets is construed to provide information about the notions of length, area and volume in formal set theory. In Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory, the axiom of choice entails that non-measurable subsets of R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } exist.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Non-measurable_set"}
