{"title":"Fredholm determinant","summary":"In mathematics, the Fredholm determinant is a complex-valued function which generalizes the determinant of a finite dimensional linear operator. It is defined for bounded operators on a Hilbert space which differ from the identity operator by a trace-class operator. The function is named after the mathematician Erik Ivar Fredholm.","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Fredholm_determinant"}
