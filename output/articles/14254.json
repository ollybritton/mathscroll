{"title":"Shape optimization","summary":"Shape optimization is part of the field of optimal control theory. The typical problem is to find the shape which is optimal in that it minimizes a certain cost functional while satisfying given constraints. In many cases, the functional being solved depends on the solution of a given partial differential equation defined on the variable domain.","image":"24b0d5ca6f381068d756f6337c08e0af9d1eeb6f.svg","url":"Shape_optimization"}
