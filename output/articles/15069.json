{"title":"Stirling's approximation","summary":"In mathematics, Stirling's approximation (or Stirling's formula) is an approximation for factorials. It is a good approximation, leading to accurate results even for small values of n {\\displaystyle n} . It is named after James Stirling, though a related but less precise result was first stated by Abraham de Moivre.[1][2][3]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Stirling's_approximation"}
