{"title":"Principal value","summary":"In mathematics, specifically complex analysis, the principal values of a multivalued function are the values along one chosen branch of that function, so that it is single-valued. A simple case arises in taking the square root of a positive real number. For example, 4 has two square roots: 2 and âˆ’2; of these the positive root, 2, is considered the principal root and is denoted as 4 . {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {4}}.}","image":"eb11134461da5a52d61da2b3463b3e05d8140d1a.svg","url":"Principal_value"}
