{"title":"Augmented Lagrangian method","summary":"Augmented Lagrangian methods are a certain class of algorithms for solving constrained optimization problems.  They have similarities to penalty methods in that they replace a constrained optimization problem by a series of unconstrained problems and add a penalty term to the objective; the difference is that the augmented Lagrangian method adds yet another term, designed to mimic a Lagrange multiplier.  The augmented Lagrangian is related to, but not identical with the method of Lagrange multipliers.","image":"1c1d24c2173bbb952e38a7dd7940634963794ad9.svg","url":"Augmented_Lagrangian_method"}
