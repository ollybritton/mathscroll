{"title":"n-ary group","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular universal algebra, the concept of an n-ary group (also called n-group or multiary group) is a generalization of the concept of a group to a set G with an n-ary operation instead of a binary operation.[1]   By an n-ary operation is meant any map f: Gn → G from the n-th Cartesian power of G to G.  The axioms for an n-ary group are defined in such a way that they reduce to those of a group in the case n = 2.  The earliest work on these structures was done in 1904 by Kasner and in 1928 by Dörnte;[2] the first systematic account of (what were then called) polyadic groups was given in 1940 by Emil Leon Post in a famous 143-page paper in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society.[3]","image":"b487b69eb278d981510d074eff455a2e5ff0dbd7.svg","url":"N-ary_group"}
