{"title":"Mumford–Shah functional","summary":"The Mumford–Shah functional is a functional that is used to establish an optimality criterion for segmenting an image into sub-regions. An image is modeled as a piecewise-smooth function. The functional penalizes the distance between the model and the input image, the lack of smoothness of the model within the sub-regions, and the length of the boundaries of the sub-regions. By minimizing the functional one may compute the best image segmentation. The functional was proposed by mathematicians David Mumford and Jayant Shah in 1989.[1]","image":"64ae981b6dd1aae26d3d090561295686e26e9eca.svg","url":"Mumford–Shah_functional"}
