{"title":"Riesz potential","summary":"In mathematics, the Riesz potential is a potential named after its discoverer, the Hungarian mathematician Marcel Riesz.  In a sense, the Riesz potential defines an inverse for a power of the Laplace operator on Euclidean space.  They generalize to several variables the Riemannâ€“Liouville integrals of one variable.","image":"6c6351db0756b099e0845350112ae72c69fec90c.svg","url":"Riesz_potential"}
