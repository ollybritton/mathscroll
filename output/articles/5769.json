{"title":"Frobenius manifold","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a Frobenius manifold, introduced by Dubrovin,[1] is a flat Riemannian manifold with a certain compatible multiplicative structure on the tangent space.  The concept generalizes the notion of Frobenius algebra to tangent bundles.","image":"1f8387e8f587e2d7d3b65b3704db9786a6f3dff5.svg","url":"Frobenius_manifold"}
