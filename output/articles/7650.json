{"title":"Ihara zeta function","summary":"In mathematics, the Ihara zeta function is a zeta function associated with a finite graph. It closely resembles the Selberg zeta function, and is used to relate closed walks to the spectrum of the adjacency matrix. The Ihara zeta function was first defined by Yasutaka Ihara in the 1960s in the context of discrete subgroups of the two-by-two p-adic special linear group. Jean-Pierre Serre suggested in his book Trees that Ihara's original definition can be reinterpreted graph-theoretically. It was Toshikazu Sunada who put this suggestion into practice in 1985. As observed by Sunada, a regular graph is a Ramanujan graph if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis.[1]","image":"4e56643be76a60f58e1498a9b5fbf226fd2cd825.svg","url":"Ihara_zeta_function"}
