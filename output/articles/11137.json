{"title":"Nomogram","summary":"A nomogram (from Greek nomos νόμος, \"law\" and grammē γραμμή, \"line\"), also called a nomograph, alignment chart, or abac, is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a mathematical function. The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne (1862–1938) and used extensively for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. Nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard Cartesian coordinates.","image":"Parallel_Scale_Nomogram.svg.png.webp","url":"Nomogram"}
