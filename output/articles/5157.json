{"title":"Expansion (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, expansion is a polytope operation where facets are separated and moved radially apart, and new facets are formed at separated elements (vertices, edges, etc.). Equivalently this operation can be imagined by keeping facets in the same position but reducing their size.","image":"Expanding_pentagon.png.webp","url":"Expansion_(geometry)"}
