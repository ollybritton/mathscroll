{"title":"Buchholz's ordinal","summary":"In mathematics, ψ0(Ωω), widely known as Buchholz's ordinal, is a large countable ordinal that is used to measure the proof-theoretic strength of some mathematical systems. In particular, it is the proof theoretic ordinal of the subsystem Π 1 1 {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{1}^{1}} -CA0 of second-order arithmetic;[1][2] this is one of the \"big five\" subsystems studied in reverse mathematics (Simpson 1999). It is also the proof-theoretic ordinal of I D < ω {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {ID_{<\\omega }}}} , the theory of finitely iterated inductive definitions, and of K P ℓ 0 {\\displaystyle KP\\ell _{0}} ,[3] a fragment of Kripke-Platek set theory extended by an axiom stating every set is contained in an admissible set. Buchholz's ordinal is also the order type of the segment bounded by D 0 D ω 0 {\\displaystyle D_{0}D_{\\omega }0} in Buchholz's ordinal notation ( O T , < ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {(OT,<)}}} .[1] Lastly, it can be expressed as the limit of the sequence: ε 0 = ψ 0 ( Ω ) {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon _{0}=\\psi _{0}(\\Omega )} , B H O = ψ 0 ( Ω 2 ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathsf {BHO}}=\\psi _{0}(\\Omega _{2})} , ψ 0 ( Ω 3 ) {\\displaystyle \\psi _{0}(\\Omega _{3})} , ...","image":"0fd076fb78a7a5ee340920a3d846ddf67455f941.svg","url":"Buchholz's_ordinal"}
