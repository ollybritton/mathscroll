{"title":"Bitruncated cubic honeycomb","summary":"The bitruncated cubic honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 3-space made up of truncated octahedra (or, equivalently, bitruncated cubes). It has 4 truncated octahedra around each vertex. Being composed entirely of truncated octahedra, it is cell-transitive. It is also edge-transitive, with 2 hexagons and one square on each edge, and vertex-transitive. It is one of 28 uniform honeycombs.","image":"Bitruncated_cubic_tiling.png.webp","url":"Bitruncated_cubic_honeycomb"}
