{"title":"Index of a subgroup","summary":"In mathematics, specifically group theory, the index of a subgroup H in a group G is the number of left cosets of H in G, or equivalently, the number of right cosets of H in G. The index is denoted | G : H | {\\displaystyle |G:H|} or [ G : H ] {\\displaystyle [G:H]} or ( G : H ) {\\displaystyle (G:H)} . Because G is the disjoint union of the left cosets and because each left coset has the same size as H, the index is related to the orders of the two groups by the formula","image":"5114d15a8b2d77dae8c98f1c523d7fdd1a03d814.svg","url":"Index_of_a_subgroup"}
