{"title":"Computable set","summary":"In computability theory, a set of natural numbers is called computable, recursive, or decidable if there is an algorithm which takes a number as input, terminates after a finite amount of time (possibly depending on the given number) and correctly decides whether the number belongs to the set or not.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Computable_set"}
