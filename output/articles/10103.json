{"title":"Mathematics Magazine","summary":"Mathematics Magazine is a refereed bimonthly publication of the Mathematical Association of America. Its intended audience is teachers of collegiate mathematics, especially at the junior/senior level, and their students. It is explicitly a journal of mathematics rather than pedagogy. Rather than articles in the terse \"theorem-proof\" style of research journals, it seeks articles which provide a context for the mathematics they deliver, with examples, applications, illustrations, and historical background.[2] Paid circulation in 2008 was 9,500 and total circulation was 10,000.[3]","image":"Mathematics_Magazine_(Cover).png.webp","url":"Mathematics_Magazine"}
