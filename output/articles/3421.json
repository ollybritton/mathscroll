{"title":"Cook–Levin theorem","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the Cook–Levin theorem, also known as Cook's theorem, states that the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete.  That is, it is in NP, and any problem in NP can be reduced in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine to the Boolean satisfiability problem.","image":"CookLevin_svg.svg.png.webp","url":"Cook–Levin_theorem"}
