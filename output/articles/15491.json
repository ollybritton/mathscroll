{"title":"Tangent half-angle substitution","summary":"In integral calculus, the tangent half-angle substitution is a change of variables used for evaluating integrals, which converts a rational function of trigonometric functions of x {\\textstyle x} into an ordinary rational function of t {\\textstyle t} by setting t = tan ‚Å° x 2 {\\textstyle t=\\tan {\\tfrac {x}{2}}} . This is the one-dimensional stereographic projection of the unit circle parametrized by angle measure onto the real line. The general[1] transformation formula is:","image":"d951e0f3b54b6a3d73bb9a0a005749046cbce781.svg","url":"Tangent_half-angle_substitution"}
