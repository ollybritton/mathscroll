{"title":"Breusch–Pagan test","summary":"In statistics, the Breusch–Pagan test, developed in 1979 by Trevor Breusch and Adrian Pagan,[1] is used to test for heteroskedasticity in a linear regression model. It was independently suggested with some extension by R. Dennis Cook and Sanford Weisberg in 1983 (Cook–Weisberg test).[2] Derived from the Lagrange multiplier test principle, it tests whether the variance of the errors from a regression is dependent on the values of the independent variables. In that case, heteroskedasticity is present.","image":"dff22338be295e0d66984838ee5b1148704b3324.svg","url":"Breusch–Pagan_test"}
