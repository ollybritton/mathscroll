{"title":"Erdős–Szekeres theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Erdős–Szekeres theorem asserts that, given r, s, any sequence of distinct real numbers with length at least (r − 1)(s − 1) + 1 contains a monotonically increasing subsequence of length r or a monotonically decreasing subsequence of length s. The proof appeared in the same 1935 paper that mentions the Happy Ending problem.[1]","image":"Monotone-subseq-17-5.svg.png.webp","url":"Erdős–Szekeres_theorem"}
