{"title":"Quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations","summary":"The quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, also called HHL algorithm, designed by Aram Harrow, Avinatan Hassidim, and Seth Lloyd, is a quantum algorithm published in 2008 for solving linear systems. The algorithm estimates the result of a scalar measurement on the solution vector to a given linear system of equations.[1]","image":"54ddec2e922c5caea4e47d04feef86e782dc8e6d.svg","url":"Quantum_algorithm_for_linear_systems_of_equations"}
