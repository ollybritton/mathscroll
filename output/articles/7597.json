{"title":"Icosahedral pyramid","summary":"The icosahedral pyramid is a four-dimensional convex polytope, bounded by one icosahedron as its base and by 20 triangular pyramid cells which meet at its apex. Since an icosahedron's circumradius is less than its edge length,[1] the tetrahedral pyramids can be made with regular faces.","image":"Icosahedral_pyramid.png.webp","url":"Icosahedral_pyramid"}
