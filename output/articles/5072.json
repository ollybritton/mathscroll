{"title":"Euler characteristic of an orbifold","summary":"In differential geometry, the Euler characteristic of an orbifold, or orbifold Euler characteristic, is a generalization of the topological Euler characteristic that includes contributions coming from nontrivial automorphisms. In particular, unlike a topological Euler characteristic, it is not restricted to integer values and is in general a rational number. It is of interest in mathematical physics, specifically in string theory. Given a compact manifold M {\\displaystyle M} quotiented by a finite group G {\\displaystyle G} , the Euler characteristic of M / G {\\displaystyle M/G} is","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Euler_characteristic_of_an_orbifold"}
