{"title":"Gauss's continued fraction","summary":"In complex analysis, Gauss's continued fraction is a particular class of continued fractions derived from hypergeometric functions. It was one of the first analytic continued fractions known to mathematics, and it can be used to represent several important elementary functions, as well as some of the more complicated transcendental functions.","image":"ebc673ecedfb6fbf3add38056d638da3389dd65f.svg","url":"Gauss's_continued_fraction"}
