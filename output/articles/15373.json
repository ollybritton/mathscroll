{"title":"Symmetric inverse semigroup","summary":"In abstract algebra, the set of all partial bijections on a set X (a.k.a. one-to-one partial transformations) forms an inverse semigroup, called the symmetric inverse semigroup[1] (actually a monoid) on X. The conventional notation for the symmetric inverse semigroup on a set X is I X {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {I}}_{X}} [2] or I S X {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {IS}}_{X}} .[3] In general I X {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {I}}_{X}} is not commutative.","image":"c423f174131c34def87296e542eabcb2838141d2.svg","url":"Symmetric_inverse_semigroup"}
