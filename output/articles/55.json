{"title":"2 + 2 = 5","summary":"\"Two plus two equals five\" (2 + 2 = 5) is a mathematically incorrect phrase used in the 1949 dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. It appears as a possible statement of Ingsoc (English Socialism) philosophy, like the dogma \"War is Peace\", which the Party expects the citizens of Oceania to believe is true. In writing his secret diary in the year 1984, the protagonist Winston Smith ponders if the Inner Party might declare that \"two plus two equals five\" is a fact. Smith further ponders whether or not belief in such a consensus reality makes the lie true.[1]","image":"page7-220px-Allais_-_Deux_et_deux_font_cinq_(2%2B2%3D5).djvu.jpg.webp","url":"2_+_2_=_5"}
