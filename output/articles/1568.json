{"title":"Biaugmented pentagonal prism","summary":"In geometry, the biaugmented pentagonal prism is one of the Johnson solids (J53). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by doubly augmenting a pentagonal prism by attaching square pyramids (J1) to two of its nonadjacent equatorial faces. (The solid obtained by attaching pyramids to adjacent equatorial faces is not convex, and thus not a Johnson solid.)","image":"Biaugmented_pentagonal_prism.png.webp","url":"Biaugmented_pentagonal_prism"}
