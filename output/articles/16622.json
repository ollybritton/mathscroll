{"title":"Viscosity solution","summary":"In mathematics, the viscosity solution concept was introduced in the early 1980s by Pierre-Louis Lions and Michael G. Crandall as a generalization of the classical concept of what is meant by a 'solution' to a partial differential equation (PDE).  It has been found that the viscosity solution is the natural solution concept to use in many applications of PDE's, including for example first order equations arising in dynamic programming (the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation), differential games (the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation) or front evolution problems,[1][2] as well as second-order equations such as the ones arising in stochastic optimal control or stochastic differential games.","image":"fd81e368e6b2f9b70dc6f8536d9f434f6d9fa5e5.svg","url":"Viscosity_solution"}
