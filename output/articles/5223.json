{"title":"Extravagant number","summary":"In number theory, an extravagant number (also known as a wasteful number) is a natural number in a given number base that has fewer digits than the number of digits in its prime factorization in the given number base (including exponents).[1] For example, in base 10, 4 = 22, 6 = 2×3, 8 = 23, and 9 = 32 are extravagant numbers (sequence A046760 in the OEIS).","image":"0041c936812fb809c4511e31eb0404de9d48511b.svg","url":"Extravagant_number"}
