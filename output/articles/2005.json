{"title":"Browder–Minty theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Browder–Minty theorem (sometimes called the Minty–Browder theorem) states that a bounded, continuous, coercive and monotone function T from a real, separable reflexive Banach space X into its continuous dual space X∗ is automatically surjective. That is, for each continuous linear functional g ∈ X∗, there exists a solution u ∈ X of the equation T(u) = g. (Note that T itself is not required to be a linear map.)","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Browder–Minty_theorem"}
