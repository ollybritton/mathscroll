{"title":"Variational multiscale method","summary":"The variational multiscale method (VMS) is a technique used for deriving models and numerical methods for multiscale phenomena.[1] The VMS framework has been mainly applied to design stabilized finite element methods in which stability of the standard Galerkin method is not ensured both in terms of singular perturbation and of compatibility conditions with the finite element spaces.[2]","image":"560e89b6c69b4e4184c3528eb4f5e36f31b0cbc4.svg","url":"Variational_multiscale_method"}
