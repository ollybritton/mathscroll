{"title":"Tensor product","summary":"In mathematics, the tensor product V ⊗ W {\\displaystyle V\\otimes W} of two vector spaces V and W (over the same field) is a vector space to which is associated a bilinear map V × W → V ⊗ W {\\displaystyle V\\times W\\to V\\otimes W} that maps a pair ( v , w ) , v ∈ V , w ∈ W {\\displaystyle (v,w),\\ v\\in V,w\\in W} to an element of V ⊗ W {\\displaystyle V\\otimes W} denoted v ⊗ w . {\\displaystyle v\\otimes w.}","image":"a0d8e48e05a95d9c68f80f49e3d509ba9de064c9.svg","url":"Tensor_product"}
