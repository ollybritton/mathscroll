{"title":"Auction algorithm","summary":"The term \"auction algorithm\"[1] applies to several variations of a combinatorial optimization algorithm which solves assignment problems, and network optimization problems with linear and convex/nonlinear cost.  An auction algorithm has been used in a business setting to determine the best prices on a set of products offered to multiple buyers. It is an iterative procedure, so the name \"auction algorithm\" is related to a sales auction, where multiple bids are compared to determine the best offer, with the final sales going to the highest bidders.","image":"Microcosm_of_London_Plate_006_-_Auction_Room%2C_Christie's_(colour).jpg.webp","url":"Auction_algorithm"}
