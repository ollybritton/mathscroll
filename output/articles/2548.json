{"title":"Cheeger constant (graph theory)","summary":"In mathematics, the Cheeger constant (also Cheeger number or isoperimetric number) of a graph is a numerical measure of whether or not a graph has a \"bottleneck\". The Cheeger constant as a measure of \"bottleneckedness\" is of great interest in many areas: for example, constructing well-connected networks of computers, card shuffling. The graph theoretical notion originated after the Cheeger isoperimetric constant of a compact Riemannian manifold.","image":"1acfc4ea06acc2313f88e4105d8f63fd1aa5ce9c.svg","url":"Cheeger_constant_(graph_theory)"}
