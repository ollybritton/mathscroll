{"title":"Addition-chain exponentiation","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, optimal addition-chain exponentiation is a method of exponentiation by a positive integer power that requires a minimal number of multiplications. Using the form of the shortest addition chain, with multiplication instead of addition, computes the desired exponent (instead of multiple) of the base. (This corresponds to OEIS sequence A003313 (Length of shortest addition chain for n).) Each exponentiation in the chain can be evaluated by multiplying two of the earlier exponentiation results. More generally, addition-chain exponentiation may also refer to exponentiation by non-minimal addition chains constructed by a variety of algorithms (since a shortest addition chain is very difficult to find).","image":"df6b0c397c4ac1d81a12becfd276b0ba6382daa3.svg","url":"Addition-chain_exponentiation"}
