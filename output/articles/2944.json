{"title":"Compactly generated group","summary":"In mathematics, a compactly generated (topological) group is a topological group G which is algebraically generated by one of its compact subsets.[1] This should not be confused with the unrelated notion (widely used in algebraic topology) of a compactly generated space -- one whose topology is generated (in a suitable sense) by its compact subspaces.","image":"4bd7ad0d149a392c1e5aecea996db8f8fddb2f2f.svg","url":"Compactly_generated_group"}
