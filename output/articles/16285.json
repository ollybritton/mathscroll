{"title":"Type theory","summary":"In mathematics, logic, and computer science, a type theory is the formal presentation of a specific type system,[lower-alpha 1] and in general type theory is the academic study of type systems. Some type theories serve as alternatives to set theory as a foundation of mathematics. Two influential type theories that were proposed as foundations are Alonzo Church's typed λ-calculus and Per Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory.  Most computerized proof-writing systems use a type theory for their foundation.  A common one is Thierry Coquand's Calculus of Inductive Constructions.","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"Type_theory"}
