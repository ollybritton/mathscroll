{"title":"Continuous q-Jacobi polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the continuous q-Jacobi polynomials P(α,β)n(x|q),  introduced by Askey & Wilson (1985), are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme. Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties.","image":"dcd18c7ed289efd168269972da5d18b89ed13bde.svg","url":"Continuous_q-Jacobi_polynomials"}
