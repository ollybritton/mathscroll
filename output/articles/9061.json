{"title":"Lattice multiplication","summary":"Lattice multiplication, also known as the Italian method, Chinese method, Chinese lattice, gelosia multiplication,[1] sieve multiplication, shabakh, diagonally or Venetian squares, is a method of multiplication that uses a lattice to multiply two multi-digit numbers. It is mathematically identical to the more commonly used long multiplication algorithm, but it breaks the process into smaller steps, which some practitioners find easier to use.[2]","image":"Example_of_step_1_of_lattice_(shabakh)_multiplication_algorithm.svg.png.webp","url":"Lattice_multiplication"}
