{"title":"Goppa code","summary":"In mathematics, an algebraic geometric code (AG-code), otherwise known as a Goppa code, is a general type of linear code constructed by using an algebraic curve X {\\displaystyle X} over a finite field F q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{q}} . Such codes were introduced by Valerii Denisovich Goppa. In particular cases, they can have interesting extremal properties, making them useful for a variety of error detection and correction problems.[1]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Goppa_code"}
