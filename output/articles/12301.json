{"title":"Poloidal–toroidal decomposition","summary":"In vector calculus, a topic in pure and applied mathematics, a poloidal–toroidal decomposition is a restricted form of the Helmholtz decomposition. It is often used in the spherical coordinates analysis of solenoidal vector fields, for example, magnetic fields and incompressible fluids.[1]","image":"e2b17c499d63a8b7098b1672da07bda508fc17a5.svg","url":"Poloidal–toroidal_decomposition"}
