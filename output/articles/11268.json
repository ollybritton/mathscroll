{"title":"Null distribution","summary":"In statistical hypothesis testing, the null distribution is the probability distribution of the test statistic when the null hypothesis is true.[1] For example, in an F-test, the null distribution is an F-distribution.[2] Null distribution is a tool scientists often use when conducting experiments. The null distribution is the distribution of two sets of data under a null hypothesis. If the results of the two sets of data are not outside the parameters of the expected results, then the null hypothesis is said to be true.","image":"Null_and_alternative_distribution.jpg.webp","url":"Null_distribution"}
