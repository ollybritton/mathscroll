{"title":"Equiangular polygon","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, an equiangular polygon is a polygon whose vertex angles are equal. If the lengths of the sides are also equal (that is, if it is also equilateral) then it is a regular polygon. Isogonal polygons are equiangular polygons which alternate two edge lengths.","image":"Equiangular_rectangle2x3.svg.png.webp","url":"Equiangular_polygon"}
