{"title":"Sequential space","summary":"In topology and related fields of mathematics, a sequential space is a topological space whose topology can be completely characterized by its convergent/divergent sequences. They can be thought of as spaces that satisfy a very weak axiom of countability, and all first-countable spaces (especially metric spaces) are sequential.","image":"2a40cd58d2e96a1b83e7713d38dd1576d14bb72e.svg","url":"Sequential_space"}
