{"title":"Gradian","summary":"In trigonometry, the gradian, also known as the gon (from Ancient Greek: γωνία, romanized: gōnía, lit. 'angle'), grad, or grade,[1] is a unit of measurement of an angle, defined as one hundredth of the right angle; in other words, there are 100 gradians in 90 degrees.[2][3][4] It is equivalent to 1/400 of a turn,[5] 9/10 of a degree, or π/200 of a radian. Measuring angles in gradians is said to employ the centesimal system of angular measurement, initiated as part of metrication and decimalisation efforts.[6][7][8][Note 1]","image":"Boussole_en_grades_table_conversion_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Gradian"}
