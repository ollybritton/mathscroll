{"title":"Bent function","summary":"In the mathematical field of combinatorics, a bent function is a special type of Boolean function which is maximally non-linear; it is as different as possible from the set of all linear and affine functions when measured by Hamming distance between truth tables. Concretely, this means the maximum correlation between the output of the function and a linear function is minimal. In addition, the derivatives of a bent function are a balanced Boolean functions, so for any change in the input variables there is a 50 percent chance that the output value will change.","image":"Boolean_functions_like_1000_nonlinearity.svg.png.webp","url":"Bent_function"}
