{"title":"Projection (relational algebra)","summary":"In relational algebra, a projection is a unary operation written as Π a 1 , . . . , a n ( R ) {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{a_{1},...,a_{n}}(R)} , where R {\\displaystyle R} is a relation and a 1 , . . . , a n {\\displaystyle a_{1},...,a_{n}} are attribute names. Its result is defined as the set obtained when the components of the tuples in R {\\displaystyle R} are restricted to the set { a 1 , . . . , a n } {\\displaystyle \\{a_{1},...,a_{n}\\}} – it discards (or excludes) the other attributes.[1]","image":"b0ddbd93407ce2992a1593be70d71e7a674d706e.svg","url":"Projection_(relational_algebra)"}
