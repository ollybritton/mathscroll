{"title":"Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm","summary":"The Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász (LLL) lattice basis reduction algorithm is a polynomial time lattice reduction algorithm invented by Arjen Lenstra, Hendrik Lenstra and László Lovász in 1982.[1] Given a basis B = { b 1 , b 2 , … , b d } {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {B} =\\{\\mathbf {b} _{1},\\mathbf {b} _{2},\\dots ,\\mathbf {b} _{d}\\}} with n-dimensional integer coordinates, for a lattice L (a discrete subgroup of  Rn) with d ≤ n {\\displaystyle d\\leq n} , the LLL algorithm calculates an LLL-reduced (short, nearly orthogonal) lattice basis in time","image":"1a80e364e6bfdd82046b2abc7e9cac672e0f344d.svg","url":"Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász_lattice_basis_reduction_algorithm"}
