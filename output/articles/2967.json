{"title":"Complemented lattice","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of order theory, a complemented lattice is a bounded lattice (with least element 0 and greatest element 1), in which every element a has a complement, i.e. an element b satisfying a ∨ b = 1 and a ∧ b = 0. Complements need not be unique.","image":"Fano_plane_Hasse_diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Complemented_lattice"}
