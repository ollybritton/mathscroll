{"title":"Gram–Euler theorem","summary":"In geometry, the Gram–Euler theorem,[1] Gram-Sommerville, Brianchon-Gram or Gram relation[2] (named after Jørgen Pedersen Gram, Leonhard Euler, Duncan Sommerville and Charles Julien Brianchon) is a generalization of the internal angle sum formula of polygons to higher-dimensional polytopes. The equation constrains the sums of the interior angles of a polytope in a manner analogous to the Euler relation on the number of d-dimensional faces.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Gram–Euler_theorem"}
