{"title":"Fractal compression","summary":"Fractal compression is a lossy compression method for digital images, based on fractals. The method is best suited for textures and natural images, relying on the fact that parts of an image often resemble other parts of the same image.[1] Fractal algorithms convert these parts into mathematical data called \"fractal codes\" which are used to recreate the encoded image.","image":"Zasada_dzialania_ifs_1.png.webp","url":"Fractal_compression"}
