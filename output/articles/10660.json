{"title":"Monoidal t-norm logic","summary":"In mathematical logic, monoidal t-norm based logic (or shortly MTL), the logic of left-continuous t-norms, is one of the t-norm fuzzy logics. It belongs to the broader class of substructural logics, or logics of residuated lattices;[1] it extends the logic of commutative bounded integral residuated lattices (known as HÃ¶hle's monoidal logic, Ono's FLew, or intuitionistic logic without contraction) by the axiom of prelinearity.","image":"738f7d23bb2d9642bab520020873cccbef49768d.svg","url":"Monoidal_t-norm_logic"}
