{"title":"Crystalline cohomology","summary":"In mathematics, crystalline cohomology is a Weil cohomology theory for schemes X over a base field k.  Its values Hn(X/W) are modules over the ring W of Witt vectors over k.  It was introduced by Alexander Grothendieck (1966, 1968) and developed by Pierre Berthelot (1974).","image":"f066e981e530bacc07efc6a10fa82deee985929e.svg","url":"Crystalline_cohomology"}
