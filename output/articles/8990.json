{"title":"Lanczos resampling","summary":"Lanczos filtering and Lanczos resampling are two applications of a mathematical formula. It can be used as a low-pass filter or used to smoothly interpolate the value of a digital signal between its samples.  In the latter case, it maps each sample of the given signal to a translated and scaled copy of the Lanczos kernel, which is a sinc function windowed by the central lobe of a second, longer, sinc function.  The sum of these translated and scaled kernels is then evaluated at the desired points.","image":"Lanczos-r01-filtering.svg.png.webp","url":"Lanczos_resampling"}
