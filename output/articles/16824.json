{"title":"Weil group","summary":"In mathematics, a Weil group, introduced by Weil (1951), is a modification of the absolute Galois group of a local or global field, used in class field theory.  For such a field F, its Weil group is generally denoted WF. There also exists \"finite level\" modifications of the Galois groups: if E/F is a finite extension, then the relative Weil group of E/F is WE/F = WF/W cE  (where the superscript c denotes the commutator subgroup).","image":"41996de8f059bbd70c71fcea8e9c6d181a9c6fc5.svg","url":"Weil_group"}
