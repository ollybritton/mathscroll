{"title":"Covering problems","summary":"In combinatorics and computer science, covering problems are computational problems that ask whether a certain combinatorial structure 'covers' another, or how large the structure has to be to do that. Covering problems are minimization problems and usually integer linear programs, whose dual problems are called packing problems.","image":"a37a8d9469b1503805a581a834511dd4520ba2bd.svg","url":"Covering_problems"}
