{"title":"Normed vector lattice","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, a normed lattice is a topological vector lattice that is also a normed space whose unit ball is a solid set.[1] Normed lattices are important in the theory of topological vector lattices. They are closely related to Banach vector lattices, which are normed vector lattices that are also Banach spaces.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Normed_vector_lattice"}
