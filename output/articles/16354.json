{"title":"Uniform coloring","summary":"In geometry, a uniform coloring is a property of a uniform figure (uniform tiling or uniform polyhedron) that is colored to be vertex-transitive. Different symmetries can be expressed on the same geometric figure with the faces following different uniform color patterns.","image":"Uniform_tiling_63-t0.png.webp","url":"Uniform_coloring"}
