{"title":"Binary octahedral group","summary":"In mathematics, the binary octahedral group, name as 2O or ⟨2,3,4⟩[1] is a certain nonabelian group of order 48. It is an extension of the chiral octahedral group O or (2,3,4) of order 24 by a cyclic group of order 2, and is the preimage of the octahedral group under the 2:1 covering homomorphism Spin ⁡ ( 3 ) → SO ⁡ ( 3 ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Spin} (3)\\to \\operatorname {SO} (3)} of the special orthogonal group by the spin group. It follows that the binary octahedral group is a discrete subgroup of Spin(3) of order 48.","image":"0e7351eed905ead38bd5c173c9137de511793a03.svg","url":"Binary_octahedral_group"}
