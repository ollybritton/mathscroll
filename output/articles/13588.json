{"title":"Rijndael MixColumns","summary":"The MixColumns operation performed by the Rijndael cipher, along with the ShiftRows step, is the primary source of diffusion in Rijndael. Each column is treated as a four-term polynomial b ( x ) = b 3 x 3 + b 2 x 2 + b 1 x + b 0 {\\displaystyle b(x)=b_{3}x^{3}+b_{2}x^{2}+b_{1}x+b_{0}} which are elements within the field GF ⁡ ( 2 8 ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {GF} (2^{8})} . The coefficients of the polynomials are elements within the prime sub-field GF ⁡ ( 2 ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {GF} (2)} .","image":"e097416140342c15c41f55becb9436e87024d320.svg","url":"Rijndael_MixColumns"}
