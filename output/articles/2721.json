{"title":"Classification of discontinuities","summary":"Continuous functions are of utmost importance in mathematics, functions and applications. However, not all functions are continuous. If a function is not continuous at a point in its domain, one says that it has a discontinuity there. The set of all points of discontinuity of a function may be a discrete set, a dense set, or even the entire domain of the function.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Classification_of_discontinuities"}
