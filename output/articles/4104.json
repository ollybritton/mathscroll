{"title":"Differentiation of integrals","summary":"In mathematics, the problem of differentiation of integrals is that of determining under what circumstances the mean value integral of a suitable function on a small neighbourhood of a point approximates the value of the function at that point.  More formally, given a space X with a measure μ and a metric d, one asks for what functions f : X → R does","image":"84a68a9a006b6fbae17acd24c5ea569d214005c0.svg","url":"Differentiation_of_integrals"}
