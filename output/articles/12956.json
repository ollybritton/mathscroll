{"title":"Quaternion algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a quaternion algebra over a field F is a central simple algebra A over F[1][2] that has dimension 4 over F. Every quaternion algebra becomes a matrix algebra by extending scalars (equivalently, tensoring with a field extension), i.e. for a suitable field extension K of F, A ⊗ F K {\\displaystyle A\\otimes _{F}K} is isomorphic to the 2 × 2 matrix algebra over K.","image":"bb1b4bbe9b3b3c80d72ca0e62f7fe7f0bfc09086.svg","url":"Quaternion_algebra"}
