{"title":"Eckmann–Hilton argument","summary":"In mathematics, the Eckmann–Hilton argument (or Eckmann–Hilton principle or Eckmann–Hilton theorem) is an argument about two unital magma structures on a set where one is a homomorphism for the other. Given this, the structures are the same, and the resulting magma is a commutative monoid. This can then be used to prove the commutativity of the higher homotopy groups. The principle is named after Beno Eckmann and Peter Hilton, who used it in a 1962 paper.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Eckmann–Hilton_argument"}
