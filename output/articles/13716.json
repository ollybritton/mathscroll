{"title":"Rota's basis conjecture","summary":"In linear algebra and matroid theory, Rota's basis conjecture is an unproven conjecture concerning rearrangements of bases, named after Gian-Carlo Rota. It states that, if X is either a vector space of dimension n or more generally a matroid of rank n, with n disjoint bases Bi, then it is possible to arrange the elements of these bases into an n × n matrix in such a way that the rows of the matrix are exactly the given bases and the columns of the matrix are also bases. That is, it should be possible to find a second set of n disjoint bases Ci, each of which consists of one element from each of the bases Bi.","image":"Rota's_basis_conjecture_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Rota's_basis_conjecture"}
