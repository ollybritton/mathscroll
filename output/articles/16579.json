{"title":"Vertex enumeration problem","summary":"In mathematics, the vertex enumeration problem for a polytope, a polyhedral cell complex, a hyperplane arrangement, or some other object of discrete geometry, is the problem of determination of the object's vertices given some formal representation of the object. A classical example is the problem of enumeration of the vertices of a convex polytope specified by a set of linear inequalities:[1]","image":"08249140bbb640be6c1242b705a896fb8951886f.svg","url":"Vertex_enumeration_problem"}
