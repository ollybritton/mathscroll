{"title":"Empty product","summary":"In mathematics, an empty product, or nullary product or vacuous product, is the result of multiplying no factors. It is by convention equal to the multiplicative identity (assuming there is an identity for the multiplication operation in question), just as the empty sum—the result of adding no numbers—is by convention zero, or the additive identity.[1][2][3][4] When numbers are implied, the empty product becomes one.","image":"9a9a6153c335d8430d5595572462bdd8c5c130da.svg","url":"Empty_product"}
