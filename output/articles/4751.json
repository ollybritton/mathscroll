{"title":"Elliptic curve primality","summary":"In mathematics, elliptic curve primality testing techniques, or elliptic curve primality proving (ECPP), are among the quickest and most widely used methods in primality proving.[1] It is an idea put forward by Shafi Goldwasser and Joe Kilian in 1986 and turned into an algorithm by A. O. L. Atkin the same year.  The algorithm was altered and improved by several collaborators subsequently, and notably by Atkin and Fran√ßois Morain, in 1993.[2]  The concept of using elliptic curves in factorization had been developed by H. W. Lenstra in 1985, and the implications for its use in primality testing (and proving) followed quickly.","image":"6d8ac360f91011bee42f5bcee92540d4ff1e3670.svg","url":"Elliptic_curve_primality"}
