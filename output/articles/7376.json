{"title":"Homothetic center","summary":"In geometry, a homothetic center (also called a center of similarity or a center of similitude) is a point from which at least two geometrically similar figures can be seen as a dilation or contraction of one another. If the center is external, the two figures are directly similar to one another; their angles have the same rotational sense. If the center is internal, the two figures are scaled mirror images of one another; their angles have the opposite sense.","image":"Geom_podobnost_stejnolehlest.svg.png.webp","url":"Homothetic_center"}
