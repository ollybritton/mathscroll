{"title":"Cantellated tesseractic honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the cantellated tesseractic honeycomb is a uniform  space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 4-space. It is constructed by a cantellation of a tesseractic honeycomb creating cantellated tesseracts, and new 24-cell and octahedral prism facets at the original vertices.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Cantellated_tesseractic_honeycomb"}
