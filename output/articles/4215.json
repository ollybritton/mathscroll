{"title":"Dirichlet eigenvalue","summary":"In mathematics, the Dirichlet eigenvalues are the fundamental modes of vibration of an idealized drum with a given shape.  The problem of whether one can hear the shape of a drum is: given the Dirichlet eigenvalues, what features of the shape of the drum can one deduce.  Here a \"drum\" is thought of as an elastic membrane Ω, which is represented as a planar domain whose boundary is fixed. The Dirichlet eigenvalues are found by solving the following problem for an unknown function u ≠ 0 and eigenvalue λ","image":"381229953243c39efe4a1fb416e56ea7f5394932.svg","url":"Dirichlet_eigenvalue"}
