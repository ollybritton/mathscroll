{"title":"Diagonal","summary":"In geometry, a diagonal is a line segment joining two vertices of a polygon or polyhedron, when those vertices are not on the same edge.  Informally, any sloping line is called diagonal.  The word diagonal derives from the ancient Greek διαγώνιος diagonios,[1] \"from angle to angle\" (from  διά- dia-, \"through\", \"across\" and γωνία gonia, \"angle\", related to gony \"knee\"); it was used by both Strabo[2] and Euclid[3] to refer to a line connecting two vertices of a rhombus or cuboid,[4] and later adopted into Latin as diagonus (\"slanting line\").","image":"Cube_diagonals.svg.png.webp","url":"Diagonal"}
