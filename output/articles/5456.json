{"title":"Finite type invariant","summary":"In the mathematical theory of knots, a finite type invariant, or Vassiliev invariant (so named after Victor Anatolyevich Vassiliev), is a knot invariant that can be extended (in a precise manner to be described) to an invariant of certain singular knots that vanishes on singular knots with m + 1 singularities and does not vanish on some singular knot with 'm' singularities.  It is then said to be of type or order m.","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg","url":"Finite_type_invariant"}
