{"title":"Tate's algorithm","summary":"In the theory of elliptic curves, Tate's algorithm takes as input an integral model of an elliptic curve E over Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } , or more generally an algebraic number field, and a prime or prime ideal p. It returns the exponent fp of p in the conductor of E, the type of reduction at p, the local index","image":"c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a.svg","url":"Tate's_algorithm"}
