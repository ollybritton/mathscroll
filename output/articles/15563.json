{"title":"Tensor algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the tensor algebra of a vector space V, denoted T(V) or Tâ€¢(V), is the algebra of tensors on V (of any rank) with multiplication being the tensor product. It is the free algebra on V, in the sense of being left adjoint to the forgetful functor from algebras to vector spaces: it is the \"most general\" algebra containing V, in the sense of the corresponding universal property (see below).","image":"1f2281dbd92db9b20688a64fb57f5e4e461cc86b.svg","url":"Tensor_algebra"}
