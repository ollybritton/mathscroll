{"title":"Descartes' rule of signs","summary":"In mathematics, Descartes' rule of signs, first described by René Descartes in his work La Géométrie, is a technique for getting information on the number of positive real roots of a polynomial. It asserts that the number of positive roots is at most the number of sign changes in the sequence of polynomial's coefficients (omitting the zero coefficients), and that the difference between these two numbers is always even. This implies, in particular, that if the number of sign changes is zero or one, then there are exactly zero or one positive roots, respectively.","image":"7245863fa4abf24283dac1d221a034a327f9fe4d.svg","url":"Descartes'_rule_of_signs"}
