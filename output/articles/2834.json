{"title":"Cofiniteness","summary":"In mathematics, a cofinite subset of a set X {\\displaystyle X} is a subset A {\\displaystyle A} whose complement in X {\\displaystyle X} is a finite set. In other words, A {\\displaystyle A} contains all but finitely many elements of X . {\\displaystyle X.} If the complement is not finite, but is countable, then one says the set is cocountable.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Cofiniteness"}
