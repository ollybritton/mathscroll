{"title":"Rook's graph","summary":"In graph theory, a rook's graph is an undirected graph that represents all legal moves of the rook chess piece on a chessboard. Each vertex of a rook's graph represents a square on a chessboard, and there is an edge between any two squares sharing a row (rank) or column (file), the squares that a rook can move between. These graphs can be constructed for chessboards of any rectangular shape. Although rook's graphs have only minor significance in chess lore, they are more important in the abstract mathematics of graphs through their alternative constructions: rook's graphs are the Cartesian product of two complete graphs, are the line graphs of complete bipartite graphs. The square rook's graphs constitute the two-dimensional Hamming graphs.","image":"Rook's_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Rook's_graph"}
