{"title":"Plünnecke–Ruzsa inequality","summary":"In additive combinatorics, the Plünnecke–Ruzsa inequality is an inequality that bounds the size of various sumsets of a set B {\\displaystyle B} , given that there is another set A {\\displaystyle A} so that A + B {\\displaystyle A+B} is not much larger than A {\\displaystyle A} . A slightly weaker version of this inequality was originally proven and published by Helmut Plünnecke (1970).[1] Imre Ruzsa (1989)[2] later published a simpler proof of the current, more general, version of the inequality. The inequality forms a crucial step in the proof of Freiman's theorem.","image":"47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a.svg","url":"Plünnecke–Ruzsa_inequality"}
