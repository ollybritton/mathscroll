{"title":"Tonelli–Shanks algorithm","summary":"The Tonelli–Shanks algorithm (referred to by Shanks as the RESSOL algorithm) is used in modular arithmetic to solve for r in a congruence of the form r2 ≡ n (mod p), where p is a prime: that is, to find a square root of n modulo p.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Tonelli–Shanks_algorithm"}
