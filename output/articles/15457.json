{"title":"Table of Clebsch–Gordan coefficients","summary":"This is a table of Clebsch–Gordan coefficients used for adding angular momentum values in quantum mechanics. The overall sign of the coefficients for each set of constant j 1 {\\displaystyle j_{1}} , j 2 {\\displaystyle j_{2}} , j {\\displaystyle j} is arbitrary to some degree and has been fixed according to the Condon–Shortley and Wigner sign convention as discussed by Baird and Biedenharn.[1]  Tables with the same sign convention may be found in the Particle Data Group's Review of Particle Properties[2] and in online tables.[3]","image":"0a671019a672cd149a8d1584861e2f8fe9728a9e.svg","url":"Table_of_Clebsch–Gordan_coefficients"}
