{"title":"DiVincenzo's criteria","summary":"The DiVincenzo criteria are conditions necessary for constructing a quantum computer, conditions proposed in 2000 by the theoretical physicist David P. DiVincenzo,[1] as being those necessary to construct such a computer—a computer first proposed by mathematician Yuri Manin, in 1980,[2] and physicist Richard Feynman, in 1982[3]—as a means to efficiently simulate quantum systems, such as in solving the quantum many-body problem.","image":"d98a15477054152f5089aeedcea88a97e079cfd9.svg","url":"DiVincenzo's_criteria"}
