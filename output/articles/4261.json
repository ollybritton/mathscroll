{"title":"Discrete q-Hermite polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the discrete q-Hermite polynomials  are two closely related families hn(x;q) and ĥn(x;q) of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme, introduced by Al-Salam and Carlitz (1965). Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties. hn(x;q) is also called discrete q-Hermite I polynomials and ĥn(x;q) is also called discrete q-Hermite II polynomials.","image":"0367e87beaec544d39e524e25ca40bee8994af79.svg","url":"Discrete_q-Hermite_polynomials"}
