{"title":"Cake number","summary":"In mathematics, the cake number, denoted by Cn, is the maximum of the number of regions into which a 3-dimensional cube can be partitioned by exactly n planes. The cake number is so-called because one may imagine each partition of the cube by a plane as a slice made by a knife through a cube-shaped cake. It is the 3D analogue of the lazy caterer's sequence.","image":"Cake_number_with_4_cutting_planes.gif","url":"Cake_number"}
