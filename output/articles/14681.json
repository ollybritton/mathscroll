{"title":"Sorgenfrey plane","summary":"In topology, the Sorgenfrey plane is a frequently-cited counterexample to many otherwise plausible-sounding conjectures.  It consists of the product of two copies of the Sorgenfrey line, which is the real line R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } under the half-open interval topology. The Sorgenfrey line and plane are named for the American mathematician Robert Sorgenfrey.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Sorgenfrey_plane"}
