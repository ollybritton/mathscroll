{"title":"Games graph","summary":"In graph theory, the Games graph is the largest known locally linear strongly regular graph. Its parameters as a strongly regular graph are (729,112,1,20). This means that it has 729 vertices, and 40824 edges (112 per vertex). Each edge is in a unique triangle (it is a locally linear graph) and each non-adjacent pair of vertices have exactly 20 shared neighbors. It is named after Richard A. Games, who suggested its construction in an unpublished communication[1] and wrote about related constructions.[2]","image":"2ffd2bd276ecaaa5b660745caf55bae121bd44b6.svg","url":"Games_graph"}
