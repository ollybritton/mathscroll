{"title":"Law of the iterated logarithm","summary":"In probability theory, the law of the iterated logarithm describes the magnitude of the fluctuations of a random walk. The original statement of the law of the iterated logarithm is due to A. Ya. Khinchin (1924).[1] Another statement was given by A. N. Kolmogorov in 1929.[2]","image":"Law_of_large_numbers.gif","url":"Law_of_the_iterated_logarithm"}
