{"title":"Hardy–Littlewood Tauberian theorem","summary":"In mathematical analysis, the Hardy–Littlewood Tauberian theorem is a Tauberian theorem relating the asymptotics of the partial sums of a series with the asymptotics of its Abel summation.  In this form, the theorem asserts that if, as y ↓ 0, the non-negative sequence an is such that there is an asymptotic equivalence","image":"50daf63017c34d2178d543cd60c0e7c22802ecff.svg","url":"Hardy–Littlewood_Tauberian_theorem"}
