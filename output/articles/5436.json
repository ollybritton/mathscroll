{"title":"Finite algebra","summary":"In abstract algebra, an R {\\displaystyle R} -algebra A {\\displaystyle A} is finite if it is finitely generated as an R {\\displaystyle R} -module. An R {\\displaystyle R} -algebra can be thought as a homomorphism of rings f : R â†’ A {\\displaystyle f\\colon R\\to A} , in this case f {\\displaystyle f} is called a finite morphism if A {\\displaystyle A} is a finite R {\\displaystyle R} -algebra.[1]","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Finite_algebra"}
