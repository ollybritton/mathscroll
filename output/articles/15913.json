{"title":"Total ring of fractions","summary":"In abstract algebra, the total quotient ring,[1] or total ring of fractions,[2] is a construction that generalizes the notion of the field of fractions of an integral domain to commutative rings R that may have zero divisors. The construction embeds R in a larger ring, giving every non-zero-divisor of R an inverse in the larger ring.  If the homomorphism from R to the new ring is to be injective, no further elements can be given an inverse.","image":"Latex_integers.svg.png.webp","url":"Total_ring_of_fractions"}
