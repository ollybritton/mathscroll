{"title":"Compound of four octahedra with rotational freedom","summary":"The compound of four octahedra with rotational freedom is a uniform polyhedron compound. It consists in a symmetric arrangement of 4 octahedra, considered as triangular antiprisms. It can be constructed by superimposing four identical octahedra, and then rotating each by an equal angle Î¸ about a separate axis passing through the centres of two opposite octahedral faces, in such a way as to preserve pyritohedral symmetry.","image":"UC10-4_octahedra.png.webp","url":"Compound_of_four_octahedra_with_rotational_freedom"}
