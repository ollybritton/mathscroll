{"title":"Mycielskian","summary":"In the mathematical area of graph theory, the Mycielskian or Mycielski graph of an undirected graph is a larger graph formed from it by a construction of Jan MycielskiÂ (1955). The construction preserves the property of being triangle-free but increases the chromatic number; by applying the construction repeatedly to a triangle-free starting graph, Mycielski showed that there exist triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number.","image":"Mycielskian_construction_of_11-vertex_Grotzsch_graph.png.webp","url":"Mycielskian"}
