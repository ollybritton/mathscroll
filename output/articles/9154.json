{"title":"Legendre form","summary":"In mathematics, the Legendre forms of elliptic integrals are a canonical set of three elliptic integrals to which all others may be reduced. Legendre chose the name elliptic integrals because[1] the second kind gives the arc length of an ellipse of unit semi-major axis and eccentricity k {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle {k}} (the ellipse being defined parametrically by x = 1 − k 2 cos ⁡ ( t ) {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle {x={\\sqrt {1-k^{2}}}\\cos(t)}} , y = sin ⁡ ( t ) {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle {y=\\sin(t)}} ).","image":"588b5cf2bb4d63b21552867f5917c9c666352a8e.svg","url":"Legendre_form"}
