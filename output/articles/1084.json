{"title":"Associative array","summary":"In computer science, an associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data type that stores a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. In mathematical terms, an associative array is a function with finite domain.[1] It supports 'lookup', 'remove', and 'insert' operations.","image":"2362d80ab2b2e3530f179bd081a2af7e0aa936b7.svg","url":"Associative_array"}
