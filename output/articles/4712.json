{"title":"Elementary Number Theory, Group Theory and Ramanujan Graphs","summary":"Elementary Number Theory, Group Theory and Ramanujan Graphs is a book in mathematics whose goal is to make the construction of Ramanujan graphs accessible to undergraduate-level mathematics students. In order to do so, it covers several other significant topics in graph theory, number theory, and group theory. It was written by Giuliana Davidoff, Peter Sarnak, and Alain Valette, and published in 2003 by the Cambridge University Press, as volume 55 of the London Mathematical Society Student Texts book series.","image":"0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538.svg","url":"Elementary_Number_Theory,_Group_Theory_and_Ramanujan_Graphs"}
