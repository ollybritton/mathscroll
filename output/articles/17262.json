{"title":"♯P","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the complexity class #P (pronounced \"sharp P\" or, sometimes \"number P\" or \"hash P\") is the set of the counting problems associated with the decision problems in the set NP. More formally, #P is the class of function problems of the form \"compute f(x)\", where f is the number of accepting paths of a nondeterministic Turing machine running in polynomial time. Unlike most well-known complexity classes, it is not a class of decision problems but a class of function problems. The most difficult, representative problems of this class are #P-complete.","image":"96d0b24aea005eb2faad4e0c254c420d9783fe02.svg","url":"♯P"}
