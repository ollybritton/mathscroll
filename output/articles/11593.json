{"title":"Orthogonal coordinates","summary":"In mathematics, orthogonal coordinates are defined as a set of d coordinates q = ( q 1 , q 2 , â€¦ , q d ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {q} =(q^{1},q^{2},\\dots ,q^{d})} in which the coordinate hypersurfaces all meet at right angles (note that superscripts are indices, not exponents).  A coordinate surface for a particular coordinate qk is the curve, surface, or hypersurface on which qk is a constant.  For example, the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) is an orthogonal coordinate system, since its coordinate surfaces x = constant, y = constant, and z = constant are planes that meet at right angles to one another, i.e., are perpendicular. Orthogonal coordinates are a special but extremely common case of curvilinear coordinates.","image":"66e437acb5460dd773e107ff0050b4216e6854c5.svg","url":"Orthogonal_coordinates"}
