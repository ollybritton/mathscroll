{"title":"Cuthill–McKee algorithm","summary":"In numerical linear algebra, the Cuthill–McKee algorithm (CM), named after Elizabeth Cuthill and James McKee,[1] is an algorithm to permute a sparse matrix that has a symmetric sparsity pattern into a   band matrix form with a small bandwidth. The reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm  (RCM)  due to Alan George and Joseph Liu is the same algorithm but with the resulting index numbers reversed.[2] In practice this generally results in less fill-in  than the CM ordering when Gaussian elimination is applied.[3]","image":"Can_73_cm.svg.png.webp","url":"Cuthill–McKee_algorithm"}
