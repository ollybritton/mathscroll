{"title":"Cairo pentagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, a Cairo pentagonal tiling is a tessellation of the Euclidean plane by congruent convex pentagons, formed by overlaying two tessellations of the plane by hexagons and named for its use as a paving design in Cairo. It is also called MacMahon's net[1] after Percy Alexander MacMahon, who depicted it in his 1921 publication New Mathematical Pastimes.[2] John Horton Conway called it a 4-fold pentille.[3]","image":"Equilateral_Cairo_tiling.svg.png.webp","url":"Cairo_pentagonal_tiling"}
