{"title":"Octahedral-dodecahedral honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the octahedron-dodecahedron honeycomb is a compact uniform honeycomb, constructed from dodecahedron, octahedron, and icosidodecahedron cells, in a rhombicuboctahedron vertex figure. It has a single-ring Coxeter diagram, , and is named by its two regular cells.","image":"CDel_label5.png.webp","url":"Octahedral-dodecahedral_honeycomb"}
