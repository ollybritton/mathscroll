{"title":"Stallings theorem about ends of groups","summary":"In the mathematical subject of group theory, the Stallings theorem about ends of groups states that a finitely generated group G {\\displaystyle G} has more than one end if and only if the group G {\\displaystyle G} admits a nontrivial decomposition as an amalgamated free product or an HNN extension over a finite subgroup. In the modern language of Bassâ€“Serre theory the theorem says that a finitely generated group G {\\displaystyle G} has more than one end if and only if G {\\displaystyle G} admits a nontrivial (that is, without a global fixed point) action on a simplicial tree with finite edge-stabilizers and without edge-inversions.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Stallings_theorem_about_ends_of_groups"}
