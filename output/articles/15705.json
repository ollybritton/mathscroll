{"title":"Theta representation","summary":"In mathematics, the theta representation is a particular representation of the Heisenberg group of quantum mechanics. It gains its name from the fact that the Jacobi theta function is invariant under the action of a discrete subgroup of the Heisenberg group. The representation was popularized by David Mumford.","image":"94613d15e23941ac0013c7aa92c8d4f9b9a2f0b1.svg","url":"Theta_representation"}
