{"title":"Suspension (dynamical systems)","summary":"Suspension is a construction passing from a map to a flow. Namely, let X {\\displaystyle X} be a metric space, f : X → X {\\displaystyle f:X\\to X} be a continuous map and r : X → R + {\\displaystyle r:X\\to \\mathbb {R} ^{+}} be a function (roof function or ceiling function) bounded away from 0. Consider the quotient space:","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Suspension_(dynamical_systems)"}
