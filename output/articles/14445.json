{"title":"Singular homology","summary":"In algebraic topology, singular homology refers to the study of a certain set of algebraic invariants of a topological space X, the so-called homology groups H n ( X ) . {\\displaystyle H_{n}(X).} Intuitively, singular homology counts, for each dimension n, the n-dimensional holes of a space.  Singular homology is a particular example of a homology theory, which has now grown to be a rather broad collection of theories.  Of the various theories, it is perhaps one of the simpler ones to understand, being built on fairly concrete constructions (see also the related theory simplicial homology).","image":"db5d873b099b48660c6ca0067043fa69569e5624.svg","url":"Singular_homology"}
