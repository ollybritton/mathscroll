{"title":"Peirce's law","summary":"In logic, Peirce's law is named after the philosopher and logician Charles Sanders Peirce.  It was taken as an axiom in his first axiomatisation of propositional logic.  It can be thought of as the law of excluded middle written in a form that involves only one sort of connective, namely implication.","image":"Charles_Sanders_Peirce.jpg.webp","url":"Peirce's_law"}
