{"title":"Continued fraction","summary":"In mathematics, a continued fraction is an expression obtained through an iterative process of representing a number as the sum of its integer part and the reciprocal of another number, then writing this other number as the sum of its integer part and another reciprocal, and so on.[1] In a finite continued fraction (or terminated continued fraction), the iteration/recursion is terminated after finitely many steps by using an integer in lieu of another continued fraction. In contrast, an infinite continued fraction is an infinite expression. In either case, all integers in the sequence, other than the first, must be positive. The integers a i {\\displaystyle a_{i}} are called the coefficients or terms of the continued fraction.[2]","image":"0bc77764b2e74e64a63341054fa90f3e07db275f.svg","url":"Continued_fraction"}
