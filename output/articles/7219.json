{"title":"Hilbert's eighth problem","summary":"Hilbert's eighth problem is one of David Hilbert's list of open mathematical problems posed in 1900. It concerns number theory, and in particular the Riemann hypothesis,[1] although it is also concerned with the Goldbach Conjecture. The problem as stated asked for more work on the distribution of primes and generalizations of Riemann hypothesis to other rings where prime ideals take the place of primes.","image":"Riemann_zeta_function_absolute_value.png.webp","url":"Hilbert's_eighth_problem"}
