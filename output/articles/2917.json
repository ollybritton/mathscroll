{"title":"Commutation matrix","summary":"In mathematics, especially in linear algebra and matrix theory, the commutation matrix is used for transforming the vectorized form of a matrix into the vectorized form of its transpose. Specifically, the commutation matrix K(m,n) is the nm × mn matrix which, for any m × n matrix A, transforms vec(A) into vec(AT):","image":"5539b06d5a44e39b44bd7fe46618c2754e2c7799.svg","url":"Commutation_matrix"}
