{"title":"Resultant","summary":"In mathematics, the resultant of two polynomials is a polynomial expression of their coefficients that is equal to zero if and only if the polynomials have a common root (possibly in a field extension), or, equivalently, a common factor (over their field of coefficients). In some older texts, the resultant is also called the eliminant.[1]","image":"efc469f233978b8095cd6f7fe90f39d025af4204.svg","url":"Resultant"}
