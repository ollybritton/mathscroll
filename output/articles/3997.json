{"title":"Desargues graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Desargues graph is a distance-transitive, cubic graph with 20 vertices and 30 edges.[1] It is named after Girard Desargues, arises from several different combinatorial constructions, has a high level of symmetry, is the only known non-planar cubic partial cube, and has been applied in chemical databases.","image":"DesarguesGraph.svg.png.webp","url":"Desargues_graph"}
