{"title":"Kontsevich quantization formula","summary":"In mathematics, the Kontsevich quantization formula describes how to construct a generalized â˜…-product operator algebra from a given arbitrary finite-dimensional Poisson manifold. This operator algebra amounts to the deformation quantization of the corresponding Poisson algebra. It is due to Maxim Kontsevich.[1][2]","image":"bd316a21eeb5079a850f223b1d096a06bfa788c0.svg","url":"Kontsevich_quantization_formula"}
