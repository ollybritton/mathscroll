{"title":"Parallel all-pairs shortest path algorithm","summary":"A central problem in algorithmic graph theory is the shortest path problem. Hereby, the problem of finding the shortest path between every pair of nodes is known as all-pair-shortest-paths (APSP) problem. As sequential algorithms for this problem often yield long runtimes, parallelization has shown to be beneficial in this field. In this article two efficient algorithms solving this problem are introduced.","image":"764e1a915498876757761c008c306eb88edae72e.svg","url":"Parallel_all-pairs_shortest_path_algorithm"}
