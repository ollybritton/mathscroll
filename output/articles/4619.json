{"title":"Edmonds' algorithm","summary":"In graph theory, Edmonds' algorithm or Chuâ€“Liu/Edmonds' algorithm is an algorithm for finding a spanning arborescence of minimum weight (sometimes called an optimum branching). It is the directed analog of the minimum spanning tree problem. The algorithm was proposed independently first by Yoeng-Jin Chu and Tseng-Hong Liu (1965) and then by Jack Edmonds (1967).","image":"a7ca2a9d9ff71aa087928251fd2a8f69f6100971.svg","url":"Edmonds'_algorithm"}
