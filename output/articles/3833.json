{"title":"De Rham cohomology","summary":"In mathematics, de Rham cohomology (named after Georges de Rham) is a tool belonging both to algebraic topology and to differential topology, capable of expressing basic topological information about smooth manifolds in a form particularly adapted to computation and the concrete representation of cohomology classes. It is a cohomology theory based on the existence of differential forms with prescribed properties.","image":"Irrotationalfield.svg.png.webp","url":"De_Rham_cohomology"}
