{"title":"Unit disk graph","summary":"In geometric graph theory, a unit disk graph is the intersection graph of a family of unit disks in the Euclidean plane. That is, it is a graph with one vertex for each disk in the family, and with an edge between two vertices whenever the corresponding vertices lie within a unit distance of each other.","image":"Unit_disk_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Unit_disk_graph"}
