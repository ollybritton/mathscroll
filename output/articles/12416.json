{"title":"Postnikov system","summary":"In homotopy theory, a branch of algebraic topology, a Postnikov system (or Postnikov tower) is a way of decomposing a topological space's homotopy groups using an inverse system of topological spaces whose homotopy type at degree k {\\displaystyle k} agrees with the truncated homotopy type of the original space X {\\displaystyle X} . Postnikov systems were introduced by, and are named after, Mikhail Postnikov.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Postnikov_system"}
