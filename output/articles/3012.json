{"title":"Complex dimension","summary":"In mathematics, complex dimension usually refers to the dimension of a complex manifold or a complex algebraic variety.[1] These are spaces in which the local neighborhoods of points (or of non-singular points in the case of a variety) are modeled on a Cartesian product of the form C d {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{d}} for some d {\\displaystyle d} , and the complex dimension is the exponent d {\\displaystyle d} in this product. Because C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } can in turn be modeled by R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} , a space with complex dimension d {\\displaystyle d} will have real dimension 2 d {\\displaystyle 2d} .[2] That is, a smooth manifold of complex dimension d {\\displaystyle d} has real dimension 2 d {\\displaystyle 2d} ; and a complex algebraic variety of complex dimension d {\\displaystyle d} , away from any singular point, will also be a smooth manifold of real dimension 2 d {\\displaystyle 2d} .","image":"dcc165f5f6c2360e365b6693209c45fe805a0781.svg","url":"Complex_dimension"}
