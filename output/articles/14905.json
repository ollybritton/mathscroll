{"title":"Stable vector bundle","summary":"In mathematics, a stable vector bundle is a (holomorphic or algebraic) vector bundle that is stable in the sense of geometric invariant theory. Any holomorphic vector bundle may be built from stable ones using Harderâ€“Narasimhan filtration. Stable bundles were defined by David Mumford in Mumford (1963) and later built upon by David Gieseker, Fedor Bogomolov, Thomas Bridgeland and many others.","image":"58363ac18080a6c4fc2973a705249d71e810ac6e.svg","url":"Stable_vector_bundle"}
