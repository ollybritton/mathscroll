{"title":"Hedgehog (geometry)","summary":"In differential geometry, a hedgehog or plane hedgehog is a type of plane curve, the envelope of a family of lines determined by a support function. More intuitively, sufficiently well-behaved hedgehogs are plane curves with one tangent line in each oriented direction. A projective hedgehog is a restricted type of hedgehog, defined from an anti-symmetric support function, and (again when sufficiently well-behaved) forms a curve with one tangent line in each direction, regardless of orientation.","image":"Astroid_as_envelope.png.webp","url":"Hedgehog_(geometry)"}
