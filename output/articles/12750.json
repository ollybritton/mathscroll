{"title":"Pumping lemma for regular languages","summary":"In the theory of formal languages, the pumping lemma for regular languages is a lemma that describes an essential property of all regular languages. Informally, it says that all sufficiently long strings in a regular language may be pumped—that is, have a middle section of the string repeated an arbitrary number of times—to produce a new string that is also part of the language.","image":"103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8.svg","url":"Pumping_lemma_for_regular_languages"}
