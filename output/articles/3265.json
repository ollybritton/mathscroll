{"title":"Constant-recursive sequence","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical computer science, a constant-recursive sequence is an infinite sequence of numbers where each number in the sequence is equal to a fixed linear combination of one or more of its immediate predecessors. A constant-recursive sequence is also known as a linear recurrence sequence, linear-recursive sequence, linear-recurrent sequence, a C-finite sequence,[1] or a solution to a linear recurrence with constant coefficients.","image":"Fibonacci_sequence.jpg.webp","url":"Constant-recursive_sequence"}
