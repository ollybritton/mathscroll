{"title":"Unisolvent point set","summary":"In approximation theory, a finite collection of points X ⊂ R n {\\displaystyle X\\subset R^{n}} is often called unisolvent for a space W {\\displaystyle W} if any element w ∈ W {\\displaystyle w\\in W} is uniquely determined by its values on X {\\displaystyle X} . X {\\displaystyle X} is unisolvent for Π n m {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{n}^{m}} (polynomials in n variables of degree at most m) if there exists a unique polynomial in Π n m {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{n}^{m}} of lowest possible degree which interpolates the data X {\\displaystyle X} .","image":"f16ff7044800856fd1fbe393cd6c03d1fb34cbcb.svg","url":"Unisolvent_point_set"}
