{"title":"Kahan summation algorithm","summary":"In numerical analysis, the Kahan summation algorithm, also known as compensated summation,[1] significantly reduces the numerical error in the total obtained by adding a sequence of finite-precision floating-point numbers, compared to the obvious approach. This is done by keeping a separate running compensation (a variable to accumulate small errors), in effect extending the precision of the sum by the precision of the compensation variable.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Kahan_summation_algorithm"}
