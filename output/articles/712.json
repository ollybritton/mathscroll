{"title":"Amenable Banach algebra","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in functional analysis, a Banach algebra, A,  is amenable if all bounded derivations from A into dual Banach A-bimodules are inner (that is of the form a ↦ a . x − x . a {\\displaystyle a\\mapsto a.x-x.a} for some x {\\displaystyle x} in the dual module).","image":"94eb1d96b2b510a4ca3c70368ac171668ad6eab3.svg","url":"Amenable_Banach_algebra"}
