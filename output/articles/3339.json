{"title":"Contorsion tensor","summary":"The contorsion tensor in differential geometry is the difference between a connection with and without torsion in it.  It commonly appears in the study of spin connections. Thus, for example, a vielbein together with a spin connection, when subject to the condition of vanishing torsion, gives a description of Einstein gravity. For supersymmetry, the same constraint, of vanishing torsion, gives (the field equations of) 11-dimensional supergravity.[1] That is, the contorsion tensor, along with the connection, becomes one of the dynamical objects of the theory, demoting the metric to a secondary, derived role.","image":"e33891dbbfbaaf4e15f64040da551586bb3489be.svg","url":"Contorsion_tensor"}
