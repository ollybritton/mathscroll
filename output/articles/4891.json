{"title":"Equal incircles theorem","summary":"In geometry, the equal incircles theorem derives from a Japanese Sangaku, and pertains to the following construction: a series of rays are drawn from a given point to a given line such that the inscribed circles of the triangles formed by adjacent rays and the base line are equal. In the illustration the equal blue circles define the spacing between the rays, as described.","image":"Incircles.JPG.webp","url":"Equal_incircles_theorem"}
