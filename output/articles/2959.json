{"title":"Compass equivalence theorem","summary":"In geometry, the compass equivalence theorem is an important statement in compass and straightedge constructions. The tool advocated by Plato in these constructions is a divider or collapsing compass, that is, a compass that \"collapses\" whenever it is lifted from a page, so that it may not be directly used to transfer distances. The modern compass with its fixable aperture can be used to transfer distances directly and so appears to be a more powerful instrument. However, the compass equivalence theorem states that any construction via a \"modern compass\" may be attained with a collapsing compass. This can be shown by establishing that with a collapsing compass, given a circle in the plane, it is possible to construct another circle of equal radius, centered at any given point on the plane. This theorem is Proposition II of Book I of Euclid's Elements. The proof of this theorem has had a chequered history.[1]","image":"Euclid2.svg.png.webp","url":"Compass_equivalence_theorem"}
