{"title":"Wagner's theorem","summary":"In graph theory, Wagner's theorem is a mathematical forbidden graph characterization of planar graphs, named after Klaus Wagner, stating that a finite graph is planar if and only if its minors include neither K5  (the complete graph on five vertices) nor K3,3 (the utility graph, a complete bipartite graph on six vertices). This was one of the earliest results in the theory of graph minors and can be seen as a forerunner of the Robertsonâ€“Seymour theorem.","image":"Petersen_Wagner_minors.svg.png.webp","url":"Wagner's_theorem"}
