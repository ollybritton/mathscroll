{"title":"Double (manifold)","summary":"In the subject of manifold theory in mathematics, if M {\\displaystyle M} is a manifold with boundary, its double is obtained by gluing two copies of M {\\displaystyle M} together along their common boundary.[1] Precisely, the double is M × { 0 , 1 } / ∼ {\\displaystyle M\\times \\{0,1\\}/\\sim } where ( x , 0 ) ∼ ( x , 1 ) {\\displaystyle (x,0)\\sim (x,1)} for all x ∈ ∂ M {\\displaystyle x\\in \\partial M} .","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Double_(manifold)"}
