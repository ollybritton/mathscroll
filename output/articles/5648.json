{"title":"Fractional wavelet transform","summary":"Fractional wavelet transform (FRWT) is a generalization of the classical wavelet transform (WT). This transform is proposed in order to rectify the limitations of the WT and the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT). The FRWT inherits the advantages of multiresolution analysis of the WT and has the capability of signal representations in the fractional domain which is similar to the FRFT.","image":"84f0f8855bbb62b95520e5198b5d938338d49c17.svg","url":"Fractional_wavelet_transform"}
