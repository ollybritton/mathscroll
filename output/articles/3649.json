{"title":"Curvature invariant","summary":"In Riemannian geometry and pseudo-Riemannian geometry, curvature invariants are scalar quantities constructed from tensors that represent curvature. These tensors are usually the Riemann tensor, the Weyl tensor, the Ricci tensor and tensors formed from these by the operations of taking dual contractions and covariant differentiations.","image":"0aa1f1ca9bee9c2b40a7bafb1f5fae996d5c7d8a.svg","url":"Curvature_invariant"}
