{"title":"Spanier–Whitehead duality","summary":"In mathematics, Spanier–Whitehead duality is a duality theory in homotopy theory, based on a geometrical idea that a topological space X may be considered as dual to its complement in the n-sphere, where n is large enough. Its origins lie in Alexander duality theory, in homology theory, concerning complements in manifolds. The theory is also referred to as S-duality, but this can now cause possible confusion with the S-duality of string theory. It is named for Edwin Spanier and J. H. C. Whitehead, who developed it in papers from 1955.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Spanier–Whitehead_duality"}
