{"title":"λ-ring","summary":"In algebra, a λ-ring or lambda ring is a commutative ring together with some operations λn on it that behave like the exterior powers of vector spaces. Many rings considered in K-theory carry a natural λ-ring structure. λ-rings also provide a powerful formalism for studying an action of the symmetric functions on the ring of polynomials, recovering and extending many classical results (Lascoux (2003)).","image":"86aece1676f74fb8ee42eb20d48871f1f8510e71.svg","url":"Λ-ring"}
