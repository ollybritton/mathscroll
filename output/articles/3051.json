{"title":"Compound Poisson process","summary":"A compound Poisson process is a continuous-time (random) stochastic process with jumps. The jumps arrive randomly according to a Poisson process and the size of the jumps is also random, with a specified probability distribution. A compound Poisson process, parameterised by a rate λ > 0 {\\displaystyle \\lambda >0} and jump size distribution G, is a process { Y ( t ) : t ≥ 0 } {\\displaystyle \\{\\,Y(t):t\\geq 0\\,\\}} given by","image":"eea25afc0351140f919cf791c49c1964b8b081de.svg","url":"Compound_Poisson_process"}
