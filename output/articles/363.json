{"title":"Additive identity","summary":"In mathematics, the additive identity of a set that is equipped with the operation of addition is an element which, when added to any element x in the set, yields x. One of the most familiar additive identities is the number 0 from elementary mathematics, but additive identities occur in other mathematical structures where addition is defined, such as in groups and rings.","image":"94a1282862a8d54ebe8865918542961bfb242d53.svg","url":"Additive_identity"}
