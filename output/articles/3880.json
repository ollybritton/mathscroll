{"title":"Deficient number","summary":"In number theory, a deficient number or defective number is a number n for which the sum of divisors of n is less than 2n.  Equivalently, it is a number for which the sum of proper divisors (or aliquot sum) is less than n.  For example, the proper divisors of 8 are 1, 2, and 4, and their sum is less than 8, so 8 is deficient.","image":"Deficient_number_Cuisenaire_rods_8.png.webp","url":"Deficient_number"}
