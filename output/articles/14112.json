{"title":"Semi-reflexive space","summary":"In the area of mathematics known as functional analysis, a semi-reflexive space is a locally convex topological vector space (TVS) X such that the canonical evaluation map from X into its bidual (which is the strong dual of the strong dual of X) is bijective. If this map is also an isomorphism of TVSs then it is called reflexive.","image":"573f72afae7df709959ab1a58cd643743466a187.svg","url":"Semi-reflexive_space"}
