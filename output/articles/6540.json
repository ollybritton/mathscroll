{"title":"Great rhombic triacontahedron","summary":"In geometry, the great rhombic triacontahedron is a nonconvex isohedral, isotoxal polyhedron. It is the dual of the great icosidodecahedron (U54). Like the convex rhombic triacontahedron it has 30 rhombic faces, 60 edges and 32 vertices (also 20 on 3-fold and 12 on 5-fold axes).","image":"DU54_great_rhombic_triacontahedron.png.webp","url":"Great_rhombic_triacontahedron"}
