{"title":"Kernel (algebra)","summary":"In algebra, the kernel of a homomorphism (function that preserves the structure) is generally the inverse image of 0 (except for groups whose operation is denoted multiplicatively, where the kernel is the inverse image of 1). An important special case is the kernel of a linear map. The kernel of a matrix, also called the null space, is the kernel of the linear map defined by the matrix.","image":"f591fea0debd4e264970291e6a9130938d80b330.svg","url":"Kernel_(algebra)"}
