{"title":"Conformal radius","summary":"In mathematics, the conformal radius is a way to measure the size of a simply connected planar domain D viewed from a point z in it. As opposed to notions using Euclidean distance (say, the radius of the largest inscribed disk with center z), this notion is well-suited to use in complex analysis, in particular in conformal maps and conformal geometry.","image":"e5901d390e5b0a69e1428bcf647baa05b0f8c016.svg","url":"Conformal_radius"}
