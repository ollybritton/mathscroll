{"title":"Circle packing in an equilateral triangle","summary":"Circle packing in an equilateral triangle is a packing problem in discrete mathematics where the objective is to pack n unit circles into the smallest possible equilateral triangle.  Optimal solutions are known for n < 13 and for any triangular number of circles, and conjectures are available for n < 28.[1][2][3]","image":"2cdf91246d2cd0e905a1aaf5b4b85cfc5a5879cd.svg","url":"Circle_packing_in_an_equilateral_triangle"}
