{"title":"Iterated integral","summary":"In multivariable calculus, an iterated integral is the result of applying integrals to a function of more than one variable (for example f ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle f(x,y)} or f ( x , y , z ) {\\displaystyle f(x,y,z)} ) in a way that each of the integrals considers some of the variables as given constants. For example, the function f ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle f(x,y)} , if y {\\displaystyle y} is considered a given parameter, can be integrated with respect to x {\\displaystyle x} , âˆ« f ( x , y ) d x {\\textstyle \\int f(x,y)\\,dx} . The result is a function of y {\\displaystyle y} and therefore its integral can be considered. If this is done, the result is the iterated integral","image":"29473ed0c4e838ac9dbe074535e507166c0e9101.svg","url":"Iterated_integral"}
