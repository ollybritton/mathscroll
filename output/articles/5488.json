{"title":"Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution is a generalization of the hypergeometric distribution where sampling probabilities are modified by weight factors. It can also be defined as the conditional distribution of two or more binomially distributed variables dependent upon their fixed sum.","image":"FishersNoncentralHypergeometric1.png.webp","url":"Fisher's_noncentral_hypergeometric_distribution"}
