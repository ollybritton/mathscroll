{"title":"Heun function","summary":"In mathematics, the local Heun function H ℓ ( a , q ; α , β , γ , δ ; z ) {\\displaystyle H\\ell (a,q;\\alpha ,\\beta ,\\gamma ,\\delta ;z)} (Karl L. W. Heun 1889) is the solution of Heun's differential equation that is holomorphic and 1 at the singular point z = 0. The local Heun function is called a Heun function, denoted Hf, if it is also regular at z = 1, and is called  a Heun polynomial, denoted Hp,  if it is regular at all three finite singular points z = 0, 1, a.","image":"16f7f3dc21a12f186951cc2dd7b56b142250de25.svg","url":"Heun_function"}
