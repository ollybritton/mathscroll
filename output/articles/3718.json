{"title":"Cylindrical harmonics","summary":"In mathematics, the cylindrical harmonics are a set of linearly independent functions that are solutions to Laplace's differential equation, ∇ 2 V = 0 {\\displaystyle \\nabla ^{2}V=0} , expressed in cylindrical coordinates, ρ (radial coordinate), φ (polar angle), and z (height). Each function Vn(k) is the product of three terms, each depending on one coordinate alone. The ρ-dependent term is given by Bessel functions (which occasionally are also called cylindrical harmonics).","image":"9ff020357f18502f7c5337e57eb075267fdf4350.svg","url":"Cylindrical_harmonics"}
