{"title":"Exeter point","summary":"In geometry, the Exeter point is a special point associated with a plane triangle. The Exeter point is a triangle center  and is designated as  the center X(22)[1] in Clark Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. This was discovered in a computers-in-mathematics workshop at Phillips Exeter Academy in 1986.[2] This is one of the recent triangle centers, unlike the classical triangle centers like centroid, incenter, and Steiner point.[3]","image":"Exeter_point.svg.png.webp","url":"Exeter_point"}
