{"title":"Schur product theorem","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, the Schur product theorem states that the Hadamard product of two positive definite matrices is also a positive definite matrix. The result is named after Issai Schur[1] (Schur 1911, p. 14, Theorem VII) (note that Schur signed as J. Schur in Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik.[2][3])","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Schur_product_theorem"}
