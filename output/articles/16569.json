{"title":"Veronese surface","summary":"In mathematics, the Veronese surface is an algebraic surface in five-dimensional projective space, and is realized by the Veronese embedding, the embedding of the projective plane given by the complete linear system of conics. It is named after Giuseppe Veronese (1854â€“1917). Its generalization to higher dimension is known as the Veronese variety.","image":"f4cc1bf667eac1124d2b78362606752797fd9777.svg","url":"Veronese_surface"}
