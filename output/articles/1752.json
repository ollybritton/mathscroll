{"title":"Blind deconvolution","summary":"In electrical engineering and applied mathematics, blind deconvolution is deconvolution without explicit knowledge of the impulse response function used in the convolution. This is usually achieved by making appropriate assumptions of the input to estimate the impulse response by analyzing the output. Blind deconvolution is not solvable without making assumptions on input and impulse response. Most of the algorithms to solve this problem  are based on assumption that both input and impulse response live in respective  known subspaces. However,  blind deconvolution remains a very challenging non-convex optimization problem even with this assumption.","image":"Blind_deconvolution_illustration.png.webp","url":"Blind_deconvolution"}
