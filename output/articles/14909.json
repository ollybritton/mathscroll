{"title":"Stack (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics a stack or 2-sheaf is, roughly speaking, a sheaf that takes values in categories rather than sets. Stacks are used to formalise some of the main constructions of descent theory, and to construct fine moduli stacks when fine moduli spaces do not exist.","image":"86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455.svg","url":"Stack_(mathematics)"}
