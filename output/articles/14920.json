{"title":"Standard deviation line","summary":"In statistics, the Standard deviation line (or SD line) marks points on a scatter diagram that are an equal number of standard deviations away from the average in each dimension. For example, in a 2-dimensional scatter diagram with variables x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} , points that are 1 standard deviation away from the mean of x {\\displaystyle x} and also 1 standard deviation away from the mean of y {\\displaystyle y} are on the SD line.[1] The SD line is a useful visual tool since points in a scatter diagram tend to cluster around it,[1] more or less tightly depending on their correlation.","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Standard_deviation_line"}
