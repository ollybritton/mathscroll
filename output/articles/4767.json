{"title":"Ellsberg paradox","summary":"In decision theory, the Ellsberg paradox (or Ellsberg's paradox) is a paradox in which people's decisions are inconsistent with subjective expected utility theory. Daniel Ellsberg popularized the paradox in his 1961 paper, “Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms”.[1] John Maynard Keynes published a version of the paradox in 1921.[2] It is generally taken to be evidence of ambiguity aversion, in which a person tends to prefer choices with quantifiable risks over those with unknown, incalculable risks.","image":"Daniel_Ellsberg_2006.jpg.webp","url":"Ellsberg_paradox"}
