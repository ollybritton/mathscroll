{"title":"Torsion sheaf","summary":"In mathematics, a torsion sheaf is a sheaf of abelian groups F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} on a site for which, for every object U, the space of sections Γ ( U , F ) {\\displaystyle \\Gamma (U,{\\mathcal {F}})} is a torsion abelian group. Similarly, for a prime number p, we say a sheaf F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} is p-torsion if every section over any object is killed by a power of p.","image":"205d4b91000d9dcf1a5bbabdfa6a8395fa60b676.svg","url":"Torsion_sheaf"}
