{"title":"Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation","summary":"In mathematics, the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation (also called the KS equation or flame equation) is a fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation. It is named after Yoshiki Kuramoto and Gregory Sivashinsky, who derived the equation in the late 1970s to model the diffusive–thermal instabilities in a laminar flame front.[1][2][3] The Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation is known for its chaotic behavior.[4][5]","image":"Kuramoto–Sivashinsky_spatiotemporal_evolution.png.webp","url":"Kuramoto–Sivashinsky_equation"}
