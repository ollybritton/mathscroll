{"title":"Cohen–Macaulay ring","summary":"In mathematics, a Cohen–Macaulay ring is a commutative ring with some of the algebro-geometric properties of a smooth variety, such as local equidimensionality. Under mild assumptions, a local ring is Cohen–Macaulay exactly when it is a finitely generated free module over a regular local subring. Cohen–Macaulay rings play a central role in commutative algebra: they form a very broad class, and yet they are well understood in many ways.","image":"52455de334c53aa167e25542043797c82763dae5.svg","url":"Cohen–Macaulay_ring"}
