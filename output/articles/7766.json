{"title":"Infinite-order square tiling","summary":"In geometry, the infinite-order square tiling is a regular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It has Schläfli symbol of {4,∞}. All vertices are ideal, located at \"infinity\", seen on the boundary of the Poincaré hyperbolic disk projection.","image":"H2_tiling_24i-4.png.webp","url":"Infinite-order_square_tiling"}
