{"title":"Tetrahedral-dodecahedral honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the tetrahedral-dodecahedral honeycomb is a compact uniform honeycomb, constructed from dodecahedron, tetrahedron, and icosidodecahedron cells, in a rhombitetratetrahedron vertex figure. It has a single-ring Coxeter diagram, , and is named by its two regular cells.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Tetrahedral-dodecahedral_honeycomb"}
