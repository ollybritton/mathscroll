{"title":"Large sieve","summary":"The large sieve is a method (or family of methods and related ideas) in analytic number theory. It is a type of sieve where up to half of all residue classes of numbers are removed, as opposed to small sieves such as the Selberg sieve wherein only a few residue classes are removed. The method has been further heightened by the larger sieve which removes arbitrarily many residue classes.[1]","image":"eb0510490104a86598610c6386ab7e5f9102e862.svg","url":"Large_sieve"}
