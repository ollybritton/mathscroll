{"title":"Sheaf of spectra","summary":"In algebraic topology, a presheaf of spectra on a topological space X is a contravariant functor from the category of open subsets of X, where morphisms are inclusions, to the good category of commutative ring spectra. A theorem of Jardine says that such presheaves form a simplicial model category, where F →G is a weak equivalence if the induced map of homotopy sheaves π ∗ F → π ∗ G {\\displaystyle \\pi _{*}F\\to \\pi _{*}G} is an isomorphism. A sheaf of spectra is then a fibrant/cofibrant object in that category.","image":"43e8493c8e9e4a7daebac879b01b37e3447c4c8b.svg","url":"Sheaf_of_spectra"}
