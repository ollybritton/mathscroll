{"title":"Gömböc","summary":"The gömböc (Hungarian: [ˈɡømbøt͡s] GUHM-buhts) is the first known physical example of a class of convex three-dimensional homogeneous bodies, called mono-monostatic,  which, when resting on a flat surface have just one stable and one unstable point of equilibrium. The existence of this class was conjectured by the Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold in 1995 and proven in 2006 by the Hungarian scientists Gábor Domokos and Péter Várkonyi by constructing at first a mathematical example and subsequently a physical example.  Mono-monostatic shapes exist in countless varieties, most of which are close to a sphere, with a stringent shape tolerance (about one part in a thousand).","image":"Gömböc.gif","url":"Gömböc"}
