{"title":"Universally measurable set","summary":"In mathematics, a subset A {\\displaystyle A} of a Polish space X {\\displaystyle X} is universally measurable if it is measurable with respect to every complete probability measure on X {\\displaystyle X} that measures all Borel subsets of X {\\displaystyle X} .  In particular, a universally measurable set of reals is necessarily Lebesgue measurable (see § Finiteness condition below).","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Universally_measurable_set"}
