{"title":"Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes","summary":"Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes (literal translation: Analysis of the infinitely small to understand curves), 1696, is the first textbook published on the infinitesimal calculus of Leibniz. It was written by the French mathematician Guillaume de l'Hôpital, and treated only the subject of differential calculus.  Two volumes treating the differential and integral calculus, respectively, had been authored by Johann Bernoulli in 1691–1692, and the latter was published in 1724 to become the first published textbook on the integral calculus.","image":"L'Hospital_-_Analyse_des_infiniment_petits_pour_l'intelligence_des_lignes_courbes%2C_1715_-_1425244.jpg.webp","url":"Analyse_des_Infiniment_Petits_pour_l'Intelligence_des_Lignes_Courbes"}
