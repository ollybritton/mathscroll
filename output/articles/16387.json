{"title":"Unique games conjecture","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the unique games conjecture (often referred to as UGC) is a conjecture made by Subhash Khot in 2002.[1][2][3] The conjecture postulates that the problem of determining the approximate value of a certain type of game, known as a unique game, has NP-hard computational complexity.  It has broad applications in the theory of hardness of approximation. If the unique games conjecture is true and P ≠ NP,[4] then for many important problems it is not only impossible to get an exact solution in polynomial time (as postulated by the P versus NP problem), but also impossible to get a good polynomial-time approximation. The problems for which such an inapproximability result would hold include constraint satisfaction problems, which crop up in a wide variety of disciplines.","image":"Unique_label_cover_yes-instance.svg.png.webp","url":"Unique_games_conjecture"}
