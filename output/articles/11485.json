{"title":"Order-5 120-cell honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 4-space, the order-5 120-cell honeycomb is one of five compact regular space-filling tessellations (or honeycombs). With Schl√§fli symbol {5,3,3,5}, it has five 120-cells around each face. It is self-dual. It also has 600 120-cells around each vertex.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Order-5_120-cell_honeycomb"}
