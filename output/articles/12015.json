{"title":"Perfect ring","summary":"In the area of abstract algebra known as ring theory, a left perfect ring is a type of ring in which all left modules have projective covers. The right case is defined by analogy, and the condition is not left-right symmetric; that is, there exist rings which are perfect on one side but not the other. Perfect rings were introduced in Bass's book.[1]","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"Perfect_ring"}
