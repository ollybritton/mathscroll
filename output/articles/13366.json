{"title":"Relativistic system (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a  non-autonomous system of ordinary differential equations is defined to be a dynamic equation on a smooth fiber bundle Q â†’ R {\\displaystyle Q\\to \\mathbb {R} } over R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } . For instance, this is the case of non-relativistic non-autonomous mechanics, but not relativistic mechanics. To describe relativistic mechanics, one should consider a system of ordinary differential equations on a smooth manifold Q {\\displaystyle Q} whose fibration over R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } is not fixed. Such a system admits transformations of a coordinate t {\\displaystyle t} on R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } depending on other coordinates on Q {\\displaystyle Q} . Therefore, it is called the relativistic system. In particular, Special Relativity on the Minkowski space Q = R 4 {\\displaystyle Q=\\mathbb {R} ^{4}} is of this type.","image":"a46144cc91a453df7fadc4e92a8cd9d40f5b02e0.svg","url":"Relativistic_system_(mathematics)"}
