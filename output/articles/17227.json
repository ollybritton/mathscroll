{"title":"Āryabhaṭa's sine table","summary":"Āryabhata's sine table is a set of twenty-four numbers  given in the astronomical treatise Āryabhatiya composed by the fifth century  Indian mathematician and astronomer  Āryabhata (476–550 CE),  for the computation of the half-chords of a certain set of arcs of a circle. The set of numbers appears in verse 12 in Chapter 1 Dasagitika of Aryabhatiya.[1] It is not a table in the modern sense of a mathematical table; that is, it is not a set of numbers arranged into rows and columns.[2] [3][4] Āryabhaṭa's table is also not a set of values of the trigonometric sine function in a conventional sense; it is a table of the first differences of the values of trigonometric sines expressed in arcminutes, and because of this the table is also referred to as Āryabhaṭa's table of sine-differences.[5][6]","image":"Arc_and_chord.svg.png.webp","url":"Āryabhaṭa's_sine_table"}
