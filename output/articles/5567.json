{"title":"Forbidden subgraph problem","summary":"In extremal graph theory, the forbidden subgraph problem is the following problem: given a graph G {\\displaystyle G} , find the maximal number of edges ex ‚Å° ( n , G ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {ex} (n,G)} an n {\\displaystyle n} -vertex graph can have such that it does not have a subgraph isomorphic to G {\\displaystyle G} . In this context, G {\\displaystyle G} is called a forbidden subgraph.[1]","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Forbidden_subgraph_problem"}
