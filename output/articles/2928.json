{"title":"Commuting matrices","summary":"In linear algebra, two matrices A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} are said to commute if A B = B A {\\displaystyle AB=BA} , or equivalently if their commutator [ A , B ] = A B − B A {\\displaystyle [A,B]=AB-BA} is zero. A set of matrices A 1 , … , A k {\\displaystyle A_{1},\\ldots ,A_{k}} is said to commute if they commute pairwise, meaning that every pair of matrices in the set commute with each other.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Commuting_matrices"}
