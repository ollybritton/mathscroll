{"title":"Parameterized complexity","summary":"In computer science, parameterized complexity is a branch of computational complexity theory that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty with respect to multiple parameters of the input or output. The complexity of a problem is then measured as a function of those parameters. This allows the classification of NP-hard problems on a finer scale than in the classical setting, where the complexity of a problem is only measured as a function of the number of bits in the input. The first systematic work on parameterized complexity was done by Downey & Fellows (1999).","image":"fa29e477ca76afa750a88a2204fabaaae644d7af.svg","url":"Parameterized_complexity"}
