{"title":"Aleksandrov–Rassias problem","summary":"The theory of isometries in the framework of Banach spaces has its beginning in a paper by Stanisław Mazur and Stanisław M. Ulam in 1932.[1] They proved the Mazur–Ulam theorem stating that every isometry of a normed real linear space onto a normed real linear space is a linear mapping up to translation. In 1970, Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov asked whether the existence of a single conservative distance for a mapping implies that it is an isometry. Themistocles M. Rassias posed the following problem:","image":"606564552d85902c018f8169b76a488b4918f27e.svg","url":"Aleksandrov–Rassias_problem"}
