{"title":"Order-5 dodecahedral honeycomb","summary":"In hyperbolic geometry, the order-5 dodecahedral honeycomb is one of four compact regular space-filling tessellations (or honeycombs) in hyperbolic 3-space. With Schl√§fli symbol {5,3,5}, it has five dodecahedral cells around each edge, and each vertex is surrounded by twenty dodecahedra. Its vertex figure is an icosahedron.","image":"H3_535_CC_center.png.webp","url":"Order-5_dodecahedral_honeycomb"}
