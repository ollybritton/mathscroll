{"title":"Twistor space","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical physics (especially twistor theory), twistor space is the complex vector space of solutions of the twistor equation ∇ A ′ ( A Ω B ) = 0 {\\displaystyle \\nabla _{A'}^{(A}\\Omega _{^{}}^{B)}=0} . It was described in the 1960s by Roger Penrose and Malcolm MacCallum.[1] According to Andrew Hodges, twistor space is useful for conceptualizing the way photons travel through space, using four complex numbers. He also posits that twistor space may aid in understanding the asymmetry of the weak nuclear force.[2]","image":"7dcafd3401b294334d2b2d857ad1384d6521aadc.svg","url":"Twistor_space"}
