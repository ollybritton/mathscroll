{"title":"Novikov's condition","summary":"In probability theory, Novikov's condition is the sufficient condition for a stochastic process which takes the form of the Radon–Nikodym derivative in Girsanov's theorem to be a martingale. If satisfied together with other conditions, Girsanov's theorem may be applied to a Brownian motion stochastic process to change from the original measure to the new measure defined by the Radon–Nikodym derivative.","image":"e8bf8e90ff90bc7fc945d41ad5e44e37f231926d.svg","url":"Novikov's_condition"}
