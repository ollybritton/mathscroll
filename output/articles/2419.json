{"title":"Centered icosahedral number","summary":"The centered icosahedral numbers and cuboctahedral numbers are two different names for the same sequence of numbers, describing two different representations for these numbers as three-dimensional figurate numbers. As centered icosahedral numbers, they are centered numbers representing points arranged in the shape of a regular icosahedron. As cuboctahedral numbers, they represent points arranged in the shape of a cuboctahedron, and are a magic number for the face-centered cubic lattice. The centered icosahedral number for a specific n {\\displaystyle n} is given by","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Centered_icosahedral_number"}
