{"title":"Bourbaki–Witt theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Bourbaki–Witt theorem in order theory, named after Nicolas Bourbaki and Ernst Witt, is a basic fixed point theorem for partially ordered sets. It states that if X is a non-empty chain complete poset, and f : X → X {\\displaystyle f:X\\to X} such that f ( x ) ≥ x {\\displaystyle f(x)\\geq x} for all x , {\\displaystyle x,} then f has a fixed point. Such a function f is called inflationary or progressive.","image":"672b7e48a9c7c9f7b0be9a75555e0dbd87c64aaa.svg","url":"Bourbaki–Witt_theorem"}
