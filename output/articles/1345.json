{"title":"Barycentric coordinate system","summary":"In geometry, a barycentric coordinate system is a coordinate system in which the location of a point is specified by reference to a simplex (a triangle for points in a plane, a tetrahedron for points in three-dimensional space, etc.). The barycentric coordinates of a point can be interpreted as masses placed at the vertices of the simplex, such that the point is the center of mass (or barycenter) of these masses. These masses can be zero or negative; they are all positive if and only if the point is inside the simplex.","image":"Barycentric_subdivision_of_a_3-simplex.png.webp","url":"Barycentric_coordinate_system"}
