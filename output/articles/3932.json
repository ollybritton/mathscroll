{"title":"Delta-ring","summary":"In mathematics, a non-empty collection of sets R {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {R}}} is called a Œ¥-ring (pronounced \"delta-ring\") if it is closed under union, relative complementation, and countable intersection. The name \"delta-ring\" originates from the German word for intersection, \"Durschnitt\", which is meant to highlight the ring's closure under countable intersection, in contrast to a ùúé-ring which is closed under countable unions.","image":"74532dc308c806964b832df0d0d73352195c2f2f.svg","url":"Delta-ring"}
