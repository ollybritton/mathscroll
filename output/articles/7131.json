{"title":"Hessenberg matrix","summary":"In linear algebra, a Hessenberg matrix is a special kind of square matrix, one that is \"almost\" triangular. To be exact, an upper Hessenberg matrix has zero entries below the first subdiagonal, and a lower Hessenberg matrix has zero entries above the first superdiagonal.[1] They are named after Karl Hessenberg.[2]","image":"59d2b4cb72e304526cf5b5887147729ea259da78.svg","url":"Hessenberg_matrix"}
