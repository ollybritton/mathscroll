{"title":"Capelli's identity","summary":"In mathematics, Capelli's identity, named after Alfredo Capelli (1887), is an analogue of the formula det(AB) = det(A) det(B), for certain matrices with noncommuting entries, related to the representation theory of the Lie algebra g l n {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {gl}}_{n}} . It can be used to relate an invariant ƒ to the invariant Ωƒ, where Ω is Cayley's Ω process.","image":"7074085f669b257cf21f2f443dd433888e2597b6.svg","url":"Capelli's_identity"}
