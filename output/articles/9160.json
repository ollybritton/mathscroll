{"title":"Legendre symbol","summary":"In number theory, the Legendre symbol is a multiplicative function with values 1, −1, 0 that is a quadratic character modulo an odd prime number p: its value at a (nonzero) quadratic residue mod p is 1 and at a non-quadratic residue (non-residue) is −1. Its value at zero is 0.","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Legendre_symbol"}
