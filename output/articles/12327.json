{"title":"Polyiamond","summary":"A polyiamond (also polyamond or simply iamond, or sometimes triangular polyomino[1]) is a polyform whose base form is an equilateral triangle. The word polyiamond is a back-formation from diamond, because this word is often used to describe the shape of a pair of equilateral triangles placed base to base, and the initial 'di-' looks like a Greek prefix meaning 'two-' (though diamond actually derives from Greek  ἀδάμας - also the basis for the word \"adamant\"). The name was suggested by recreational mathematics writer Thomas H. O'Beirne in New Scientist 1961 number 1, page 164.","image":"Commons-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Polyiamond"}
