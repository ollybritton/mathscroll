{"title":"Risk difference","summary":"The risk difference (RD), excess risk, or attributable risk is the difference between the risk of an outcome in the exposed group and the unexposed group. It is computed as I e − I u {\\displaystyle I_{e}-I_{u}} , where I e {\\displaystyle I_{e}} is the  incidence in the exposed group, and I u {\\displaystyle I_{u}} is the incidence in the unexposed group. If the risk of an outcome is increased by the exposure, the term absolute risk increase (ARI) is used, and computed as I e − I u {\\displaystyle I_{e}-I_{u}} . Equivalently, if the risk of an outcome is decreased by the exposure, the term absolute risk reduction (ARR) is used, and computed as I u − I e {\\displaystyle I_{u}-I_{e}} .[1][2]","image":"c1470f663700dcc33fd15ba46247e01f8e1fe9a3.svg","url":"Risk_difference"}
