{"title":"Hilbert C*-module","summary":"Hilbert C*-modules are mathematical objects that generalise the notion of a Hilbert space (which itself is a generalisation of Euclidean space), in that they endow a linear space with an \"inner product\" that takes values in a C*-algebra.  Hilbert C*-modules were first introduced in the work of Irving Kaplansky in 1953, which developed the theory for commutative, unital algebras (though Kaplansky observed that the assumption of a unit element was not \"vital\").[1] In the 1970s the theory was extended to non-commutative C*-algebras independently by William Lindall Paschke[2] and Marc Rieffel, the latter in a paper that used Hilbert C*-modules to construct a theory of induced representations of C*-algebras.[3] Hilbert C*-modules are crucial to Kasparov's formulation of KK-theory,[4] and provide the right framework to extend the notion of Morita equivalence to C*-algebras.[5] They can be viewed as the generalization of vector bundles to noncommutative C*-algebras and as such play an important role in noncommutative geometry, notably in C*-algebraic quantum group theory,[6][7] and groupoid C*-algebras.","image":"87be9f907218d647833da77d3cbd16af68dac8b3.svg","url":"Hilbert_C*-module"}
