{"title":"Compactness theorem","summary":"In mathematical logic, the compactness theorem states that a set of first-order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model. This theorem is an important tool in model theory, as it provides a useful (but generally not effective) method for constructing models of any set of sentences that is finitely consistent.","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Compactness_theorem"}
