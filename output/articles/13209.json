{"title":"Rectified 24-cell","summary":"In geometry, the rectified 24-cell or rectified icositetrachoron is a uniform 4-dimensional polytope (or uniform 4-polytope), which is bounded by 48 cells: 24 cubes, and 24 cuboctahedra. It can be obtained by rectification of the 24-cell, reducing its octahedral cells to cubes and cuboctahedra.[1]","image":"Schlegel_half-solid_cantellated_16-cell.png.webp","url":"Rectified_24-cell"}
