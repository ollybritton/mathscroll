{"title":"Quartic reciprocity","summary":"Quartic or  biquadratic reciprocity is a collection of theorems in elementary and algebraic  number theory that state conditions under which the congruence x4 ≡ p (mod q) is solvable; the word \"reciprocity\" comes from the form of some of these theorems, in that they relate the solvability of the congruence x4 ≡ p (mod q) to that of x4 ≡ q (mod p).","image":"f303dc73df15d7c44c885604c622d2b0861ac021.svg","url":"Quartic_reciprocity"}
