{"title":"Szemerédi regularity lemma","summary":"Szemerédi's regularity lemma is one of the most powerful tools in extremal graph theory, particularly in the study of large dense graphs. It states that the vertices of every large enough graph can be partitioned into a bounded number of parts so that the edges between different parts behave almost randomly.","image":"Epsilon_regular_partition.png.webp","url":"Szemerédi_regularity_lemma"}
