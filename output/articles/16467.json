{"title":"Ursell function","summary":"In statistical mechanics, an Ursell function or connected correlation function, is a cumulant of a random variable. It can often be obtained by summing over connected Feynman diagrams (the sum over all Feynman diagrams gives the correlation functions).","image":"723b871022c909941d85987e42c1647d565e67ed.svg","url":"Ursell_function"}
