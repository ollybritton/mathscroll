{"title":"Moduli of algebraic curves","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a moduli space of (algebraic) curves  is a geometric space (typically a scheme or an algebraic stack) whose points represent isomorphism classes of algebraic curves.  It is thus a special case of a moduli space. Depending on the restrictions applied to the classes of algebraic curves considered, the corresponding moduli problem and the moduli space is different. One also distinguishes between  fine and coarse moduli spaces for the same moduli problem.","image":"43d9ec21af6dbbe97151cd1f34d8d153e57c38d5.svg","url":"Moduli_of_algebraic_curves"}
