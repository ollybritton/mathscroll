{"title":"Wu's method of characteristic set","summary":"Wenjun Wu's method is an algorithm for solving multivariate polynomial equations introduced in the late 1970s by the Chinese mathematician Wen-Tsun Wu. This method is based on the mathematical concept of characteristic set introduced in the late 1940s by J.F. Ritt. It is fully independent of the Gröbner basis method, introduced by Bruno Buchberger (1965), even if Gröbner bases may be used to compute characteristic sets.[1][2]","image":"ef549fbda7a2ed85b3f7c9853c6dcce6367922f2.svg","url":"Wu's_method_of_characteristic_set"}
