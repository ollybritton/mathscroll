{"title":"Bicentric polygon","summary":"In geometry, a bicentric polygon is a tangential polygon (a polygon all of whose sides are tangent to an inner incircle) which is also cyclic â€” that is, inscribed in an outer circle that passes through each vertex of the polygon. All triangles and all regular polygons are bicentric. On the other hand, a rectangle with unequal sides is not bicentric, because no circle can be tangent to all four sides.","image":"Equilateral_triangle_bicentric_001.svg.png.webp","url":"Bicentric_polygon"}
