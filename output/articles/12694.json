{"title":"Pseudo-Anosov map","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in topology, a pseudo-Anosov map is a type of a diffeomorphism or homeomorphism of a surface. It is a generalization of a linear Anosov diffeomorphism of the torus. Its definition relies on the notion of a measured foliation introduced by William Thurston, who also coined the term \"pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism\" when he proved his classification of diffeomorphisms of a surface.","image":"1381f49a77bb819d6e24860dc6a49f7372bc2375.svg","url":"Pseudo-Anosov_map"}
