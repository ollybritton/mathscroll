{"title":"Zermelo set theory","summary":"Zermelo set theory (sometimes denoted by Z-), as set out in a seminal paper in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo, is the ancestor of modern Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) and its extensions, such as von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory (NBG).  It bears certain differences from its descendants, which are not always understood, and are frequently misquoted.  This article sets out the original axioms, with the original text (translated into English) and original numbering.","image":"4c5c34250859b6f6d2a77b4e8a2ceaa90638076d.svg","url":"Zermelo_set_theory"}
