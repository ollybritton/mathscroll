{"title":"Countably generated space","summary":"In mathematics, a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} is called countably generated if the topology of X {\\displaystyle X} is determined by the countable sets in a similar way as the topology of a sequential space (or a Fr√©chet space) is determined by the convergent sequences.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Countably_generated_space"}
