{"title":"Math walk","summary":"A math walk, or math trail, is a type of themed walk in the US, where direct experience is translated into the language of mathematics or abstract mathematical sciences such as information science, computer science, decision science, or probability and statistics. Some sources specify how to create a math walk[1][2] whereas others define a math walk at a specific location such as a junior high school[3] or in Boston.[4] The journal The Mathematics Teacher includes a special section titled \"Mathematical Lens\" in many issues[5] with the metaphor of lens capturing seeing the world as mathematics.","image":"9c5cb15035c7c113aea1c4e9f8946f93f2d2bf7d.svg","url":"Math_walk"}
