{"title":"Binomial transform","summary":"In combinatorics, the binomial transform is a sequence transformation (i.e., a transform of a sequence) that computes its forward differences. It is closely related to the Euler transform, which is the result of applying the binomial transform to the sequence associated with its ordinary generating function.","image":"9211322604284ab683d2f72f38124ba46372a6d4.svg","url":"Binomial_transform"}
