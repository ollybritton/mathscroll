{"title":"Quadratic integrate and fire","summary":"The quadratic integrate and fire (QIF) model is a biological neuron model and a type of integrate-and-fire neuron which describes action potentials in neurons. In contrast to physiologically accurate but computationally expensive neuron models like the Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model, the QIF model seeks only to produce action potential-like patterns and ignores subtleties like gating variables, which play an important role in generating action potentials in a real neuron. However, the QIF model is incredibly easy to implement and compute, and relatively straightforward to study and understand, thus has found ubiquitous use in computational neuroscience.[1]","image":"b5205f9b7db73452436fc5d30b8fbc9523970b39.svg","url":"Quadratic_integrate_and_fire"}
