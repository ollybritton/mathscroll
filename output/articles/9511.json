{"title":"List of mathematical constants","summary":"A mathematical constant is a key number whose value is fixed by an unambiguous definition, often referred to by a symbol (e.g., an alphabet letter), or by mathematicians' names to facilitate using it across multiple mathematical problems.[1] For example, the constant Ï€ may be defined as the ratio of the length of a circle's circumference to its diameter. The following list includes a decimal expansion and set containing each number, ordered by year of discovery.","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"List_of_mathematical_constants"}
