{"title":"Linear extension","summary":"In order theory, a branch of mathematics, a linear extension of a partial order is a total order (or linear order) that is compatible with the partial order. As a classic example, the lexicographic order of totally ordered sets is a linear extension of their product order.","image":"24112548985eab096493f73f838580442780b57f.svg","url":"Linear_extension"}
