{"title":"Robin boundary condition","summary":"In mathematics,  the Robin boundary condition (/ˈrɒbɪn/; properly French: [ʁɔbɛ̃]), or third type boundary condition, is a type of boundary condition, named  after Victor Gustave Robin (1855–1897).[1] When imposed on an ordinary or a  partial differential equation, it is a specification of a linear combination of the  values of a function and the values of its derivative on the boundary of the domain. Other equivalent names in use are Fourier-type condition and radiation condition.[2]","image":"aa0820cdcaa1b59b7ec280ada2f4c58d949271b4.svg","url":"Robin_boundary_condition"}
