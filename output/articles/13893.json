{"title":"Sard's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Sard's theorem, also known as Sard's lemma or the Morseâ€“Sard theorem, is a result in mathematical analysis that asserts that the set of critical values (that is, the image of the set of critical points) of a smooth function f from one Euclidean space or manifold to another is a null set, i.e., it has Lebesgue measure 0. This makes the set of critical values \"small\" in the sense of a generic property. The theorem is named for Anthony Morse and Arthur Sard.","image":"bacff7c234cf87f130fa41fa8612ed9e5380126b.svg","url":"Sard's_theorem"}
