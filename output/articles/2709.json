{"title":"Classical Hamiltonian quaternions","summary":"William Rowan Hamilton invented quaternions, a mathematical entity in 1843. This article describes Hamilton's original treatment of quaternions, using his notation and terms. Hamilton's treatment is more geometric than the modern approach, which emphasizes quaternions' algebraic properties. Mathematically, quaternions discussed differ from the modern definition only by the terminology which is used.","image":"7597067430c9e1ea0515c27697c660d10a45e30e.svg","url":"Classical_Hamiltonian_quaternions"}
