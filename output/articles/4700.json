{"title":"Eisenstein triple","summary":"Similar to a Pythagorean triple, an Eisenstein triple (named after Gotthold Eisenstein) is a set of integers which are the lengths of the sides of a triangle where one of the angles is 60 or 120 degrees. The relation of such triangles to the Eisenstein integers is analogous to the relation of Pythagorean triples to the Gaussian integers.","image":"Eisenstein_triple.png.webp","url":"Eisenstein_triple"}
