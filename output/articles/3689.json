{"title":"Cyclic number (group theory)","summary":"A cyclic number[1][2] is a natural number n such that n and φ(n) are coprime. Here φ is Euler's totient function. An equivalent definition is that a number n is cyclic if and only if any group of order n is cyclic.[3]","image":"Symbol_portal_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Cyclic_number_(group_theory)"}
