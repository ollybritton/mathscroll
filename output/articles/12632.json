{"title":"Prolate spheroidal wave function","summary":"The prolate spheroidal wave functions are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian in prolate spheroidal coordinates, adapted to boundary conditions on certain ellipsoids of revolution (an ellipse rotated around its long axis, “cigar shape“). Related are the oblate spheroidal wave functions (“pancake shaped” ellipsoid).[1]","image":"b66d266a73fb1e333897b4ab5219f84b7f6d4190.svg","url":"Prolate_spheroidal_wave_function"}
