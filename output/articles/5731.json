{"title":"Freivalds' algorithm","summary":"Freivalds' algorithm (named after Rūsiņš Mārtiņš Freivalds) is a probabilistic randomized algorithm used to verify matrix multiplication. Given three n × n matrices A {\\displaystyle A} , B {\\displaystyle B} , and C {\\displaystyle C} , a general problem is to verify whether A × B = C {\\displaystyle A\\times B=C} . A naïve algorithm would compute the product A × B {\\displaystyle A\\times B} explicitly and compare term by term whether this product equals C {\\displaystyle C} . However, the best known matrix multiplication algorithm runs in O ( n 2.3729 ) {\\displaystyle O(n^{2.3729})} time.[1] Freivalds' algorithm utilizes randomization in order to reduce this time bound to O ( n 2 ) {\\displaystyle O(n^{2})} [2] with high probability. In O ( k n 2 ) {\\displaystyle O(kn^{2})} time the algorithm can verify a matrix product with probability of failure less than 2 − k {\\displaystyle 2^{-k}} .","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Freivalds'_algorithm"}
