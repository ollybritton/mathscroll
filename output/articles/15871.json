{"title":"Topology optimization","summary":"Topology optimization (TO) is a mathematical method that optimizes material layout within a given design space, for a given set of loads, boundary conditions and constraints with the goal of maximizing the performance of the system. Topology optimization is different from shape optimization and sizing optimization in the sense that the design can attain any shape within the design space, instead of dealing with predefined configurations.","image":"781c57373b86ce571c6bbcec9fec4a73fe0c8feb.svg","url":"Topology_optimization"}
