{"title":"Codazzi tensor","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a Codazzi tensor (named after Delfino Codazzi) is a symmetric 2-tensor whose covariant derivative is also symmetric. Such tensors arise naturally in the study of Riemannian manifolds with harmonic curvature or harmonic Weyl tensor. In fact, existence of Codazzi tensors impose strict conditions on the curvature tensor of the manifold. Also, the second fundamental form of an immersed hypersurface in a space form (relative to a local choice of normal field) is a Codazzi tensor.","image":"68e27d2e539fd0c3a9a7efab6257abd17de7fc57.svg","url":"Codazzi_tensor"}
