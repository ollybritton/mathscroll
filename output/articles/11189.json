{"title":"Nonmetricity tensor","summary":"In mathematics, the nonmetricity tensor in differential geometry is the covariant derivative of the metric tensor.[1][2] It is therefore a tensor field of order three. It vanishes for the case of Riemannian geometry and can be used to study non-Riemannian spacetimes.[3]","image":"42abf40601db843e577166f52f38d24ccc2e12a5.svg","url":"Nonmetricity_tensor"}
