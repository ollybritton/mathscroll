{"title":"Iterated function","summary":"In mathematics, an iterated function is a function X → X (that is, a function from some set X to itself) which is obtained  by composing another function f : X → X with itself a certain number of times. The process of repeatedly applying the same function is called iteration. In this process, starting from some initial object, the result of applying a given function is fed again in the function as input, and this process is repeated.
