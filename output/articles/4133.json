{"title":"Dimension doubling theorem","summary":"In probability theory, the dimension doubling theorems are two results about the Hausdorff dimension of an image of a Brownian motion. In their core both statements say, that the dimension of a set A {\\displaystyle A} under a Brownian motion doubles almost surely.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Dimension_doubling_theorem"}
