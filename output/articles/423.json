{"title":"Affine arithmetic","summary":"Affine arithmetic (AA) is a model for self-validated numerical analysis.  In AA, the quantities of interest are represented as affine combinations (affine forms) of certain primitive variables, which stand for sources of uncertainty in the data or approximations made during the computation.","image":"2a767015b117abd7648a2e9c2907ec09e446ed3f.svg","url":"Affine_arithmetic"}
