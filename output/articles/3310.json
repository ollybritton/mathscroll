{"title":"Continuous-time Markov chain","summary":"A continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is a continuous stochastic process in which, for each state, the process will change state according to an exponential random variable and then move to a different state as specified by the probabilities of a stochastic matrix. An equivalent formulation describes the process as changing state according to the least value of a set of exponential random variables, one for each possible state it can move to, with the parameters determined by the current state.","image":"c8bcd3e73fd8dad91c76086e26cb6f8cf8d78b4c.svg","url":"Continuous-time_Markov_chain"}
