{"title":"Miquel's theorem","summary":"Miquel's theorem is a result in geometry, named after Auguste Miquel,[1] concerning the intersection of three circles, each drawn through one vertex of a triangle and two points on its adjacent sides. It is one of several results concerning circles in Euclidean geometry due to Miquel, whose work was published in Liouville's newly founded journal Journal de mathématiques pures et appliquées.","image":"Miquel_Circles.svg.png.webp","url":"Miquel's_theorem"}
