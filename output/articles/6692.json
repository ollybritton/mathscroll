{"title":"Gyroelongated pentagonal birotunda","summary":"In geometry, the gyroelongated pentagonal birotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J48). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a pentagonal birotunda (either J34 or the icosidodecahedron) by inserting a decagonal antiprism between its two halves.","image":"Gyroelongated_pentagonal_birotunda.png.webp","url":"Gyroelongated_pentagonal_birotunda"}
