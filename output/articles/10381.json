{"title":"Metrizable space","summary":"In topology and related areas of mathematics, a metrizable space is a topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space. That is, a topological space ( X , τ ) {\\displaystyle (X,\\tau )} is said to be metrizable if there is a metric d : X × X → [ 0 , ∞ ) {\\displaystyle d:X\\times X\\to [0,\\infty )} such that the topology induced by d {\\displaystyle d} is τ . {\\displaystyle \\tau .} [1][2] Metrization theorems are theorems that give sufficient conditions for a topological space to be metrizable.","image":"dede4b8004c6222d11e9b1a9802dc0496ad7e1fc.svg","url":"Metrizable_space"}
