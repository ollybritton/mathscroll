{"title":"Choi–Williams distribution function","summary":"Choi–Williams distribution function is one of the members of Cohen's class distribution function.[1] It was first proposed by Hyung-Ill Choi and William J. Williams in 1989. This distribution function adopts exponential kernel to suppress the cross-term. However, the kernel gain does not decrease along the η , τ {\\displaystyle \\eta ,\\tau } axes in the ambiguity domain. Consequently, the kernel function of Choi–Williams distribution function can only filter out the cross-terms that result from the components that differ in both time and frequency center.","image":"0e2775583a07a27a1b1824f7828b996c504583a4.svg","url":"Choi–Williams_distribution_function"}
