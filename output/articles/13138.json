{"title":"Ratio","summary":"In mathematics, a ratio (/rɑːʃoʊˌ reɪ-/) shows how many times one number contains another. For example, if there are eight oranges and six lemons in a bowl of fruit, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8:6, which is equivalent to the ratio 4:3). Similarly, the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6:8 (or 3:4) and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8:14 (or 4:7).","image":"Aspect-ratio-4x3.svg.png.webp","url":"Ratio"}
