{"title":"Straight-line program","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in computational algebra, a straight-line program (SLP) for a finite group G = ⟨S⟩ is a  finite sequence L of elements of G such that every element of L either belongs to S, is the inverse of a preceding element, or the product of two preceding elements. An SLP L is said to compute a group element g ∈ G if g ∈ L, where g is encoded by a word in S and its inverses.","image":"ba2c023bad1bd39ed49080f729cbf26bc448c9ba.svg","url":"Straight-line_program"}
