{"title":"Stochastic chains with memory of variable length","summary":"Stochastic chains with memory of variable length are a family of stochastic chains of finite order in a finite alphabet, such as, for every time pass, only one finite suffix of the past, called context, is necessary to predict the next symbol. These models were introduced in the information theory literature by Jorma Rissanen in 1983,[1] as a universal tool to data compression, but recently have been used to model data in different areas such as biology,[2] linguistics[3] and music.[4]","image":"d7231f963c8ca703c5d15c15f109454abe8690af.svg","url":"Stochastic_chains_with_memory_of_variable_length"}
