{"title":"Bijective numeration","summary":"Bijective numeration is any numeral system in which every non-negative integer can be represented in exactly one way using a finite string of digits. The name refers to the bijection (i.e. one-to-one correspondence) that exists in this case between the set of non-negative integers and the set of finite strings using a finite set of symbols (the \"digits\").","image":"0a36bd81384d4da57626f26a5d15acdcf56645c4.svg","url":"Bijective_numeration"}
