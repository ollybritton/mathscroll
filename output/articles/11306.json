{"title":"Nyström method","summary":"In mathematics numerical analysis, the Nyström method[1] or quadrature method seeks the numerical solution of an integral equation by replacing the integral with a representative weighted sum.  The continuous problem is broken into n {\\displaystyle n} discrete intervals; quadrature or numerical integration determines the weights and locations of representative points for the integral.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Nyström_method"}
