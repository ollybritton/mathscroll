{"title":"Webbed space","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in functional analysis, a webbed space is a topological vector space designed with the goal of allowing the results of the open mapping theorem and the closed graph theorem to hold for a wider class of linear maps whose codomains are webbed spaces. A space is called webbed if there exists a collection of sets, called a web that satisfies certain properties. Webs were first investigated by de Wilde.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Webbed_space"}
