{"title":"Mollifier","summary":"In mathematics, mollifiers (also known as approximations to the identity) are smooth functions with special properties, used for example in distribution theory to create sequences of smooth functions approximating nonsmooth (generalized) functions, via convolution. Intuitively, given a function which is rather irregular, by convolving it with a mollifier the function gets \"mollified\", that is, its sharp features are smoothed, while still remaining close to the original nonsmooth (generalized) function.[1]","image":"Mollified_Illustration.svg.png.webp","url":"Mollifier"}
