{"title":"Richard Swineshead","summary":"Richard Swineshead (also Suisset, Suiseth, etc.; fl. c. 1340 – 1354) was an English mathematician, logician, and natural philosopher. He was perhaps the greatest of the Oxford Calculators of Merton College, where he was a fellow certainly by 1344 and possibly by 1340. His magnum opus was a series of treatises known as the Liber calculationum (\"Book of Calculations\"), written c. 1350, which earned him the nickname of The Calculator.[1]","image":"Swineshead%2C_Richard_–_Calculator%2C_1520_–_BEIC_143141.jpg.webp","url":"Richard_Swineshead"}
