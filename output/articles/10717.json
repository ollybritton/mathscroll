{"title":"Morphism of finite type","summary":"For a homomorphism A → B of commutative rings, B is called an A-algebra of finite type if B is a finitely generated as an A-algebra. It is much stronger for B to be a finite A-algebra, which means that B is finitely generated as an A-module. For example, for any commutative ring A and natural number n, the polynomial ring A[x1, ..., xn] is an A-algebra of finite type, but it is not a finite A-module unless A = 0 or n = 0. Another example of a finite-type morphism which is not finite is C [ t ] → C [ t ] [ x , y ] / ( y 2 − x 3 − t ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} [t]\\to \\mathbb {C} [t][x,y]/(y^{2}-x^{3}-t)} .","image":"9baac4fec1c0ac773861cf0b6abf928b4f8a79a8.svg","url":"Morphism_of_finite_type"}
