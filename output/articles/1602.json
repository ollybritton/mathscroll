{"title":"Big O in probability notation","summary":"The order in probability notation is used in probability theory and statistical theory in direct parallel to the big-O notation that is standard in mathematics.  Where the big-O notation deals with the convergence of sequences or sets of ordinary numbers, the order in probability notation deals with convergence of sets of random variables, where convergence is in the sense of convergence in probability.[1]","image":"d4595d3eaa98927aeae9aaefeab00d57a437c3d4.svg","url":"Big_O_in_probability_notation"}
