{"title":"Stericated 8-simplexes","summary":"In eight-dimensional geometry, a stericated 8-simplex is a convex uniform 8-polytope with 4th order truncations (sterication) of the regular 8-simplex. There are 16 unique sterications for the 8-simplex including permutations of truncation, cantellation, and runcination.","image":"8-simplex_t0.svg.png.webp","url":"Stericated_8-simplexes"}
