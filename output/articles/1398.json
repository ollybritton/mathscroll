{"title":"Bayesian information criterion","summary":"In statistics, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or Schwarz information criterion (also SIC, SBC, SBIC) is a criterion for model selection among a finite set of models; models with lower BIC are generally preferred. It is based, in part, on the likelihood function and it is closely related to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).","image":"Bayes_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Bayesian_information_criterion"}
