{"title":"Tetrahedral bipyramid","summary":"In 4-dimensional geometry, the tetrahedral bipyramid is the direct sum of a tetrahedron and a segment, {3,3} + { }. Each face of a central tetrahedron is attached with two tetrahedra, creating 8 tetrahedral cells, 16 triangular faces, 14 edges, and 6 vertices,.[1] A tetrahedral bipyramid can be seen as two tetrahedral pyramids augmented together at their base.","image":"Tetrahedral_bipyramid-ortho.png.webp","url":"Tetrahedral_bipyramid"}
