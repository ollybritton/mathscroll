{"title":"Noetherian topological space","summary":"In mathematics, a Noetherian topological space, named for Emmy Noether, is a topological space in which closed subsets satisfy the descending chain condition.  Equivalently, we could say that the open subsets satisfy the ascending chain condition, since they are the complements of the closed subsets.  The Noetherian property of a topological space can also be seen as a strong compactness condition, namely that every open subset of such a space is compact, and in fact it is equivalent to the seemingly stronger statement that every subset is compact.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Noetherian_topological_space"}
