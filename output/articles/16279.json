{"title":"Tychonoff plank","summary":"In topology, the Tychonoff plank is a topological space defined using ordinal spaces that is a counterexample to several plausible-sounding conjectures. It is defined as the topological product of the two ordinal spaces [ 0 , ω 1 ] {\\displaystyle [0,\\omega _{1}]} and [ 0 , ω ] {\\displaystyle [0,\\omega ]} , where ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } is the first infinite ordinal and ω 1 {\\displaystyle \\omega _{1}} the first uncountable ordinal. The deleted Tychonoff plank is obtained by deleting the point ∞ = ( ω 1 , ω ) {\\displaystyle \\infty =(\\omega _{1},\\omega )} .","image":"cd08431e2f94a42dda5225e2cbb63f4712cdad30.svg","url":"Tychonoff_plank"}
