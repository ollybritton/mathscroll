{"title":"Topological manifold","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, a topological manifold is a topological space that locally resembles real n-dimensional Euclidean space. Topological manifolds are an important class of topological spaces, with applications throughout mathematics. All manifolds are topological manifolds by definition. Other types of manifolds are formed by adding structure to a topological manifold (e.g. differentiable manifolds are topological manifolds equipped with a differential structure). Every manifold has an \"underlying\" topological manifold, obtained by simply \"forgetting\" the added structure.[1] However, not every topological manifold can be endowed with a particular additional structure. For example, the E8 manifold is a topological manifold which cannot be endowed with a differentiable structure.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Topological_manifold"}
