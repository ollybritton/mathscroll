{"title":"Secant method","summary":"In numerical analysis, the secant method is a root-finding algorithm that uses a succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a root of a function f.  The secant method can be thought of as a finite-difference approximation of Newton's method. However, the secant method predates Newton's method by over 3000 years.[1]","image":"Secant_method.svg.png.webp","url":"Secant_method"}
