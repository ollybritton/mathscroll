{"title":"Polynomial long division","summary":"In algebra, polynomial long division is an algorithm for dividing a polynomial by another polynomial of the same or lower degree, a generalized version of the familiar arithmetic technique called long division. It can be done easily by hand, because it separates an otherwise complex division problem into smaller ones. Sometimes using a shorthand version called synthetic division is faster, with less writing and fewer calculations. Another abbreviated method is polynomial short division (Blomqvist's method).","image":"91c655a4b6470030c1f4a1ead0b6595ea0fa0fde.svg","url":"Polynomial_long_division"}
