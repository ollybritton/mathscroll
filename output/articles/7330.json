{"title":"Hofstadter points","summary":"In triangle geometry, a Hofstadter point is a special point associated with every  plane triangle. In fact there are several Hofstadter points associated with a triangle. All of them are  triangle centers. Two of them, the Hofstadter zero-point and Hofstadter one-point, are particularly interesting.[1]  They are two transcendental triangle centers. Hofstadter zero-point is the center designated as X(360) and the Hofstafter one-point is the center denoted as X(359) in Clark Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. The Hofstadter zero-point was discovered  by Douglas Hofstadter in 1992.[1]","image":"HofstadterPoint.svg.png.webp","url":"Hofstadter_points"}
