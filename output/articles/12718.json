{"title":"Pseudoforest","summary":"In graph theory, a pseudoforest is an undirected graph[1] in which every connected component has at most one cycle. That is, it is a system of vertices and edges connecting pairs of vertices, such that no two  cycles of consecutive edges share any vertex with each other, nor can any two cycles be connected to each other by a path of consecutive edges.  A pseudotree is a connected pseudoforest.","image":"Pseudoforest.svg.png.webp","url":"Pseudoforest"}
