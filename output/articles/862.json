{"title":"Antiderivative","summary":"In calculus, an antiderivative, inverse derivative, primitive function, primitive integral or indefinite integral[Note 1] of a function f is a differentiable function F whose derivative is equal to the original function f. This can be stated symbolically as F'  = f.[1][2] The process of solving for antiderivatives is called antidifferentiation (or indefinite integration), and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a derivative. Antiderivatives are often denoted by capital Roman letters such as F and G.","image":"Slope_Field.png.webp","url":"Antiderivative"}
