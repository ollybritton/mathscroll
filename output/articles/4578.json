{"title":"EXPTIME","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the complexity class EXPTIME (sometimes called EXP or DEXPTIME) is the set of all decision problems that are solvable by a deterministic Turing machine  in exponential time, i.e., in O(2p(n)) time, where p(n) is a polynomial function of n.","image":"704b3bae24d1fd0de0e58f29ef212a683625d25c.svg","url":"EXPTIME"}
