{"title":"Montel space","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, a Montel space, named after Paul Montel, is any topological vector space (TVS) in which an analog of Montel's theorem holds.  Specifically, a Montel space is a barrelled topological vector space in which every closed and bounded subset is compact.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Montel_space"}
