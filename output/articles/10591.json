{"title":"Modular decomposition","summary":"In graph theory, the modular decomposition is a decomposition of a graph into subsets of vertices called modules.  A module is a generalization of a connected component of a graph.  Unlike connected components, however, one module can be a proper subset of another.   Modules therefore lead to a recursive (hierarchical) decomposition of the graph, instead of just a partition.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Modular_decomposition"}
