{"title":"History of logarithms","summary":"The history of logarithms is the story of a correspondence (in modern terms, a group isomorphism) between multiplication on the positive real numbers and addition on the real number line that was formalized in seventeenth century Europe and was widely used to simplify calculation until the advent of the digital computer.  The Napierian logarithms were published first in 1614. E. W. Hobson called it \"one of the very greatest scientific discoveries that the world has seen.\"[1]: p.5  Henry Briggs introduced common (base 10) logarithms, which were easier to use. Tables of logarithms were published in many forms over four centuries. The idea of logarithms was also used to construct the slide rule, which became ubiquitous in science and engineering until the 1970s. A breakthrough generating the natural logarithm was the result of a search for an expression of area against a rectangular hyperbola, and required the assimilation of a new function into standard mathematics.","image":"Mirifici_Logarithmorum_canonis_Descriptio.jpg.webp","url":"History_of_logarithms"}
