{"title":"Types of mesh","summary":"A mesh is a representation of a larger geometric domain by smaller discrete cells. Meshes are commonly used to compute solutions of partial differential equations and render computer graphics, and to analyze geographical and cartographic data. A mesh partitions space into elements (or cells or zones) over which the equations can be solved, which then approximates the solution over the larger domain. Element boundaries may be constrained to lie on internal or external boundaries within a model. Higher-quality (better-shaped) elements have better numerical properties, where what constitutes a \"better\" element depends on the general governing equations and the particular solution to the model instance.","image":"Two_Dim_Grid.PNG.webp","url":"Types_of_mesh"}
