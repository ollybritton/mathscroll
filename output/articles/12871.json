{"title":"Quantum logic","summary":"In the mathematical study of logic and the physical analysis of quantum foundations, quantum logic is a set of rules for manipulation of propositions inspired by the structure of quantum theory.  The field takes as its starting point an observation of Garrett Birkhoff and John vonÂ Neumann, that the structure of experimental tests in classical mechanics forms a Boolean algebra, but the structure of experimental tests in quantum mechanics forms a much more complicated structure.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg","url":"Quantum_logic"}
