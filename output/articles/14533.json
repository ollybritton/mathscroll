{"title":"Small Latin squares and quasigroups","summary":"Latin squares and quasigroups are equivalent mathematical objects, although the former has a combinatorial nature while the latter is more algebraic. The listing below will consider the examples of some very small orders, which is the side length of the square, or the number of elements in the equivalent quasigroup.","image":"b438327d8ab0eda262ae027a7caab542e8d5d486.svg","url":"Small_Latin_squares_and_quasigroups"}
