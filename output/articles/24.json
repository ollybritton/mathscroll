{"title":"15 and 290 theorems","summary":"In mathematics, the 15 theorem or Conwayâ€“Schneeberger Fifteen Theorem, proved by John H. Conway and W. A. Schneeberger in 1993, states that if a positive definite quadratic form with integer matrix represents all positive integers up to 15, then it represents all positive integers.[1] The proof was complicated, and was never published. Manjul Bhargava found a much simpler proof which was published in 2000.[2]","image":"64db595665a615bde5bad2868d822ead86de1ddc.svg","url":"15_and_290_theorems"}
