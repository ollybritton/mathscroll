{"title":"Silverman–Toeplitz theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Silverman–Toeplitz theorem, first proved by Otto Toeplitz, is a result in summability theory characterizing matrix summability methods that are regular. A regular matrix summability method is a matrix transformation of a convergent sequence which preserves the limit.[1]","image":"6d88c66209663e5ba74a1454f12e90103914ae2b.svg","url":"Silverman–Toeplitz_theorem"}
