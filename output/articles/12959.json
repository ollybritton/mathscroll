{"title":"Quaternionic manifold","summary":"In differential geometry, a quaternionic manifold is a quaternionic analog of a complex manifold. The definition is more complicated and technical than the one for complex manifolds due in part to the noncommutativity of the quaternions and in part to the lack of a suitable calculus of holomorphic functions for quaternions. The most succinct definition uses the language of G-structures on a manifold. Specifically, a quaternionic n-manifold can be defined as a smooth manifold of real dimension 4n equipped with a torsion-free GL ⁡ ( n , H ) ⋅ H × {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {GL} (n,\\mathbb {H} )\\cdot \\mathbb {H} ^{\\times }} -structure. More naïve, but straightforward, definitions lead to a dearth of examples, and exclude spaces like quaternionic projective space which should clearly be considered as quaternionic manifolds.","image":"ad901601ce1527f1722432b4dac6a886c0ddd56c.svg","url":"Quaternionic_manifold"}
