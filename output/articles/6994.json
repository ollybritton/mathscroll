{"title":"Heilbronn set","summary":"In mathematics, a Heilbronn set is an infinite set S of natural numbers for which every real number can be arbitrarily closely approximated by a fraction whose denominator is in S. For any given real number θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } and natural number h {\\displaystyle h} , it is easy to find the integer g {\\displaystyle g} such that g / h {\\displaystyle g/h} is closest to θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } . For example, for the real number π {\\displaystyle \\pi } and h = 100 {\\displaystyle h=100} we have g = 314 {\\displaystyle g=314} . If we call the closeness of θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } to g / h {\\displaystyle g/h} the difference between h θ {\\displaystyle h\\theta } and g {\\displaystyle g} , the closeness is always less than 1/2 (in our example it is 0.15926...). A collection of numbers is a Heilbronn set if for any θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } we can always find a sequence of values for h {\\displaystyle h} in the set where the closeness tends to zero.","image":"6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af.svg","url":"Heilbronn_set"}
