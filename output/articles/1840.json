{"title":"Boolean model (probability theory)","summary":"For statistics in probability theory, the Boolean-Poisson model  or simply Boolean model for a random subset of the plane (or higher dimensions, analogously) is one of the simplest and most tractable models in stochastic geometry.  Take a Poisson point process of rate λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } in the plane and make each point be the center of a random set; the resulting union of overlapping sets is a realization of the Boolean model B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}} .  More precisely, the parameters are λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } and a probability distribution on compact sets; for each point ξ {\\displaystyle \\xi } of the Poisson point process we pick a set C ξ {\\displaystyle C_{\\xi }} from the distribution, and then define B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}} as the union ∪ ξ ( ξ + C ξ ) {\\displaystyle \\cup _{\\xi }(\\xi +C_{\\xi })} of translated sets.","image":"b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a.svg","url":"Boolean_model_(probability_theory)"}
