{"title":"Gradient theorem","summary":"The gradient theorem, also known as the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals, says that a line integral through a gradient field can be evaluated by evaluating the original scalar field at the endpoints of the curve. The theorem is a generalization of the second fundamental theorem of calculus to any curve in a plane or space (generally n-dimensional) rather than just the real line.","image":"876275519718498ba01a2b1fad005cb230e1f369.svg","url":"Gradient_theorem"}
