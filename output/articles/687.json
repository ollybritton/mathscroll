{"title":"Alternating-direction implicit method","summary":"In numerical linear algebra, the alternating-direction implicit (ADI) method is an iterative method used to solve Sylvester matrix equations. It is a popular method for solving the large matrix equations that arise in systems theory and control,[1] and can be formulated to construct solutions in a memory-efficient, factored form.[2][3] It is also used to numerically solve parabolic and elliptic partial differential equations, and is a classic method used for modeling heat conduction and solving the diffusion equation in two or more dimensions.[4] It is an example of an operator splitting method.[5]","image":"ed9cbe23148c800d58dbc85eb10ad606c65442f7.svg","url":"Alternating-direction_implicit_method"}
