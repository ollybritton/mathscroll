{"title":"Keller's conjecture","summary":"In geometry, Keller's conjecture is the conjecture that in any tiling of n-dimensional Euclidean space by identical hypercubes, there are two hypercubes that share an entire (n âˆ’ 1)-dimensional face with each other. For instance, in any tiling of the plane by identical squares, some two squares must share an entire edge, as they do in the illustration.","image":"Shifted_square_tiling.svg.png.webp","url":"Keller's_conjecture"}
