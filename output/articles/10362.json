{"title":"Method of matched asymptotic expansions","summary":"In mathematics, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is a common approach to finding an accurate approximation to the solution to an equation, or system of equations. It is particularly used when solving singularly perturbed differential equations. It involves finding several different approximate solutions, each of which is valid (i.e. accurate) for part of the range of the independent variable, and then combining these different solutions together to give a single approximate solution that is valid for the whole range of values of the independent variable. In the Russian literature, these methods were known under the name of \"intermediate asymptotics\" and were introduced in the work of Yakov Zeldovich and Grigory Barenblatt.","image":"cb060f3b31f551497de2f2b8322c6181db33d3a4.svg","url":"Method_of_matched_asymptotic_expansions"}
