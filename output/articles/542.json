{"title":"Alexander polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, the Alexander polynomial is a knot invariant which assigns a polynomial with integer coefficients to each knot type.  James Waddell Alexander II discovered this, the first knot polynomial, in 1923.  In 1969, John Conway showed a version of this polynomial, now called the Alexanderâ€“Conway polynomial, could be computed using a skein relation, although its significance was not realized until the discovery of the Jones polynomial in 1984.  Soon after Conway's reworking of the Alexander polynomial, it was realized that a similar skein relation was exhibited in Alexander's paper on his polynomial.[1]","image":"1daf37d45ddbb3999d6395aa6cd3b2275da6cbf1.svg","url":"Alexander_polynomial"}
