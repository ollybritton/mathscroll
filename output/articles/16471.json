{"title":"Urysohn and completely Hausdorff spaces","summary":"In topology, a discipline within mathematics, an Urysohn space, or T2Â½ space, is a topological space in which any two distinct points can be separated by closed neighborhoods. A completely Hausdorff space, or functionally Hausdorff space, is a topological space in which any two distinct points can be separated by a continuous function. These conditions are separation axioms that are somewhat stronger than the more familiar Hausdorff axiom T2.","image":"469b737d167b9b28a74e27c7f5e35b5ea9256100.svg","url":"Urysohn_and_completely_Hausdorff_spaces"}
