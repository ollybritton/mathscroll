{"title":"Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations","summary":"In mathematical physics the Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations, or KZ equations, are linear differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions (on the Riemann sphere) of two-dimensional conformal field theories associated with an affine Lie algebra at a fixed level. They form a system of complex partial differential equations with regular singular points satisfied by the N-point functions of affine primary fields and can be derived using either the formalism of Lie algebras or that of vertex algebras.","image":"c51811f22205fb0162d57c2af300c3f4caee228b.svg","url":"Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov_equations"}
