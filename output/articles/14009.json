{"title":"Schwarzschild geodesics","summary":"In general relativity, Schwarzschild geodesics describe the motion of test particles in the gravitational field of a central fixed mass M , {\\textstyle M,} that is, motion in the Schwarzschild metric. Schwarzschild geodesics have been pivotal in the validation of Einstein's theory of general relativity. For example, they provide accurate predictions of the anomalous precession of the planets in the Solar System and of the deflection of light by gravity.","image":"6e7ef346e933a3d5c545d2954d84668d66616e94.svg","url":"Schwarzschild_geodesics"}
