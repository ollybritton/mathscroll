{"title":"Differential-algebraic system of equations","summary":"In electrical engineering, a differential-algebraic system of equations (DAEs) is a system of equations that either contains differential equations and algebraic equations, or is equivalent to such a system. In mathematics these are examples of differential algebraic varieties and correspond to ideals in differential polynomial rings (see the article on differential algebra for the algebraic setup.","image":"bbe181a39f07d884cf6a96af80791282327d8c48.svg","url":"Differential-algebraic_system_of_equations"}
