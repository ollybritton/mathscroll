{"title":"Mackey space","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in functional analysis, a Mackey space is a locally convex topological vector space X such that the topology of X coincides with the Mackey topology τ(X,X′), the finest topology which still preserves the continuous dual. They are named after George Mackey.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Mackey_space"}
