{"title":"Buchsbaum ring","summary":"In mathematics, Buchsbaum rings are Noetherian local rings such that every system of parameters is a weak sequence. A sequence ( a 1 , ⋯ , a r ) {\\displaystyle (a_{1},\\cdots ,a_{r})} of the maximal ideal m {\\displaystyle m} is called a weak sequence if m ⋅ ( ( a 1 , ⋯ , a i − 1 ) : a i ) ⊂ ( a 1 , ⋯ , a i − 1 ) {\\displaystyle m\\cdot ((a_{1},\\cdots ,a_{i-1})\\colon a_{i})\\subset (a_{1},\\cdots ,a_{i-1})} for all i {\\displaystyle i} .","image":"afc56046163c4030f48b5e1060c4284b64f327ec.svg","url":"Buchsbaum_ring"}
