{"title":"Metric space aimed at its subspace","summary":"In mathematics, a metric space aimed at its subspace is a categorical construction that has a direct geometric meaning.  It is also a useful step toward the construction of the metric envelope, or tight span, which are basic (injective) objects of the category of metric spaces.","image":"353b17cebe3a7597ff34e98deabd3b156be745d7.svg","url":"Metric_space_aimed_at_its_subspace"}
