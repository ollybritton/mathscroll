{"title":"Matroid intersection","summary":"In combinatorial optimization, the matroid intersection problem is to find a largest common independent set in two matroids over the same ground set. If the elements of the matroid are assigned real weights, the weighted matroid intersection problem is to find a common independent set with the maximum possible weight. These problems generalize many problems in combinatorial optimization including finding maximum matchings and maximum weight matchings in bipartite graphs and finding arborescences in directed graphs.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Matroid_intersection"}
