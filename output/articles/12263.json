{"title":"Pointless topology","summary":"In mathematics, pointless topology, also called point-free topology (or pointfree topology) and locale theory, is an approach to topology that avoids mentioning points, and in which the lattices of open sets are the primitive notions.[1] In this approach it becomes possible to construct topologically interesting spaces from purely algebraic data.[2]","image":"7b76220c6805c9b465d6efbc7686c624f49f3023.svg","url":"Pointless_topology"}
