{"title":"Local rigidity","summary":"Local rigidity theorems in the theory of discrete subgroups of Lie groups are results which show that small deformations of certain such subgroups are always trivial. It is different from Mostow rigidity and weaker (but holds more frequently) than superrigidity.","image":"678e787a97fb9ac146efb322397ae30ec9d53d1e.svg","url":"Local_rigidity"}
