{"title":"Affine curvature","summary":"Special affine curvature, also known as the equiaffine curvature or affine curvature, is a particular type of curvature that is defined on a plane curve that remains unchanged under a special affine transformation (an affine transformation that preserves area).  The curves of constant equiaffine curvature k are precisely all non-singular plane conics.  Those with k > 0 are ellipses, those with k = 0 are parabolae, and those with k < 0 are hyperbolae.","image":"135e1bb453a46f9ffad60f0e72e7cbefb066168e.svg","url":"Affine_curvature"}
