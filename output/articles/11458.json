{"title":"Oracle complexity (optimization)","summary":"In mathematical optimization, oracle complexity is a standard theoretical framework to study the computational requirements for solving classes of optimization problems. It is suitable for analyzing iterative algorithms which proceed by computing local information about the objective function at various points (such as the function's value, gradient, Hessian etc.). The framework has been used to provide tight worst-case guarantees on the number of required iterations, for several important classes of optimization problems.","image":"c54b32c9d52e11d1db816a14b97a2a01cdf2a71f.svg","url":"Oracle_complexity_(optimization)"}
