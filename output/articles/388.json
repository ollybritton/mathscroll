{"title":"Adjugate matrix","summary":"In linear algebra, the adjugate or classical adjoint of a square matrix A is the transpose of its cofactor matrix and is denoted by adj(A).[1][2] It is also occasionally known as adjunct matrix,[3][4] or \"adjoint\",[5] though the latter term today normally refers to a different concept, the adjoint operator which for a matrix is the conjugate transpose.","image":"a225358d6ab810f76571b03db14ec1bfdfb2952c.svg","url":"Adjugate_matrix"}
