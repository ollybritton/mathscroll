{"title":"Binary tree","summary":"In computer science, a binary tree is a k-ary k = 2 {\\displaystyle k=2} tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the .mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#b1d2ff}left child and the right child.  A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root.[1] Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well.[2]","image":"0bd301789e1f25a3da4be297ff637754ebee5f5d.svg","url":"Binary_tree"}
