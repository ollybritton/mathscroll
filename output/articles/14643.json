{"title":"Soft configuration model","summary":"In applied mathematics, the soft configuration model (SCM) is a random graph model subject to the principle of maximum entropy under constraints on the expectation of the degree sequence of sampled graphs.[1] Whereas the configuration model (CM) uniformly samples random graphs of a specific degree sequence, the SCM only retains the specified degree sequence on average over all network realizations; in this sense the SCM has very relaxed constraints relative to those of the CM (\"soft\" rather than \"sharp\" constraints[2]). The SCM for graphs of size n {\\displaystyle n} has a nonzero probability of sampling any graph of size n {\\displaystyle n} , whereas the CM is restricted to only graphs having precisely the prescribed connectivity structure.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Soft_configuration_model"}
