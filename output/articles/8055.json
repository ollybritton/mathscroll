{"title":"Ishimori equation","summary":"The Ishimori equation is a partial differential equation proposed by the Japanese mathematician Ishimori (1984). Its interest is as the first example of a nonlinear spin-one field model in the plane that is integrable (Sattinger, Tracy & Venakides 1991, p.Â 78).","image":"d9f618798fea86f894c186a3dd10ec4fa8f8c857.svg","url":"Ishimori_equation"}
