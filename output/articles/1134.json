{"title":"Augmentation (algebra)","summary":"In algebra, an augmentation of an associative algebra A over a commutative ring k is a k-algebra homomorphism A → k {\\displaystyle A\\to k} , typically denoted by ε. An algebra together with an augmentation is called an augmented algebra. The kernel of the augmentation is a two-sided ideal called the augmentation ideal of A.","image":"ea0a95fde3c3bb52a94fc9683ccf598a0284ca00.svg","url":"Augmentation_(algebra)"}
