{"title":"Dimension theorem for vector spaces","summary":"In mathematics, the dimension theorem for vector spaces states that all bases of a vector space have equally many elements. This number of elements may be finite or infinite (in the latter case, it is a cardinal number), and defines the dimension of the vector space.","image":"e059be80c377091708f6a31cfa6ac2b38d3ad3ad.svg","url":"Dimension_theorem_for_vector_spaces"}
