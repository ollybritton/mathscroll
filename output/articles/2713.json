{"title":"Classical Wiener space","summary":"In mathematics, classical Wiener space is the collection of all continuous functions on a given domain (usually a subinterval of the real line), taking values in a metric space (usually n-dimensional Euclidean space). Classical Wiener space is useful in the study of stochastic processes whose sample paths are continuous functions. It is named after the American mathematician Norbert Wiener.","image":"Norbert_wiener.jpg.webp","url":"Classical_Wiener_space"}
