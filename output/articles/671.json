{"title":"Almost symplectic manifold","summary":"In differential geometry, an almost symplectic structure on a differentiable manifold M {\\displaystyle M} is a two-form ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } on M {\\displaystyle M} that is everywhere non-singular.[1]  If in addition ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } is closed then it is a symplectic form.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Almost_symplectic_manifold"}
