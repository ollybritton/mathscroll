{"title":"RAC drawing","summary":"In graph drawing, a RAC drawing of a graph is a drawing in which the vertices are represented as points, the edges are represented as straight line segments or polylines, at most two edges cross at any point, and when two edges cross they do so at right angles to each other. In the name of this drawing style, \"RAC\" stands for \"right angle crossing\".","image":"RAC_drawings.svg.png.webp","url":"RAC_drawing"}
