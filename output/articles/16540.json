{"title":"Vector fields in cylindrical and spherical coordinates","summary":"Note: This page uses common physics notation for spherical coordinates, in which θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } is the angle between the z axis and the radius vector connecting the origin to the point in question, while ϕ {\\displaystyle \\phi } is the angle between the projection of the radius vector onto the x-y plane and the x axis. Several other definitions are in use, and so care must be taken in comparing different sources.[1]","image":"6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af.svg","url":"Vector_fields_in_cylindrical_and_spherical_coordinates"}
