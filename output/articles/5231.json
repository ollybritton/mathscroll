{"title":"Extrinsic Geometric Flows","summary":"Extrinsic Geometric Flows is an advanced mathematics textbook that overviews geometric flows, mathematical problems in which a curve or surface moves continuously according to some rule. It focuses on extrinsic flows, in which the rule depends on the embedding of a surface into space, rather than intrinsic flows such as the Ricci flow that depend on the internal geometry of the surface and can be defined without respect to an embedding.","image":"Extrinsic_Geometric_Flows.jpg.webp","url":"Extrinsic_Geometric_Flows"}
