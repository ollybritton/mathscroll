{"title":"Vector potential","summary":"In vector calculus, a vector potential is a vector field whose curl is a given vector field. This is analogous to a scalar potential, which is a scalar field whose gradient is a given vector field.","image":"4fd6a5946b7e916352b0afc557f992328bac85e8.svg","url":"Vector_potential"}
