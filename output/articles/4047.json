{"title":"Dialectica interpretation","summary":"In proof theory, the Dialectica interpretation[1] is a proof interpretation of intuitionistic arithmetic (Heyting arithmetic) into a finite type extension of primitive recursive arithmetic, the so-called System T.  It was developed by Kurt Gödel to provide a consistency proof of arithmetic. The name of the interpretation comes from the journal Dialectica, where Gödel's paper was published in a 1958 special issue dedicated to Paul Bernays on his 70th birthday.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Dialectica_interpretation"}
