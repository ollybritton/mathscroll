{"title":"Appell series","summary":"In mathematics, Appell series are a set of four hypergeometric series F1, F2, F3, F4 of two variables that were introduced by Paul AppellÂ (1880) and that generalize Gauss's hypergeometric series 2F1 of one variable. Appell established the set of partial differential equations of which these functions are solutions, and found various reduction formulas and expressions of these series in terms of hypergeometric series of one variable.","image":"db9f251891d001b7a9be2a49124fd8d39b1c077a.svg","url":"Appell_series"}
