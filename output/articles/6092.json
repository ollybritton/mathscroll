{"title":"Generalized singular value decomposition","summary":"In linear algebra, the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) is the name of two different techniques based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). The two versions differ because one version decomposes two matrices (somewhat like the higher-order or tensor SVD) and the other version uses a set of constraints imposed on the left and right singular vectors of a single-matrix SVD.","image":"f9e1200c55f062d38108d482407e8a36b868eb91.svg","url":"Generalized_singular_value_decomposition"}
