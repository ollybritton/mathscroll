{"title":"7-demicube","summary":"In geometry, a demihepteract or 7-demicube is a uniform 7-polytope, constructed from the 7-hypercube (hepteract) with alternated vertices removed. It is part of a dimensionally infinite family of uniform polytopes called demihypercubes.","image":"Demihepteract_ortho_petrie.svg.png.webp","url":"7-demicube"}
