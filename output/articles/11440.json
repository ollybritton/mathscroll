{"title":"Operator norm","summary":"In mathematics, the operator norm measures the \"size\" of certain linear operators by assigning each a real number called its operator norm. Formally, it is a norm defined on the space of bounded linear operators between two given normed vector spaces. Informally, the operator norm ‖ T ‖ {\\displaystyle \\|T\\|} of a linear map T : X → Y {\\displaystyle T:X\\to Y} is the maximum factor by which it \"lengthens\" vectors.","image":"235ce5756ce4b5b38cc637dddb8eb7e2366b392c.svg","url":"Operator_norm"}
