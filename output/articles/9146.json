{"title":"Leftist grammar","summary":"In formal language theory, a leftist grammar is a formal grammar on which certain restrictions are made on the left and right sides of the grammar's productions. Only two types of productions are allowed, namely those of the form a → b a {\\displaystyle a\\to ba} (insertion rules) and c d → d {\\displaystyle cd\\to d} (deletion rules). Here, a , b , c {\\displaystyle a,b,c} and d {\\displaystyle d} are terminal symbols. This type of grammar was motivated by accessibility problems in the field computer security.[1]","image":"4900fb3be9641a8bde05e172e0e64439646055c9.svg","url":"Leftist_grammar"}
