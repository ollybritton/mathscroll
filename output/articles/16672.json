{"title":"Volume integral","summary":"In mathematics (particularly multivariable calculus), a volume integral (âˆ­) refers to an integral over a 3-dimensional domain; that is, it is a special case of multiple integrals. Volume integrals are especially important in physics for many applications, for example, to calculate flux densities.","image":"13996a303eacb86889fecb7cd989b9c67c495b9a.svg","url":"Volume_integral"}
