{"title":"Helly's selection theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Helly's selection theorem (also called the Helly selection principle) states that a uniformly bounded sequence of monotone real functions admits a convergent subsequence. In other words, it is a sequential compactness theorem for the space of uniformly bounded monotone functions. It is named for the Austrian mathematician Eduard Helly. A more general version of the theorem asserts compactness of the space BVloc of functions locally of bounded total variation that are uniformly bounded at a point.","image":"89c0e494ceb2b9112ff5ba0c5e5f8e7aa8efbd09.svg","url":"Helly's_selection_theorem"}
