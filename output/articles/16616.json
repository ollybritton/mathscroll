{"title":"Virasoro group","summary":"In abstract algebra, the Virasoro group or Bottâ€“Virasoro group (often denoted by Vir)[1] is an infinite-dimensional Lie group defined as the universal central extension of the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle. The corresponding Lie algebra is the Virasoro algebra, which has a key role in conformal field theory (CFT) and string theory.","image":"60796c8d0c03cf575637d3202463b214d9635880.svg","url":"Virasoro_group"}
