{"title":"Tetrad (geometry puzzle)","summary":"In geometry, a tetrad is a set of four simply connected disjoint planar regions in the plane, each pair sharing a finite portion of common boundary. It was named by Michael R. W. Buckley in 1975 in the Journal of Recreational Mathematics. A further question was proposed that became a puzzle, whether the 4 regions could be congruent, with or without holes, other enclosed regions.[1]","image":"Tetrad_solution0.svg.png.webp","url":"Tetrad_(geometry_puzzle)"}
