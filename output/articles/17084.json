{"title":"Yoneda lemma","summary":"In mathematics, the Yoneda lemma is arguably the most important result in category theory.[1]  It is an abstract result on functors of the type morphisms into a fixed object. It is a vast generalisation of Cayley's theorem from group theory (viewing a group as a miniature category with just one object and only isomorphisms). It allows the embedding of any locally small category into a category of functors (contravariant set-valued functors) defined on that category. It also clarifies how the embedded category, of representable functors and their natural transformations, relates to the other objects in the larger functor category. It is an important tool that underlies several modern developments in algebraic geometry and representation theory. It is named after Nobuo Yoneda.","image":"e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019.svg","url":"Yoneda_lemma"}
