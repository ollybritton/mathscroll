{"title":"Simpson's paradox","summary":"Simpson's paradox is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined. This result is often encountered in social-science and medical-science statistics,[1][2][3] and is particularly problematic when frequency data are unduly given causal interpretations.[4] The paradox can be resolved when confounding variables and causal relations are appropriately addressed in the statistical modeling[4][5] (e.g. through cluster analysis[6]).","image":"Simpson's_paradox_continuous.svg.png.webp","url":"Simpson's_paradox"}
