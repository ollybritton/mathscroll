{"title":"Combinatorial map","summary":"A combinatorial map is a combinatorial representation of a graph on an orientable surface. A combinatorial map may also be called a combinatorial embedding, a rotation system, an orientable ribbon graph, a fat graph, or a cyclic graph.[1] More generally, an n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional combinatorial map is a combinatorial representation of a graph on an n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional orientable manifold.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Combinatorial_map"}
