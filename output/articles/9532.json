{"title":"List of polygons","summary":"In geometry, a polygon is traditionally a plane figure that is bounded by a finite chain of straight line segments closing in a loop to form a closed chain. These segments are called its edges or sides, and the points where two of the edges meet are the polygon's vertices (singular: vertex) or corners.","image":"Regular_polygon_5_annotated.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_polygons"}
