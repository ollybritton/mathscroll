{"title":"NC (complexity)","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the class NC (for \"Nick's Class\") is the set of decision problems decidable in polylogarithmic time on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors.  In other words, a problem with input size n is in NC if there exist constants c and k such that it can be solved in time O(logcÂ n) using O(nk) parallel processors. Stephen Cook[1][2] coined the name \"Nick's class\" after Nick Pippenger, who had done extensive research[3] on circuits with polylogarithmic depth and polynomial size.[4]","image":"56e97a42d319bdaa47d8153dbf24ae35866419ec.svg","url":"NC_(complexity)"}
