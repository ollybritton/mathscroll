{"title":"Trigonometric polynomial","summary":"In the mathematical subfields of numerical analysis and mathematical analysis, a trigonometric polynomial is a finite linear combination of functions sin(nx) and cos(nx) with n taking on the values of one or more natural numbers. The coefficients may be taken as real numbers, for real-valued functions. For complex coefficients, there is no difference between such a function and a finite Fourier series.","image":"ff13e06fb0b2686ca4de6b1548350e58a3e0ae5c.svg","url":"Trigonometric_polynomial"}
