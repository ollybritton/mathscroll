{"title":"Lacunarity","summary":"Lacunarity, from the Latin lacuna, meaning \"gap\" or \"lake\", is a specialized term in geometry referring to a measure of how patterns, especially fractals, fill space, where patterns having more or larger gaps generally have higher lacunarity. Beyond being an intuitive measure of gappiness, lacunarity can quantify additional features of patterns such as \"rotational invariance\" and more generally, heterogeneity.[1][2][3] This is illustrated in Figure 1 showing three fractal patterns. When rotated 90Â°, the first two fairly homogeneous patterns do not appear to change, but the third more heterogeneous figure does change and has correspondingly higher lacunarity. The earliest reference to the term in geometry is usually attributed to Benoit Mandelbrot, who, in 1983 or perhaps as early as 1977, introduced it as, in essence, an adjunct to fractal analysis.[4] Lacunarity analysis is now used to characterize patterns in a wide variety of fields and has application in multifractal analysis[5][6] in particular (see Applications).","image":"Rotational_Invariance_Example.gif","url":"Lacunarity"}
