{"title":"BL (logic)","summary":"In mathematical logic, basic fuzzy logic (or shortly BL), the logic of the continuous t-norms, is one of the t-norm fuzzy logics. It belongs to the broader class of substructural logics, or logics of residuated lattices;[1] it extends the logic MTL of all left-continuous t-norms.","image":"53e574cc3aa5b4bf5f3f5906caf121a378eef08b.svg","url":"BL_(logic)"}
