{"title":"Finite-dimensional distribution","summary":"In mathematics, finite-dimensional distributions are a tool in the study of measures and stochastic processes. A lot of information can be gained by studying the \"projection\" of a measure (or process) onto a finite-dimensional vector space (or finite collection of times).","image":"2d1efec76d53b2977e284b7cf525c5ceffe299e3.svg","url":"Finite-dimensional_distribution"}
