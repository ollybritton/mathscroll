{"title":"Pollaczek–Khinchine formula","summary":"In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, the Pollaczek–Khinchine formula states a relationship between the queue length and service time distribution Laplace transforms for an M/G/1 queue (where jobs arrive according to a Poisson process and have general service time distribution). The term is also used to refer to the relationships between the mean queue length and mean waiting/service time in such a model.[1]","image":"d99a3d0ae26dcee7d04d637ff54f3b0837ae4ffd.svg","url":"Pollaczek–Khinchine_formula"}
