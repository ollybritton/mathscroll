{"title":"Asymmetry","summary":"Asymmetry is the absence of, or a violation of, symmetry (the property of an object being invariant to a transformation, such as reflection). Symmetry is an important property of both physical and abstract systems and it may be displayed in precise terms or in more aesthetic terms. The absence of or violation of symmetry that are either expected or desired can have important consequences for a system.","image":"Asymmetric_(PSF).svg.png.webp","url":"Asymmetry"}
