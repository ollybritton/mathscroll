{"title":"Pseudolikelihood","summary":"In statistical theory, a pseudolikelihood is an approximation to the  joint probability distribution of a collection of random variables. The practical use of this is that it can provide an approximation to the likelihood function of a set of observed data which may either provide a computationally simpler problem for estimation, or may provide a way of obtaining explicit estimates of model parameters.","image":"c3d2245165132e06cb858f27bdb8dd5656e63b4f.svg","url":"Pseudolikelihood"}
