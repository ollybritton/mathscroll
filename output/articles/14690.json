{"title":"Souček space","summary":"In mathematics, Souček spaces are generalizations of Sobolev spaces, named after the Czech mathematician Jiří Souček.  One of their main advantages is that they offer a way to deal with the fact that the Sobolev space W1,1 is not a reflexive space; since W1,1 is not reflexive, it is not always true that a bounded sequence has a weakly convergent subsequence, which is a desideratum in many applications.","image":"f014f54388d3dd25a8d2c60518f592b4330e5584.svg","url":"Souček_space"}
