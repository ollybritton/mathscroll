{"title":"Two-center bipolar coordinates","summary":"In mathematics, two-center bipolar coordinates is a coordinate system based on two coordinates which give distances from two fixed centers c 1 {\\displaystyle c_{1}} and c 2 {\\displaystyle c_{2}} .[1] This system is very useful in some scientific applications (e.g. calculating the electric field of a dipole on a plane).[2][3]","image":"77b7dc6d279091d354e0b90889b463bfa7eb7247.svg","url":"Two-center_bipolar_coordinates"}
