{"title":"k-minimum spanning tree","summary":"The k-minimum spanning tree problem, studied in theoretical computer science, asks for a tree of minimum cost that has exactly k vertices and forms a subgraph of a larger graph. It is also called the k-MST or edge-weighted k-cardinality tree. Finding this tree is NP-hard, but it can be approximated to within a constant approximation ratio in polynomial time.","image":"page1-220px-K-mst_1.pdf.jpg.webp","url":"K-minimum_spanning_tree"}
