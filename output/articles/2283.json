{"title":"Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks theorem is a theorem of Riemannian geometry, according to which the Riemannian metric is locally determined by the Riemann curvature tensor, or in other words, behavior of the curvature tensor under parallel translation determines the metric.","image":"30012178e674e69a55fee64e9c221dbdb0d95b9e.svg","url":"Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks_theorem"}
