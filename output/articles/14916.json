{"title":"Standard Model","summary":"The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions â€“ excluding gravity) in the universe and classifying all known elementary particles. It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists worldwide,[1] with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. Since then, proof of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy.","image":"Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg.png.webp","url":"Standard_Model"}
