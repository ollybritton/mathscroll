{"title":"Popoviciu's inequality on variances","summary":"In probability theory, Popoviciu's inequality, named after Tiberiu Popoviciu, is an upper bound on the variance Ïƒ2 of any bounded probability distribution.  Let M and m be upper and lower bounds on the values of any random variable with a particular probability distribution.  Then Popoviciu's inequality states:[1]","image":"5daec843bc022a3fb7de6613c90671395661cead.svg","url":"Popoviciu's_inequality_on_variances"}
