{"title":"Structural induction","summary":"Structural induction is a proof method that is used in mathematical logic (e.g., in the proof of Łoś' theorem), computer science, graph theory, and some other mathematical fields.  It is a generalization of mathematical induction over natural numbers and can be further generalized to arbitrary Noetherian induction.  Structural recursion is a recursion method bearing the same relationship to structural induction as ordinary recursion bears to ordinary mathematical induction.","image":"Waldburg_Ahnentafel.jpg.webp","url":"Structural_induction"}
