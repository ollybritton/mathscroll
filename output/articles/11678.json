{"title":"p-adic gamma function","summary":"In mathematics, the p-adic gamma function Γp is a function of a p-adic variable analogous to the gamma function. It was first explicitly defined by Morita (1975), though Boyarsky (1980) pointed out that Dwork (1964) implicitly used the same function. Diamond (1977) defined a p-adic analog Gp of log Γ. Overholtzer (1952) had previously given a definition of a different p-adic analogue of the gamma function, but his function does not have satisfactory properties and is not used much.","image":"dbc1df7227ef11fe88dccd2dae3adc7bbdeae5f4.svg","url":"P-adic_gamma_function"}
