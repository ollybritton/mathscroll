{"title":"Internal wave breaking","summary":"Internal wave breaking is a process during which internal gravity waves attain a large amplitude compared to their length scale, become nonlinearly unstable and finally break. This process is accompanied by turbulent dissipation and mixing. As internal gravity waves carry energy and momentum from the environment of their inception, breaking and subsequent turbulent mixing affects the fluid characteristics in locations of breaking. Consequently, internal wave breaking influences even the large scale flows and composition in both the ocean and the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, momentum deposition by internal wave breaking plays a key role in atmospheric phenomena such as the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and the Brewer-Dobson Circulation.[2] In the deep ocean, mixing induced by internal wave breaking is an important driver of the meridional overturning circulation.[3] On smaller scales, breaking-induced mixing is important for sediment transport and for nutrient supply to the photic zone.[4] Most breaking of oceanic internal waves occurs in continental shelves, well below the ocean surface, which makes it a difficult phenomenon to observe.","image":"Internal_wave_breaking_in_the_Rainbow_Ridge.jpg.webp","url":"Internal_wave_breaking"}
