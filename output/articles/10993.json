{"title":"Neighborhood semantics","summary":"Neighborhood semantics, also known as Scott–Montague semantics, is a formal semantics for modal logics.  It is a generalization, developed independently by Dana Scott and Richard Montague, of the more widely known relational semantics for modal logic.  Whereas a relational frame ⟨ W , R ⟩ {\\displaystyle \\langle W,R\\rangle } consists of a set W of worlds (or states) and an accessibility relation R intended to indicate which worlds are alternatives to (or, accessible from) others, a neighborhood frame ⟨ W , N ⟩ {\\displaystyle \\langle W,N\\rangle } still has a set W of worlds, but has instead of an accessibility relation a neighborhood function","image":"32eb216fc7104e751d3fb81d7bf61e570b0c5ad7.svg","url":"Neighborhood_semantics"}
