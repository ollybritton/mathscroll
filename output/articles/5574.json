{"title":"Ford–Fulkerson algorithm","summary":"The Ford–Fulkerson method or Ford–Fulkerson algorithm (FFA) is a greedy algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network. It is sometimes called a \"method\" instead of an \"algorithm\" as the approach to finding augmenting paths in a residual graph is not fully specified[1] or it is specified in several implementations with different running times.[2] It was published in 1956 by L. R. Ford Jr. and D. R. Fulkerson.[3] The name \"Ford–Fulkerson\" is often also used for the Edmonds–Karp algorithm, which is a fully defined implementation of the Ford–Fulkerson method.","image":"7dc43221ee885a10b87c89373b12b8c1110e7ca5.svg","url":"Ford–Fulkerson_algorithm"}
