{"title":"Gekko (optimization software)","summary":"The GEKKO Python package[1] solves large-scale mixed-integer and differential algebraic equations with nonlinear programming solvers (IPOPT, APOPT, BPOPT, SNOPT, MINOS). Modes of operation include machine learning, data reconciliation, real-time optimization, dynamic simulation, and nonlinear model predictive control. In addition, the package solves Linear programming (LP), Quadratic programming (QP), Quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), Nonlinear programming (NLP), Mixed integer programming (MIP), and Mixed integer linear programming (MILP). GEKKO is available in Python and installed with pip from PyPI of the Python Software Foundation.","image":"Gekko_logo.png.webp","url":"Gekko_(optimization_software)"}
