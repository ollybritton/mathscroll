{"title":"600-cell","summary":"In geometry, the 600-cell is the convex regular 4-polytope (four-dimensional analogue of a Platonic solid) with Schl√§fli symbol {3,3,5}. It is also known as the C600, hexacosichoron[1] and hexacosihedroid.[2] It is also called a tetraplex (abbreviated from \"tetrahedral complex\") and a polytetrahedron, being bounded by tetrahedral cells.","image":"Schlegel_wireframe_600-cell_vertex-centered.png.webp","url":"600-cell"}
