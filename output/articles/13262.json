{"title":"Redundant proof","summary":"In mathematical logic, a redundant proof is a proof that has a subset that is a shorter proof of the same result. In other words, a proof is redundant if it has more proof steps than are actually necessary to prove the result. Formally, a proof ψ {\\displaystyle \\psi } of κ {\\displaystyle \\kappa } is considered redundant if there exists another proof ψ ′ {\\displaystyle \\psi ^{\\prime }} of κ ′ {\\displaystyle \\kappa ^{\\prime }} such that κ ′ ⊆ κ {\\displaystyle \\kappa ^{\\prime }\\subseteq \\kappa } (i.e. κ ′ subsumes κ {\\displaystyle \\kappa ^{\\prime }\\;{\\text{subsumes}}\\;\\kappa } ) and | ψ ′ | < | ψ | {\\displaystyle |\\psi ^{\\prime }|<|\\psi |} where | φ | {\\displaystyle |\\varphi |} is the number of nodes in φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } .[1]","image":"45e5789e5d9c8f7c79744f43ecaaf8ba42a8553a.svg","url":"Redundant_proof"}
