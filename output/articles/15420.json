{"title":"System of bilinear equations","summary":"In mathematics, a system of bilinear equations is a special sort of system of polynomial equations, where each equation equates a bilinear form with a constant (possibly zero). More precisely, given two sets of variables represented as coordinate vectors x and y, then each equation of the system can be written","image":"b917e0760c9f38aab7e48d07d754801bb65d33f6.svg","url":"System_of_bilinear_equations"}
