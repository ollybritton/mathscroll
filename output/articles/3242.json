{"title":"Connection (fibred manifold)","summary":"In differential geometry, a fibered manifold is surjective submersion of smooth manifolds Y â†’ X. Locally trivial fibered manifolds are fiber bundles. Therefore, a notion of connection on fibered manifolds provides a general framework of a connection on fiber bundles.","image":"cdf16a6aef146a52ee4458f03390709d930a3c91.svg","url":"Connection_(fibred_manifold)"}
