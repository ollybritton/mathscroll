{"title":"Phase-field model","summary":"A phase-field model is a mathematical model for solving interfacial problems. It has mainly been applied to solidification dynamics,[1] but it has also been applied to other situations such as viscous fingering,[2] fracture mechanics,[3][4][5][6] hydrogen embrittlement,[7] and vesicle dynamics.[8][9][10][11]","image":"Phase_field_order_parameter.jpg.webp","url":"Phase-field_model"}
