{"title":"Bounded set","summary":"In mathematical analysis and related areas of mathematics, a set is called bounded if it is, in a certain sense, of finite measure. Conversely, a set which is not bounded is called unbounded. The word \"bounded\" makes no sense in a general topological space without a corresponding metric.","image":"Bounded_unbounded.svg.png.webp","url":"Bounded_set"}
