{"title":"Applied category theory","summary":"Applied category theory is an academic discipline in which methods from category theory are used to study other fields[1][2][3] including but not limited to computer science,[4][5] physics (in particular quantum mechanics[6][7][8][9]), natural language processing,[10][11][12] control theory,[13][14][15] probability theory and causality. The application of category theory in these domains can take different forms. In some cases the formalization of the domain into the language of category theory is the goal, the idea here being that this would elucidate the important structure and properties of the domain. In other cases the formalization is used to leverage the power of abstraction in order to prove new results about the field.","image":"Commutative_diagram_for_morphism.svg.png.webp","url":"Applied_category_theory"}
