{"title":"Minkowski–Bouligand dimension","summary":"In fractal geometry, the Minkowski–Bouligand dimension, also known as Minkowski dimension or box-counting dimension, is a way of determining the fractal dimension of a set S {\\displaystyle S} in a Euclidean space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} , or more generally in a metric space ( X , d ) {\\displaystyle (X,d)} . It is named after the Polish mathematician Hermann Minkowski and the French mathematician Georges Bouligand.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Minkowski–Bouligand_dimension"}
