{"title":"Poincaré separation theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Poincaré separation theorem, also known as the Cauchy interlacing theorem,[1] gives some upper and lower bounds of eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix B'AB that can be considered as the orthogonal projection of a larger real symmetric matrix A onto a linear subspace spanned by the columns of B.  The theorem is named after Henri Poincaré.","image":"72fde940918edf84caf3d406cc7d31949166820f.svg","url":"Poincaré_separation_theorem"}
