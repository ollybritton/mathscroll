{"title":"Locally compact abelian group","summary":"In several mathematical areas, including harmonic analysis, topology, and number theory, locally compact abelian groups are abelian groups which have a particularly convenient topology on them. For example, the group of integers (equipped with the discrete topology), or the real numbers or the circle (both with their usual topology) are locally compact abelian groups.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Locally_compact_abelian_group"}
