{"title":"Darboux's formula","summary":"In mathematical analysis, Darboux's formula is a formula introduced by  Gaston Darboux (1876) for summing infinite series by using integrals or evaluating integrals using infinite series. It is a generalization to the complex plane of the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula, which is used for similar purposes and derived in a similar manner (by repeated integration by parts of a particular choice of integrand). Darboux's formula can also be used to derive the Taylor series from calculus.","image":"8f04ed7553d043805c21d03f660dc6425c34886c.svg","url":"Darboux's_formula"}
