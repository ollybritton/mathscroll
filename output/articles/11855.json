{"title":"Partition matroid","summary":"In mathematics, a partition matroid or partitional matroid is a matroid that is a direct sum of uniform matroids.[1] It is defined over a base set in which the elements are partitioned into different categories. For each category, there is a capacity constraint - a maximum number of allowed elements from this category. The independent sets of a partition matroid are exactly the sets in which, for each category, the number of elements from this category is at most the category capacity.","image":"cc49dc02c0ec8c86b67e7d10518ac791eda0bf22.svg","url":"Partition_matroid"}
