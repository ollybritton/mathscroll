{"title":"Arrangement of hyperplanes","summary":"In geometry and combinatorics, an arrangement of hyperplanes is an arrangement of a finite set A of hyperplanes in a linear, affine, or projective space S. Questions about a hyperplane arrangement A generally concern geometrical, topological, or other properties of the complement, M(A), which is the set that remains when the hyperplanes are removed from the whole space.  One may ask how these properties are related to the arrangement and its intersection semilattice. The intersection semilattice of A, written L(A), is the set of all subspaces that are obtained by intersecting some of the hyperplanes; among these subspaces are S itself, all the individual hyperplanes, all intersections of pairs of hyperplanes, etc. (excluding, in the affine case, the empty set).  These intersection subspaces of A are also called the flats of A.  The intersection semilattice L(A) is partially ordered by reverse inclusion.","image":"Arrangement_hyperplans.png.webp","url":"Arrangement_of_hyperplanes"}
