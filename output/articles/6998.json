{"title":"Heine–Cantor theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Heine–Cantor theorem, named after Eduard Heine and Georg Cantor, states that if f : M → N {\\displaystyle f\\colon M\\to N} is a continuous function between two metric spaces M {\\displaystyle M} and N {\\displaystyle N} , and M {\\displaystyle M} is compact, then f {\\displaystyle f} is uniformly continuous. An important special case is that every continuous function from a closed bounded interval to the real numbers is uniformly continuous.","image":"26c86d8613d6babf1a7cd6dd5909a3b480840c56.svg","url":"Heine–Cantor_theorem"}
