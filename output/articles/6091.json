{"title":"Generalized semi-infinite programming","summary":"In mathematics, a semi-infinite programming (SIP) problem is an optimization problem with a finite number of variables and an infinite number of constraints. The constraints are typically parameterized. In a generalized semi-infinite programming (GSIP) problem, the feasible set of the parameters depends on the variables.[1]","image":"ca3894ab942944b2be1fb33ad2790f57ccf22fff.svg","url":"Generalized_semi-infinite_programming"}
