{"title":"Self-verifying theories","summary":"Self-verifying theories are consistent first-order systems of arithmetic, much weaker than Peano arithmetic, that are capable of proving their own consistency. Dan Willard was the first to investigate their properties, and he has described a family of such systems.  According to GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem, these systems cannot contain the theory of Peano arithmetic nor its weak fragment Robinson arithmetic; nonetheless, they can contain strong theorems.","image":"0d58b0d35851996c3e8fa2ed4b5f4c583a3337df.svg","url":"Self-verifying_theories"}
