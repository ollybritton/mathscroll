{"title":"P (complexity)","summary":"In computational complexity theory, P, also known as PTIME or DTIME(nO(1)), is a fundamental complexity class. It contains all decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a polynomial amount of computation time, or polynomial time.","image":"58cae53cd06109e13488c083715309059a09ad83.svg","url":"P_(complexity)"}
