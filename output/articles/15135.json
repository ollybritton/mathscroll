{"title":"String group","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, a string group is an infinite-dimensional group String ‚Å° ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {String} (n)} introduced by Stolz (1996) as a 3 {\\displaystyle 3} -connected cover of a spin group. A string manifold is a manifold with a lifting of its frame bundle to a string group bundle. This means that in addition to being able to define holonomy along paths, one can also define holonomies for surfaces going between strings. There is a short exact sequence of topological groups","image":"c1202a8296407ac2858a7c3dacab0144c1b97136.svg","url":"String_group"}
