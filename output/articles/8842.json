{"title":"Krivine–Stengle Positivstellensatz","summary":"In real algebraic geometry, Krivine–Stengle Positivstellensatz (German for \"positive-locus-theorem\") characterizes polynomials that are positive on a semialgebraic set, which is defined by systems of inequalities of polynomials with real coefficients, or more generally, coefficients from any real closed field.","image":"13e8ba5e012afbcaada217788facce0683c3c07a.svg","url":"Krivine–Stengle_Positivstellensatz"}
