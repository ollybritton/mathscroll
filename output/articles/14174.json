{"title":"Sequence space","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, a sequence space is a vector space whose elements are infinite sequences of real or complex numbers. Equivalently, it is a function space whose elements are functions from the natural numbers to the field K of real or complex numbers.  The set of all such functions is naturally  identified with the set of all possible infinite sequences with elements in K, and can be turned into a vector space under the operations of pointwise addition of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication. All sequence spaces are linear subspaces of this space.  Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a norm, or at least the structure of a topological vector space.","image":"fd9c43a7e4e79e6ba366179cbac0f9637a19f8f5.svg","url":"Sequence_space"}
