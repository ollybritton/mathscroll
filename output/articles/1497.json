{"title":"Bernoulli umbra","summary":"In Umbral calculus, Bernoulli umbra B − {\\displaystyle B_{-}} is an umbra, a formal symbol, defined by the relation eval ⁡ B − n = B n − {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {eval} B_{-}^{n}=B_{n}^{-}} , where eval {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {eval} } is the index-lowering operator,[1] also known as evaluation operator [2] and B n − {\\displaystyle B_{n}^{-}} are Bernoulli numbers, called moments of the umbra.[3] A similar umbra, defined as eval ⁡ B + n = B n + {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {eval} B_{+}^{n}=B_{n}^{+}} , where B 1 + = 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle B_{1}^{+}=1/2} is also often used and sometimes called Bernoulli umbra as well. They are related by equality B + = B − + 1 {\\displaystyle B_{+}=B_{-}+1} . Along with the Euler umbra, Bernoulli umbra is one of the most important umbras.","image":"ebd620a2a35e8ce6f89031c3f139f0c49f62517d.svg","url":"Bernoulli_umbra"}
