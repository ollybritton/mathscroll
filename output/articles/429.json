{"title":"Affine focal set","summary":"In mathematics, and especially affine differential geometry, the affine focal set of a smooth submanifold M embedded in a smooth manifold N is the caustic generated by the affine normal lines. It can be realised as the bifurcation set of a certain family of functions. The bifurcation set is the set of parameter values of the family which yield functions with degenerate singularities. This is not the same as the bifurcation diagram in dynamical systems.","image":"c1caefb347c86337ea7cd0c354acd2294bd7d81d.svg","url":"Affine_focal_set"}
