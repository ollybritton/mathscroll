{"title":"Fractional Fourier transform","summary":"In mathematics, in the area of harmonic analysis, the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is a family of linear transformations generalizing the Fourier transform. It can be thought of as the Fourier transform to the n-th power, where n need not be an integer â€” thus, it can transform a function to any intermediate domain between time and frequency. Its applications range from filter design and signal analysis to phase retrieval and pattern recognition.","image":"205d4b91000d9dcf1a5bbabdfa6a8395fa60b676.svg","url":"Fractional_Fourier_transform"}
