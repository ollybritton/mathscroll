{"title":"B-convex space","summary":"In functional analysis, the class of B-convex spaces is a class of Banach space.  The concept of B-convexity was defined and used to characterize Banach spaces that have the strong law of large numbers by Anatole Beck in 1962;  accordingly, \"B-convexity\" is understood as an abbreviation of Beck convexity.  Beck proved the following theorem: A Banach space is B-convex if and only if every sequence of independent, symmetric, uniformly bounded and Radon random variables in that space satisfies the strong law of large numbers.","image":"c9e38a59c9c487f73f7a833a8f69826a4e0e9471.svg","url":"B-convex_space"}
