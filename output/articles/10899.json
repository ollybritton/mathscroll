{"title":"NP-hardness","summary":"In computational complexity theory, NP-hardness (non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness) is the defining property of a class of problems that are informally \"at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP\". A simple example of an NP-hard problem is the subset sum problem.","image":"P_np_np-complete_np-hard.svg.png.webp","url":"NP-hardness"}
