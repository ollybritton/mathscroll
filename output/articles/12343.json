{"title":"Polynomial functor (type theory)","summary":"In type theory, a polynomial functor (or container functor) is a kind of endofunctor of a category of types that is intimately related to the concept of inductive and coinductive types. Specifically, all W-types (resp. M-types) are (isomorphic to) initial algebras (resp. final coalgebras) of such functors.","image":"06dff3a8c1966c543e0f7fa69a915385d4ed180d.svg","url":"Polynomial_functor_(type_theory)"}
