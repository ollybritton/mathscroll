{"title":"Runcic 5-cubes","summary":"In six-dimensional geometry, a runcic 5-cube or (runcic 5-demicube, runcihalf 5-cube) is a convex uniform 5-polytope. There are 2 runcic forms for the 5-cube. Runcic 5-cubes have half the vertices of runcinated 5-cubes.","image":"5-cube_t0.svg.png.webp","url":"Runcic_5-cubes"}
