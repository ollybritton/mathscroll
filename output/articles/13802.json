{"title":"Runge–Kutta methods","summary":"In numerical analysis, the Runge–Kutta methods (English: /ˈrʊŋəˈkʊtɑː/ (listen) RUUNG-ə-KUUT-tah[1]) are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods, which include the Euler method, used in temporal discretization for the approximate solutions of simultaneous nonlinear equations.[2] These methods were developed around 1900 by the German mathematicians Carl Runge and Wilhelm Kutta.","image":"Runge-kutta.svg.png.webp","url":"Runge–Kutta_methods"}
