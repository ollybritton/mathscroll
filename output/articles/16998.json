{"title":"Wirtinger inequality (2-forms)","summary":"In mathematics, the Wirtinger inequality, named after Wilhelm Wirtinger, is a fundamental result in complex linear algebra which relates the symplectic and volume forms of a hermitian inner product. It has important consequences in complex geometry, such as showing that the normalized exterior powers of the Kähler form of a Kähler manifold are calibrations.","image":"b946a8a66eaad20c3e7e3837c84e8261206d2b39.svg","url":"Wirtinger_inequality_(2-forms)"}
