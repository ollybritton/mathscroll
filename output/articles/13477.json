{"title":"Rhombitetrahexagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the rhombitetrahexagonal tiling is a uniform tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It has Schl√§fli symbol of rr{6,4}. It can be seen as constructed as a rectified tetrahexagonal tiling, r{6,4}, as well as an expanded order-4 hexagonal tiling or expanded order-6 square tiling.","image":"H2_tiling_246-5.png.webp","url":"Rhombitetrahexagonal_tiling"}
