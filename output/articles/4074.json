{"title":"Differentiable stack","summary":"A differentiable stack is the analogue in differential geometry of an algebraic stack in algebraic geometry. It can be described either as a stack over differentiable manifolds which admits an atlas, or as a Lie groupoid up to Morita equivalence.[1]","image":"e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019.svg","url":"Differentiable_stack"}
