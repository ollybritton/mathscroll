{"title":"Conditional expectation","summary":"In probability theory, the conditional expectation, conditional expected value, or conditional mean of a random variable is its expected value – the value it would take “on average” over an arbitrarily large number of occurrences – given that a certain set of \"conditions\" is known to occur. If the random variable can take on only a finite number of values, the “conditions” are that the variable can only take on a subset of those values. More formally, in the case when the random variable is defined over a discrete probability space, the \"conditions\" are a partition of this probability space.","image":"d8a3673ffaed23ba984c59d34674e53bde937172.svg","url":"Conditional_expectation"}
