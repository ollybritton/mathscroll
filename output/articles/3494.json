{"title":"Courant algebroid","summary":"In a field of mathematics known as differential geometry, a Courant geometry was originally introduced by Zhang-Ju Liu, Alan Weinstein and Ping Xu in their investigation of doubles of Lie bialgebroids in 1997.[1] Liu, Weinstein and Xu named it after Courant, who had implicitly devised earlier in 1990[2] the standard prototype of Courant algebroid through his discovery of a skew symmetric bracket on T M ⊕ T ∗ M {\\displaystyle TM\\oplus T^{*}M} , called Courant bracket today, which fails to satisfy the Jacobi identity. Both this standard example and the double of a Lie bialgebra are special instances of Courant algebroids.","image":"d1cd8496f5529f5ba4e61a2434e9c12b5b3bd4b7.svg","url":"Courant_algebroid"}
