{"title":"Differential game","summary":"In game theory, differential games are a group of problems related to the modeling and analysis of conflict in the context of a dynamical system.  More specifically, a state variable or variables evolve over time according to a differential equation.  Early analyses reflected military interests, considering two actors—the pursuer and the evader—with diametrically opposed goals.  More recent analyses have reflected engineering or economic considerations.[1][2]","image":"b375df3b65d282f8715835dc91ccb22f46993959.svg","url":"Differential_game"}
