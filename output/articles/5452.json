{"title":"Finite sphere packing","summary":"In mathematics, the theory of finite sphere packing concerns the question of how a finite number of equally-sized spheres can be most efficiently packed. The question of packing finitely many spheres has only been investigated in detail in recent decades, with much of the groundwork being laid by László Fejes Tóth.","image":"Sausage_packing.svg.png.webp","url":"Finite_sphere_packing"}
