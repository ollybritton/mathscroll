{"title":"One-way wave equation","summary":"A one-way wave equation is a first-order partial differential equation describing one wave traveling in a direction defined by the vector wave velocity. It contrasts with the second-order two-way wave equation describing a standing wavefield resulting from superposition of two waves in opposite directions.[1][2][3] In the one-dimensional case, the one-way wave equation allows wave propagation to be calculated without the mathematical complication of solving a 2nd order differential equation. Due to the fact that in the last decades no 3D one-way wave equation could be found numerous approximation methods based on the 1D one-way wave equation are used for 3D seismic and other geophysical calculations, see also the section § Three-dimensional case.[4][5][1] [6]","image":"6f3ad777d0973931376adc6c0f20df29ccb5cbe7.svg","url":"One-way_wave_equation"}
