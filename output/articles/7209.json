{"title":"Higman group","summary":"In mathematics, the Higman group, introduced by Graham HigmanÂ (1951), was the first example of an infinite finitely presented group with no non-trivial finite quotients. The quotient by the maximal proper normal subgroup is a finitely generated infinite simple group. Higman (1974) later found some finitely presented infinite  groups Gn,r that are simple if n is even and have a simple subgroup of index 2 if n is odd, one of which is one of the Thompson groups.","image":"5191cfcf0c92d7902c282a919679d1824145be30.svg","url":"Higman_group"}
