{"title":"Adversarial queueing network","summary":"In queueing theory, an adversarial queueing network is a model where the traffic to the network is supplied by an opponent rather than as the result of a stochastic process. The model has seen use in describing the impact of packet injections on the performance of communication networks.[1] The model was first introduced in 1996.[2]","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Adversarial_queueing_network"}
