{"title":"Constant sheaf","summary":"In mathematics, the constant sheaf on a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} associated to a set A {\\displaystyle A} is a sheaf of sets on X {\\displaystyle X} whose stalks are all equal to A {\\displaystyle A} . It is denoted by A _ {\\displaystyle {\\underline {A}}} or A X {\\displaystyle A_{X}} . The constant presheaf with value A {\\displaystyle A} is the presheaf that assigns to each non-empty open subset of X {\\displaystyle X} the value A {\\displaystyle A} , and  all of whose restriction maps are the identity map A â†’ A {\\displaystyle A\\to A} . The constant sheaf associated to A {\\displaystyle A} is the sheafification of the constant presheaf associated to A {\\displaystyle A} . This sheaf identifies with the sheaf of locally constant A {\\displaystyle A} -valued functions on X {\\displaystyle X} .[1]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Constant_sheaf"}
