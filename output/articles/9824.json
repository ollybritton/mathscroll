{"title":"Maass wave form","summary":"In mathematics, Maass forms or Maass wave forms are studied in the theory of automorphic forms. Maass forms are complex-valued smooth functions of the upper half plane, which transform in a similar way under the operation of a discrete subgroup Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } of S L 2 ( R ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {SL} _{2}(\\mathbb {R} )} as modular forms. They are Eigenforms of the hyperbolic Laplace Operator Δ {\\displaystyle \\Delta } defined on H {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} } and satisfy certain growth conditions at the cusps of a fundamental domain of Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } . In contrast to the modular forms the Maass forms need not be holomorphic. They were studied first by Hans Maass in 1949.","image":"4cfde86a3f7ec967af9955d0988592f0693d2b19.svg","url":"Maass_wave_form"}
