{"title":"Sliding DFT","summary":"In applied mathematics, the sliding discrete Fourier transform is a recursive algorithm to compute successive STFTs of input data frames that are a single sample apart (hopsize − 1).[1] The calculation for the sliding DFT is closely related to Goertzel algorithm.","image":"9133b40acec2ced812b009e296b73530526261ab.svg","url":"Sliding_DFT"}
