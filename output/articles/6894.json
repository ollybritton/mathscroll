{"title":"Harish-Chandra's Schwartz space","summary":"In mathematical abstract harmonic analysis, Harish-Chandra's Schwartz space is a space of functions on a semisimple Lie group whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing, studied by Harish-Chandra (1966, section 9). It is an analogue of the Schwartz space on a real vector space, and is used to define the space of tempered distributions on a semisimple Lie group.","image":"74dd4bb35cdc1e6500314ae8962e94dec85fa08c.svg","url":"Harish-Chandra's_Schwartz_space"}
