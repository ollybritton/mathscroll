{"title":"Acute and obtuse triangles","summary":"An acute triangle (or acute-angled triangle) is a triangle with three acute angles (less than 90°). An obtuse triangle (or obtuse-angled triangle) is a triangle with one obtuse angle (greater than 90°) and two acute angles. Since a triangle's angles must sum to 180° in Euclidean geometry, no Euclidean triangle can have more than one obtuse angle.","image":"Triangle.Right.svg.png.webp","url":"Acute_and_obtuse_triangles"}
