{"title":"Descriptive geometry","summary":"Descriptive geometry is the branch of geometry which allows the representation of three-dimensional objects in two dimensions by using a specific set of procedures. The resulting techniques are important for engineering, architecture, design and in art.[1]   The theoretical basis for descriptive geometry is provided by planar geometric projections.  The earliest known publication on the technique was \"Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt\", published in Linien, Nuremberg: 1525, by Albrecht Dürer. Italian architect Guarino Guarini was also a pioneer of projective and descriptive geometry, as is clear from his Placita Philosophica (1665), Euclides Adauctus (1671) and Architettura Civile (1686—not published until 1737), anticipating the work of Gaspard Monge (1746–1818), who is usually credited with the invention of descriptive geometry.[2][3] Gaspard Monge is usually considered the \"father of descriptive geometry\" due to his developments in geometric problem solving. His first discoveries were in 1765 while he was working as a draftsman for military fortifications, although his findings were published later on.[4]","image":"DALLA.GIF","url":"Descriptive_geometry"}
