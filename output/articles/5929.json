{"title":"Gallai–Edmonds decomposition","summary":"In graph theory, the Gallai–Edmonds decomposition is a partition of the vertices of a graph into three subsets which provides information on the structure of maximum matchings in the graph. Tibor Gallai[1][2] and Jack Edmonds[3] independently discovered it and proved its key properties.","image":"Gallai–Edmonds_decomposition.svg.png.webp","url":"Gallai–Edmonds_decomposition"}
