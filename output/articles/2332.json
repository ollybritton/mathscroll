{"title":"Categorification","summary":"In mathematics, categorification is the process of replacing set-theoretic theorems with category-theoretic analogues. Categorification, when done successfully, replaces sets with categories, functions with functors, and equations with natural isomorphisms of functors satisfying additional properties.  The term was coined by Louis Crane.","image":"b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a.svg","url":"Categorification"}
