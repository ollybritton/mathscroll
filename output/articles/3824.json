{"title":"De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem relates graph coloring of an infinite graph to the same problem on its finite subgraphs. It states that, when all finite subgraphs can be colored with c {\\displaystyle c} colors, the same is true for the whole graph. The theorem was proved by Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn and Paul Erdős (1951), after whom it is named.","image":"86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455.svg","url":"De_Bruijn–Erdős_theorem_(graph_theory)"}
