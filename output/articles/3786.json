{"title":"Daubechies wavelet","summary":"The Daubechies wavelets, based on the work of Ingrid Daubechies, are a family of orthogonal wavelets defining a discrete wavelet transform and characterized by a maximal number of vanishing moments for some given support. With each wavelet type of this class, there is a scaling function (called the father wavelet) which generates an orthogonal multiresolution analysis.","image":"Daubechies20LowPassHighPass2DFilterM.png.webp","url":"Daubechies_wavelet"}
