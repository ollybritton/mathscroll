{"title":"Halin graph","summary":"In graph theory, a Halin graph is a type of planar graph, constructed by connecting the leaves of a tree  into a cycle. The tree must have at least four vertices, none of which has exactly two neighbors; it should be drawn in the plane so none of its edges cross (this is called a planar embedding), and the cycle connects the leaves in their clockwise ordering in this embedding. Thus, the cycle forms the outer face of the Halin graph, with the tree inside it.[1]","image":"Halin_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Halin_graph"}
