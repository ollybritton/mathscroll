{"title":"Algebraic graph theory","summary":"Algebraic graph theory is a branch of mathematics in which algebraic methods are applied to problems about graphs. This is in contrast to geometric, combinatoric, or algorithmic approaches.  There are three main branches of algebraic graph theory, involving the use of linear algebra, the use of group theory, and the study of graph invariants.","image":"Petersen1_tiny.svg.png.webp","url":"Algebraic_graph_theory"}
