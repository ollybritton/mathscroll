{"title":"Graph cuts in computer vision","summary":"As applied in the field of computer vision, graph cut optimization can be employed to efficiently solve a wide variety of low-level computer vision problems (early vision[1]), such as image smoothing, the stereo correspondence problem, image segmentation, object co-segmentation, and many other computer vision problems that can be formulated in terms of energy minimization.  Many of these energy minimization problems can be approximated by solving a maximum flow problem in a graph[2] (and thus, by the max-flow min-cut theorem, define a minimal cut of the graph).  Under most formulations of such problems in computer vision, the minimum energy solution corresponds to the maximum a posteriori estimate of a solution.  Although many computer vision algorithms involve cutting a graph (e.g., normalized cuts), the term \"graph cuts\" is applied specifically to those models which employ a max-flow/min-cut optimization (other graph cutting algorithms may be considered as graph partitioning algorithms).","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Graph_cuts_in_computer_vision"}
