{"title":"Plurisubharmonic function","summary":"In mathematics, plurisubharmonic functions  (sometimes abbreviated as psh, plsh, or plush functions) form an important class of functions used in complex analysis. On a KÃ¤hler manifold, plurisubharmonic functions form a subset of the subharmonic functions. However, unlike subharmonic functions (which are defined on a Riemannian manifold) plurisubharmonic functions can be defined in full generality on complex analytic spaces.","image":"835c829aa7b00e09dcc0c1fd603df4c604098acb.svg","url":"Plurisubharmonic_function"}
