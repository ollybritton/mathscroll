{"title":"Tannakian formalism","summary":"In mathematics, a Tannakian category is a particular kind of monoidal category C, equipped with some extra structure relative to a given field K. The role of such categories C is to approximate, in some sense, the category of linear representations of an algebraic group G defined over K. A number of major applications of the theory have been made, or might be made in pursuit of some of the central conjectures of contemporary algebraic geometry and number theory.","image":"e4ed21b6db80d0900630455bac72c3727ed07f5e.svg","url":"Tannakian_formalism"}
