{"title":"Joseph Plateau","summary":"Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau (14 October 1801 â€“ 15 September 1883) was a Belgian physicist and mathematician. He was one of the first people to demonstrate the illusion of a moving image.[2] To do this, he used counterrotating disks with repeating drawn images in small increments of motion on one and regularly spaced slits in the other. He called this device of 1832 the phenakistiscope.","image":"Joseph_Plateau_-_clean.jpg.webp","url":"Joseph_Plateau"}
