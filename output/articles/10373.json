{"title":"Metric differential","summary":"In mathematical analysis, a metric differential is a generalization of a derivative for a Lipschitz continuous function defined on a Euclidean space and taking values in an arbitrary metric space. With this definition of a derivative, one can generalize Rademacher's theorem to metric space-valued Lipschitz functions.","image":"deecf2a0088a72ab6aeb30c3a4e346658bf3c34a.svg","url":"Metric_differential"}
