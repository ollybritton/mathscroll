{"title":"Strict 2-category","summary":"In category theory, a strict 2-category is a category with \"morphisms between morphisms\", that is, where each hom-set itself carries the structure of a category.   It can be formally defined as a category enriched over Cat (the category of categories and functors, with the monoidal structure given by product of categories).","image":"71321910d2547fb660523682add481bd5ebd2b34.svg","url":"Strict_2-category"}
