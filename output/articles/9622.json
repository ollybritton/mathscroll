{"title":"Localized Chern class","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a localized Chern class is a variant of a Chern class, that is defined for a chain complex of vector bundles as opposed to a single vector bundle. It was originally introduced in Fulton's intersection theory,[1] as an algebraic counterpart of the similar construction in algebraic topology. The notion is used in particular in the Riemannâ€“Roch-type theorem.","image":"941a4fe23e8dc4f0218d49071448dd96c35dcb1c.svg","url":"Localized_Chern_class"}
