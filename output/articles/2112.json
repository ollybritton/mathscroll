{"title":"CLs method (particle physics)","summary":"In particle physics, CLs[1] represents a statistical method for setting upper limits (also called exclusion limits[2]) on model parameters, a particular form of interval estimation used for parameters that can take only non-negative values. Although CLs are said to refer to Confidence Levels, \"The method's name is ... misleading, as the CLs exclusion region is not a confidence interval.\"[3] It was first introduced by physicists working at the LEP experiment at CERN and has since been used by many high energy physics experiments. It is a frequentist method in the sense that the properties of the limit are defined by means of error probabilities, however it differs from standard confidence intervals in that the stated confidence level of the interval is not equal to its coverage probability. The reason for this deviation is that standard upper limits based on a most powerful test necessarily produce empty intervals with some fixed probability when the parameter value is zero, and this property is considered undesirable by most physicists and statisticians.[4]","image":"369d0250ab664963a819eb7e3757303a315874cd.svg","url":"CLs_method_(particle_physics)"}
