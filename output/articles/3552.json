{"title":"Critical exponent of a word","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, the critical exponent of a finite or infinite sequence of symbols over a finite alphabet describes the largest number of times a contiguous subsequence can be repeated.  For example, the critical exponent of \"Mississippi\" is 7/3, as it contains the string \"ississi\", which is of length 7 and period 3.","image":"20795664b5b048744a2fd88977851104cc5816f8.svg","url":"Critical_exponent_of_a_word"}
