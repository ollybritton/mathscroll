{"title":"Turán graph","summary":"The Turán graph, denoted by T ( n , r ) {\\displaystyle T(n,r)} , is a complete multipartite graph; it is formed by partitioning a set of n {\\displaystyle n} vertices into r {\\displaystyle r} subsets, with sizes as equal as possible, and then connecting two vertices by an edge if and only if they belong to different subsets. Where q {\\displaystyle q} and s {\\displaystyle s} are the quotient and remainder of dividing n {\\displaystyle n} by r {\\displaystyle r} (so n = q r + s {\\displaystyle n=qr+s} ), the graph is of the form K q + 1 , q + 1 , … , q , q {\\displaystyle K_{q+1,q+1,\\ldots ,q,q}} , and the number of edges is","image":"251a0adbabadb36b30d6a572af9ce2de18f9e4f5.svg","url":"Turán_graph"}
