{"title":"Differential structure","summary":"In mathematics, an n-dimensional differential structure (or differentiable structure) on a set M makes M into an n-dimensional differential manifold, which is a topological manifold with some additional structure that allows for differential calculus on the manifold. If M is already a topological manifold, it is required that the new topology be identical to the existing one.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Differential_structure"}
