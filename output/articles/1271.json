{"title":"Baire space","summary":"In mathematics, a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} is said to be a Baire space if countable unions of closed sets with empty interior also have empty interior.[1] According to the Baire category theorem, compact Hausdorff spaces and complete metric spaces are examples of Baire spaces. The Baire category theorem combined with the properties of Baire spaces has numerous applications in topology, geometry, analysis, in particular functional analysis.[2][3] For more motivation and applications, see the article Baire category theorem.  The current article focuses more on characterizations and basic properties of Baire spaces per se.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Baire_space"}
