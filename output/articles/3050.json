{"title":"Compound Poisson distribution","summary":"In probability theory, a compound Poisson distribution is the probability distribution of the sum of a number of independent identically-distributed random variables, where the number of terms to be added is itself a Poisson-distributed variable. The result can be either a continuous or a discrete distribution.","image":"a4bbbaef05b6ebdc023b8e2bf34bf4551e469131.svg","url":"Compound_Poisson_distribution"}
