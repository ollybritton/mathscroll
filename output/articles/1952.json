{"title":"Brauer algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Brauer algebra is an associative algebra introduced by Richard Brauer[1] in the context of the representation theory of the orthogonal group. It plays the same role that the symmetric group does for the representation theory of the general linear group in Schurâ€“Weyl duality.","image":"5d3dc25e9b6b5283645fb37db4742333b1ffec1a.svg","url":"Brauer_algebra"}
