{"title":"Abel elliptic functions","summary":"In mathematics Abel elliptic functions are a special kind of elliptic functions, that were established by the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. He published his paper \"Recherches sur les Fonctions elliptiques\" in Crelle's Journal in 1827.[1] It was the first work on elliptic functions that was actually published.[2] Abel's work on elliptic functions also influenced Jacobi's studies of elliptic functions, whose 1829 published book \"Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum\" became the standard work on elliptic functions.[3]","image":"1857c9164f2baafb5a0795bbaf2a4da2fa16a74a.svg","url":"Abel_elliptic_functions"}
