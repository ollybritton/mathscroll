{"title":"Abstraction (mathematics)","summary":"Abstraction in mathematics is the process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns or properties of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.[1][2][3] Two of the most highly abstract areas of modern mathematics are category theory and model theory.","image":"Wikiquote-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Abstraction_(mathematics)"}
