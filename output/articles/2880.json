{"title":"Colombeau algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Colombeau algebra is an algebra of a certain kind containing the space of Schwartz distributions. While in classical distribution theory a general multiplication of distributions is not possible, Colombeau algebras provide a rigorous framework for this.","image":"0c6458e02dc188eddc958cccc1ee60a3aef6370b.svg","url":"Colombeau_algebra"}
