{"title":"Baire category theorem","summary":"The Baire category theorem (BCT) is an important result in general topology and functional analysis. The theorem has two forms, each of which gives sufficient conditions for a topological space to be a Baire space (a topological space such that the intersection of countably many dense open sets is still dense).  It is used in the proof of results in many areas of analysis and geometry, including some of the fundamental theorems of functional analysis.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Baire_category_theorem"}
