{"title":"Fundamental lemma (Langlands program)","summary":"In the mathematical theory of automorphic forms, the  fundamental lemma relates orbital integrals on a reductive group over a local field to stable orbital integrals on its endoscopic groups. It was conjectured by Robert Langlands (1983) in the course of developing the Langlands program.  The fundamental lemma was proved by Gérard Laumon and Ngô Bảo Châu in the case of unitary groups and then by Ngô (2010) for general reductive groups, building on a series of important reductions made by Jean-Loup Waldspurger to the case of Lie algebras. Time magazine placed Ngô's proof on the list of the \"Top 10 scientific discoveries of 2009\".[1] In 2010, Ngô was awarded the Fields Medal for this proof.","image":"f591de2c303a0bd46ac2990d2dc00c00cea6fb19.svg","url":"Fundamental_lemma_(Langlands_program)"}
