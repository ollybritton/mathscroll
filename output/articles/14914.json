{"title":"Stahl's theorem","summary":"In matrix analysis Stahl's theorem is a theorem proved in 2011 by Herbert Stahl concerning Laplace transforms for special matrix functions.[1] It originated in 1975 as the Bessis-Moussa-Villani (BMV) conjecture by Daniel Bessis, Pierre Moussa, and Marcel Villani.[2] In 2004 Elliott H. Lieb and Robert Seiringer gave two important reformulations of the BMV conjecture.[3] In 2015 Alexandre Eremenko gave a simplified proof of Stahl's theorem.[4]","image":"7e779faa4557258ea25e8101f307317fc771a1ef.svg","url":"Stahl's_theorem"}
