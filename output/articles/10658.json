{"title":"Monoidal functor","summary":"In category theory, monoidal functors are functors between monoidal categories which preserve the monoidal structure. More specifically, a monoidal functor between two monoidal categories consists of a functor between the categories, along with two coherence mapsâ€”a natural transformation and a morphism that preserve monoidal multiplication and unit, respectively.  Mathematicians require these coherence maps to satisfy additional properties depending on how strictly they want to preserve the monoidal structure; each of these properties gives rise to a slightly different definition of monoidal functors","image":"26b8350b37775196f81e5c80dd1dac8943dd6783.svg","url":"Monoidal_functor"}
