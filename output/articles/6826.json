{"title":"Hall–Littlewood polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the Hall–Littlewood polynomials are symmetric functions depending on a parameter t and a partition λ.  They are Schur functions when t is 0 and monomial symmetric functions when t is 1 and are special cases of Macdonald polynomials. They were first defined indirectly by  Philip Hall using the Hall algebra, and later defined directly by Dudley E. Littlewood (1961).","image":"7af45e3e9c8849883a5e7bbe7039b00b783a20a7.svg","url":"Hall–Littlewood_polynomials"}
