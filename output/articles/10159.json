{"title":"Matrix representation of conic sections","summary":"In mathematics, the matrix representation of conic sections permits the tools of linear algebra to be used in the study of conic sections. It provides easy ways to calculate a conic section's axis, vertices, tangents and the pole and polar relationship between points and lines of the plane determined by the conic. The technique does not require putting the equation of a conic section into a standard form, thus making it easier to investigate those conic sections whose axes are not parallel to the coordinate system.","image":"e8fe675550a9ec39d1ea7817d95abbc64b6bd216.svg","url":"Matrix_representation_of_conic_sections"}
