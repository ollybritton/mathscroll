{"title":"Mittag-Leffler's theorem","summary":"In complex analysis, Mittag-Leffler's theorem concerns the existence of meromorphic functions with prescribed poles. Conversely, it can be used to express any meromorphic function as a sum of partial fractions. It is sister to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, which asserts existence of holomorphic functions with prescribed zeros.","image":"458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025.svg","url":"Mittag-Leffler's_theorem"}
