{"title":"Field line","summary":"A field line is a graphical visual aid for visualizing vector fields. It consists of an imaginary integral curve which is tangent to the field vector at each point along its length.[1][2]   A diagram showing a representative set of neighboring field lines is a common way of depicting a vector field in scientific and mathematical literature; this is called a field line diagram.  They are used to show electric fields, magnetic fields, and gravitational fields among many other types.  In fluid mechanics field lines showing the velocity field of a fluid flow are called streamlines.","image":"Electric_Field_Lines.svg.png.webp","url":"Field_line"}
