{"title":"Truncated pentahexagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the truncated tetrahexagonal tiling is a semiregular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. There are one square, one decagon, and one dodecagon on each vertex. It has Schl√§fli symbol of t0,1,2{6,5}. Its name is somewhat misleading: literal geometric truncation of pentahexagonal tiling produces rectangles instead of squares.","image":"H2_tiling_256-7.png.webp","url":"Truncated_pentahexagonal_tiling"}
