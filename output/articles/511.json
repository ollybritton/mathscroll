{"title":"Alekseev–Gröbner formula","summary":"The Alekseev–Gröbner formula, or nonlinear variation-of-constants formula, is a generalization of the linear variation of constants formula which was proven independently by Wolfgang Gröbner in 1960[1] and Vladimir Mikhailovich Alekseev in 1961.[2] It expresses the global error of a perturbation in terms of the local error and has many applications for studying perturbations of ordinary differential equations.[3]","image":"6a86f7fcd041c0196f44e7c04f4b3eac94e5a757.svg","url":"Alekseev–Gröbner_formula"}
