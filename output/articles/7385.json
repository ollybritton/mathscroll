{"title":"Homotopy excision theorem","summary":"In algebraic topology, the homotopy excision theorem offers a substitute for the absence of excision in homotopy theory. More precisely, let ( X ; A , B ) {\\displaystyle (X;A,B)} be an excisive triad with C = A ∩ B {\\displaystyle C=A\\cap B} nonempty, and suppose the pair ( A , C ) {\\displaystyle (A,C)} is ( m − 1 {\\displaystyle m-1} )-connected, m ≥ 2 {\\displaystyle m\\geq 2} , and the pair ( B , C ) {\\displaystyle (B,C)} is ( n − 1 {\\displaystyle n-1} )-connected, n ≥ 1 {\\displaystyle n\\geq 1} . Then the map induced by the inclusion i : ( A , C ) → ( X , B ) {\\displaystyle i\\colon (A,C)\\to (X,B)} ,","image":"2c24603a7122b19df45d210610ff7932d361537d.svg","url":"Homotopy_excision_theorem"}
