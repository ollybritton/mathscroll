{"title":"Recursively enumerable language","summary":"In mathematics, logic and computer science, a formal language is called recursively enumerable (also recognizable, partially decidable, semidecidable, Turing-acceptable or Turing-recognizable) if it is a recursively enumerable subset in the set of all possible words over the alphabet of the language, i.e., if there exists a Turing machine which will enumerate all valid strings of the language.","image":"d9a3547ba2f3cc5cb4463473815f227092b4766a.svg","url":"Recursively_enumerable_language"}
