{"title":"Discrete phase-type distribution","summary":"The discrete phase-type distribution is a probability distribution that results from a system of one or more inter-related geometric distributions occurring in sequence, or phases. The sequence in which each of the phases occur may itself be a stochastic process. The distribution can be represented by a random variable describing the time until absorption of an absorbing Markov chain with one absorbing state. Each of the states of the Markov chain represents one of the phases.","image":"0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc.svg","url":"Discrete_phase-type_distribution"}
