{"title":"Pathological (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, when a mathematical phenomenon runs counter to some intuition, then the phenomenon is sometimes called pathological. On the other hand, if a phenomenon does not run counter to intuition, it is sometimes called well-behaved. These terms are sometimes useful in mathematical research and teaching, but there is no strict mathematical definition of pathological or well-behaved.[1]","image":"WeierstrassFunction.svg.png.webp","url":"Pathological_(mathematics)"}
