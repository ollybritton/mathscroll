{"title":"Bianchi classification","summary":"In mathematics, the Bianchi classification provides a list of all real 3-dimensional Lie algebras (up to isomorphism).  The classification contains 11 classes, 9 of which contain a single Lie algebra and two of which contain a continuum-sized family of Lie algebras. (Sometimes two of the groups are included in the infinite families, giving 9 instead of 11 classes.)  The classification is important in geometry and physics, because the associated Lie groups serve as symmetry groups of 3-dimensional Riemannian manifolds.  It is named for Luigi Bianchi, who worked it out in 1898.","image":"33ed9322e8f9616764e6630498e55386893cae2a.svg","url":"Bianchi_classification"}
