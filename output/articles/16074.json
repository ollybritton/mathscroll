{"title":"Trigonometric substitution","summary":"In mathematics, trigonometric substitution is the replacement of trigonometric functions for other expressions. In calculus, trigonometric substitution is a technique for evaluating integrals. Moreover, one may use the trigonometric identities to simplify certain integrals containing radical expressions.[1][2] Like other methods of integration by substitution, when evaluating a definite integral, it may be simpler to completely deduce the antiderivative before applying the boundaries of integration.","image":"Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_1.svg.png.webp","url":"Trigonometric_substitution"}
