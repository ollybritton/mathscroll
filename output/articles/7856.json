{"title":"Integer factorization","summary":"In number theory, integer factorization is the decomposition, when possible, of a positive integer into a product of smaller integers. If the factors are further restricted to be prime numbers, the process is called prime factorization, and includes the test whether the given integer is prime (in this case, one has a \"product\" of a single factor).","image":"PrimeDecompositionExample.svg.png.webp","url":"Integer_factorization"}
