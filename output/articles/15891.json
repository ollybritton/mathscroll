{"title":"Torsion-free module","summary":"In algebra, a torsion-free module is a module over a ring such that zero is the only element annihilated by a regular element (non zero-divisor) of the ring. In other words, a module is torsion free if its torsion submodule is reduced to its zero element.","image":"9fed6a46b79218af44f23e5d6f487fb7e0d6cd01.svg","url":"Torsion-free_module"}
