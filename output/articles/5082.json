{"title":"Euler sequence","summary":"In mathematics, the Euler sequence is a particular exact sequence of sheaves on n-dimensional projective space over a ring. It shows that the sheaf of relative differentials is stably isomorphic to an ( n + 1 ) {\\displaystyle (n+1)} -fold sum of the dual of the Serre twisting sheaf.","image":"b30a29cfd35628469f9dbffea4804f5b422f3037.svg","url":"Euler_sequence"}
