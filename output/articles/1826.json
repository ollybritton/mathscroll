{"title":"Boole's expansion theorem","summary":"Boole's expansion theorem, often referred to as the Shannon expansion or decomposition, is the identity: F = x ⋅ F x + x ′ ⋅ F x ′ {\\displaystyle F=x\\cdot F_{x}+x'\\cdot F_{x'}} , where F {\\displaystyle F} is any Boolean function, x {\\displaystyle x} is a variable, x ′ {\\displaystyle x'} is the complement of x {\\displaystyle x} , and F x {\\displaystyle F_{x}} and F x ′ {\\displaystyle F_{x'}} are F {\\displaystyle F} with the argument x {\\displaystyle x} set equal to 1 {\\displaystyle 1} and to 0 {\\displaystyle 0} respectively.","image":"14687cef86832151d873d70a04d05bc687c3edd3.svg","url":"Boole's_expansion_theorem"}
