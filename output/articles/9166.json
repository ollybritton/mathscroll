{"title":"Lehmer's GCD algorithm","summary":"Lehmer's GCD algorithm, named after Derrick Henry Lehmer, is a fast GCD algorithm, an improvement on the simpler but slower Euclidean algorithm. It is mainly used for big integers that have a representation as a string of digits relative to some chosen numeral system base, say β = 1000 or β = 232.","image":"698f03ecce1902205a89088926ae4d76a6be564f.svg","url":"Lehmer's_GCD_algorithm"}
