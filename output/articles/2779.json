{"title":"Closed graph theorem (functional analysis)","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in functional analysis and topology, the closed graph theorem is a result connecting the continuity of certain kinds of functions to a topological property of their graph.  In its most elementary form, the closed graph theorem states that a linear function between two Banach spaces is continuous if and only if the graph of that function is closed.","image":"abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c.svg","url":"Closed_graph_theorem_(functional_analysis)"}
