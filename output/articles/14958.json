{"title":"Stationary set","summary":"In mathematics, specifically set theory and model theory, a stationary set is a set that is not too small in the sense that it intersects all club sets, and is analogous to a set of non-zero measure in measure theory. There are at least three closely related notions of stationary set, depending on whether one is looking at subsets of an ordinal, or subsets of something of given cardinality, or a powerset.","image":"54ddec2e922c5caea4e47d04feef86e782dc8e6d.svg","url":"Stationary_set"}
