{"title":"Nonlinear expectation","summary":"In probability theory, a nonlinear expectation is a nonlinear generalization of the expectation. Nonlinear expectations are useful in utility theory as they more closely match human behavior than traditional expectations.[1] The common use of nonlinear expectations is in assessing risks under uncertainty. Generally, nonlinear expectations are categorized into sub-linear and super-linear expectations dependent on the additive properties of the given sets. Much of the study of nonlinear expectation is attributed to work of mathematicians within the past two decades.","image":"ad05c7409041159d0a1b759be24af4ede0fddca5.svg","url":"Nonlinear_expectation"}
