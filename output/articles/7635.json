{"title":"Identity theorem","summary":"In real analysis and complex analysis, branches of mathematics, the identity theorem for analytic functions states: given functions f and g analytic on a domain D (open and connected subset of R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } or C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } ), if f = g on some S âŠ† D {\\displaystyle S\\subseteq D} , where S {\\displaystyle S} has an accumulation point, then f = g on D.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Identity_theorem"}
