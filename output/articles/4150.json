{"title":"Dini test","summary":"In mathematics, the Dini and Diniâ€“Lipschitz tests are highly precise tests that can be used to prove that the Fourier series of a function converges at a given point. These tests are named after Ulisse Dini and Rudolf Lipschitz.[1]","image":"8d09113fff32ad8f23c0ead8e826626e2bf1cb38.svg","url":"Dini_test"}
