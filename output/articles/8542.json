{"title":"K-tree","summary":"In graph theory, a k-tree is an undirected graph formed by starting with a (k + 1)-vertex complete graph and then repeatedly adding vertices in such a way that each added vertex v has exactly k neighbors U such that, together, the k + 1 vertices formed by v and U form a clique.[1][2]","image":"Goldner-Harary_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"K-tree"}
