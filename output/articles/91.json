{"title":"5-cubic honeycomb","summary":"In geometry, the 5-cubic honeycomb or penteractic honeycomb is the only regular space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 5-space. Four 5-cubes meet at each cubic cell, and it is more explicitly called an order-4 penteractic honeycomb.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"5-cubic_honeycomb"}
