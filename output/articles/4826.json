{"title":"End (topology)","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, the ends of a topological space are, roughly speaking, the connected components of the \"ideal boundary\" of the space.  That is, each end represents a topologically distinct way to move to infinity within the space.  Adding a point at each end yields a compactification of the original space, known as the end compactification.","image":"c8cf2fd503db351401056653e6535f2e1b8bce29.svg","url":"End_(topology)"}
