{"title":"Second derivative","summary":"In calculus, the second derivative, or the second-order derivative, of a function f is the derivative of the derivative of f.  Roughly speaking, the second derivative measures how the rate of change of a quantity is itself changing; for example, the second derivative of the position of an object with respect to time is the instantaneous acceleration of the object, or the rate at which the velocity of the object is changing with respect to time.
