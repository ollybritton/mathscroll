{"title":"Internal and external angles","summary":"In geometry, an angle of a polygon is formed by two sides of the polygon that share an endpoint.  For a simple (non-self-intersecting) polygon, regardless of whether it is convex or non-convex, this angle is called an interior angle (or .mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#b1d2ff}internal angle) if a point within the angle is in the interior of the polygon. A polygon has exactly one internal angle per vertex.","image":"ExternalAngles.svg.png.webp","url":"Internal_and_external_angles"}
