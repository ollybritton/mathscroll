{"title":"Mostow rigidity theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Mostow's rigidity theorem, or  strong rigidity theorem, or Mostow–Prasad rigidity theorem, essentially states that the geometry of a complete, finite-volume hyperbolic manifold of dimension greater than two is determined by the fundamental group and hence unique. The theorem was proven for closed manifolds by Mostow (1968) and extended to  finite volume manifolds by Marden (1974) in 3 dimensions, and by Prasad (1973) in all dimensions at least 3.  Gromov (1981) gave an alternate proof using the Gromov norm. Besson, Courtois & Gallot (1996) gave the simplest available proof.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Mostow_rigidity_theorem"}
