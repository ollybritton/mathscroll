{"title":"Trace field of a representation","summary":"In mathematics, the trace field of a linear group is the field generated by the traces of its elements. It is mostly studied for Kleinian and Fuchsian groups, though related objects are used in the theory of lattices in Lie groups, often under the name field of definition.","image":"9a572bcac5b6129069cfbf1bb8b6a82da43387c6.svg","url":"Trace_field_of_a_representation"}
