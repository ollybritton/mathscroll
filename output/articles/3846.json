{"title":"Decagonal bipyramid","summary":"In geometry, a decagonal bipyramid is one of the infinite set of bipyramids, dual to the infinite prisms. If a decagonal bipyramid is to be face-transitive, all faces must be isosceles triangles. It is an icosahedron, but not the regular one.","image":"Decagonal_bipyramid.png.webp","url":"Decagonal_bipyramid"}
