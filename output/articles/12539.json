{"title":"Pro-p group","summary":"In mathematics, a pro-p group (for some prime number p) is a profinite group G {\\displaystyle G} such that for any open normal subgroup N â—ƒ G {\\displaystyle N\\triangleleft G} the quotient group G / N {\\displaystyle G/N} is a p-group. Note that, as profinite groups are compact, the open subgroups are exactly the closed subgroups of finite index, so that the discrete quotient group is always finite.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Pro-p_group"}
