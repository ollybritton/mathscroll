{"title":"Frequency domain decomposition","summary":"The frequency domain decomposition (FDD) is an output-only system identification technique popular in civil engineering, in particular in structural health monitoring.  As an output-only algorithm, it is useful when the input data is unknown.  FDD is a modal analysis technique which generates a system realization using the frequency response given (multi-)output data.[1][2]","image":"56113614e2692f8be6d6a684069fa61fee2544f4.svg","url":"Frequency_domain_decomposition"}
