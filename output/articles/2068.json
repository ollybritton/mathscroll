{"title":"Burr–Erdős conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the Burr–Erdős conjecture was a problem concerning the Ramsey number of sparse graphs. The conjecture is named after Stefan Burr and Paul Erdős, and is one of many conjectures named after Erdős; it states that the Ramsey number of graphs in any sparse family of graphs should grow linearly in the number of vertices of the graph.","image":"2090fa063ac3b8f29cebaa05ca68dee761904b98.svg","url":"Burr–Erdős_conjecture"}
