{"title":"Informal logic","summary":"Informal logic encompasses the principles of logic and logical thought outside of a formal setting (characterized by the usage of particular statements). However, the precise definition of \"informal logic\" is a matter of some dispute.[1] Ralph H. Johnson and J. Anthony Blair define informal logic as \"a branch of logic whose task is to develop non-formal standards, criteria, procedures for the analysis, interpretation, evaluation, criticism and construction of argumentation.\"[2] This definition reflects what had been implicit in their practice and what others were doing in their informal logic texts.","image":"Argument_terminology_used_in_logic_(en).svg.png.webp","url":"Informal_logic"}
