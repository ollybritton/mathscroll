{"title":"Split-complex number","summary":"In algebra, a split complex number (or hyperbolic number, also perplex number, double number) is based on a hyperbolic unit j satisfying j 2 = 1. {\\displaystyle j^{2}=1.} A split-complex number has two real number components x and y, and is written z = x + y j . {\\displaystyle z=x+yj.} The conjugate of z is z ∗ = x − y j . {\\displaystyle z^{*}=x-yj.} Since j 2 = 1 , {\\displaystyle j^{2}=1,} the product of a number z with its conjugate is N ( z ) := z z ∗ = x 2 − y 2 , {\\displaystyle N(z):=zz^{*}=x^{2}-y^{2},} an isotropic quadratic form.","image":"21a47a5a4713f53fc7891bd178b8310f04024ba7.svg","url":"Split-complex_number"}
