{"title":"Simons' formula","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, the Simons formula (also known as the Simons identity, and in some variants as the Simons inequality) is a fundamental equation in the study of minimal submanifolds. It was discovered by James Simons in 1968.[1] It can be viewed as a formula for the Laplacian of the second fundamental form of a Riemannian submanifold. It is often quoted and used in the less precise form of a formula or inequality for the Laplacian of the length of the second fundamental form.","image":"b59bc473b5d9345947cb8be6330a53ae52da8c6b.svg","url":"Simons'_formula"}
