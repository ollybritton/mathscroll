{"title":"Legendre wavelet","summary":"In functional analysis, compactly supported wavelets derived from Legendre polynomials are termed Legendre wavelets or spherical harmonic wavelets.[1] Legendre functions have widespread applications in which spherical coordinate system is appropriate.[2][3][4] As with many wavelets there is no nice analytical formula for describing these harmonic spherical wavelets. The low-pass filter associated to Legendre multiresolution analysis is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter.","image":"8bf7412371edf4987653da2ae8388906ee1a0d4d.svg","url":"Legendre_wavelet"}
