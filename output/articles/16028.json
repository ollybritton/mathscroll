{"title":"Triangle inequality","summary":"In mathematics, the triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side.[1][2] This statement permits the inclusion of degenerate triangles, but some authors, especially those writing about elementary geometry, will exclude this possibility, thus leaving out the possibility of equality.[3] If x, y, and z are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, with no side being greater than z, then the triangle inequality states that","image":"b3eca611f465cd00b8c23bda5465bf66d3f169fb.svg","url":"Triangle_inequality"}
