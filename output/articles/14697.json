{"title":"Space group","summary":"In mathematics, physics and chemistry, a space group is the symmetry group of an object in space, usually in three dimensions.[1] The elements of a space group (its symmetry operations) are the rigid transformations of an object that leave it unchanged. In three dimensions, space groups are classified into 219 distinct types, or 230 types if chiral copies are considered distinct. Space groups are discrete cocompact groups of isometries of an oriented Euclidean space in any number of dimensions. In dimensions other than 3, they are sometimes called Bieberbach groups.","image":"Ice_Ih_Space_Group.jpg.webp","url":"Space_group"}
