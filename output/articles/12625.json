{"title":"Projective tensor product","summary":"The strongest locally convex topological vector space (TVS) topology on X ⊗ Y , {\\displaystyle X\\otimes Y,} the tensor product of two locally convex TVSs, making the canonical map ⋅ ⊗ ⋅ : X × Y → X ⊗ Y {\\displaystyle \\cdot \\otimes \\cdot :X\\times Y\\to X\\otimes Y} (defined by sending ( x , y ) ∈ X × Y {\\displaystyle (x,y)\\in X\\times Y} to x ⊗ y {\\displaystyle x\\otimes y} ) continuous is called the projective topology or the π-topology. When X ⊗ Y {\\displaystyle X\\otimes Y} is endowed with this topology then it is denoted by X ⊗ π Y {\\displaystyle X\\otimes _{\\pi }Y} and called the projective tensor product of X {\\displaystyle X} and Y . {\\displaystyle Y.}","image":"0725a9acd1b89f205f40114ced6fe8aa0232000b.svg","url":"Projective_tensor_product"}
