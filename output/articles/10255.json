{"title":"Mean curvature flow","summary":"In the field of differential geometry in mathematics, mean curvature flow is an example of a geometric flow of hypersurfaces in a Riemannian manifold (for example, smooth surfaces in 3-dimensional Euclidean space). Intuitively, a family of surfaces evolves under mean curvature flow if the normal component of the velocity of which a point on the surface moves is given by the mean curvature of the surface.  For example, a round sphere evolves under mean curvature flow by shrinking inward uniformly (since the mean curvature vector of a sphere points inward).  Except in special cases, the mean curvature flow develops singularities.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Mean_curvature_flow"}
