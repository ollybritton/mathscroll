{"title":"GJMS operator","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, the GJMS operators are a family of differential operators, that are defined on a Riemannian manifold.  In an appropriate sense, they depend only on the conformal structure of the manifold.  The GJMS operators generalize the Paneitz operator and the conformal Laplacian.  The initials GJMS are for its discoverers Graham, Jenne, Mason & Sparling (1992).","image":"9c7ecc5a46976499914e67d3067889475e82539c.svg","url":"GJMS_operator"}
