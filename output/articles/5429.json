{"title":"Finding Ellipses","summary":"Finding Ellipses: What Blaschke Products, Ponceletâ€™s Theorem, and the Numerical Range Know about Each Other is a mathematics book on \"some surprising connections among complex analysis, geometry, and linear algebra\",[1] and on the connected ways that ellipses can arise from other subjects of study in all three of these fields.[2] It was written by Ulrich Daepp, Pamela Gorkin, Andrew Shaffer, and Karl Voss, and published in 2019 by the American Mathematical Society and Mathematical Association of America as volume 34 of the Carus Mathematical Monographs, a series of books aimed at presenting technical topics in mathematics to a wide audience.[3]","image":"2aae8864a3c1fec9585261791a809ddec1489950.svg","url":"Finding_Ellipses"}
