{"title":"Whitening transformation","summary":"A whitening transformation or sphering transformation is a linear transformation that transforms a vector of random variables with a known covariance matrix into a set of new variables whose covariance is the identity matrix, meaning that they are uncorrelated and each have variance 1.[1] The transformation is called \"whitening\" because it changes the input vector into a white noise vector.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Whitening_transformation"}
