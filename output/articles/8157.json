{"title":"Jacobi identity","summary":"In mathematics, the Jacobi identity is a property of a binary operation that describes how the order of evaluation, the placement of parentheses in a multiple product, affects the result of the operation. By contrast, for operations with the associative property, any order of evaluation gives the same result (parentheses in a multiple product are not needed). The identity is named after the German mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.","image":"65b420244850c1a22be4c326f91e146db8b037f0.svg","url":"Jacobi_identity"}
