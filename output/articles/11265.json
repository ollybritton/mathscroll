{"title":"Nuclear space","summary":"In mathematics, nuclear spaces are topological vector spaces that can be viewed as a generalization of finite dimensional Euclidean spaces and share many of their desirable properties. Nuclear spaces are however quite different from Hilbert spaces, another generalization of finite dimensional Euclidean spaces. They were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck.","image":"ba863cae04c766a9c67fb249dd2b41117e218aa5.svg","url":"Nuclear_space"}
