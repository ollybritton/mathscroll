{"title":"MM algorithm","summary":"The MM algorithm is an iterative optimization method which exploits the convexity of a function in order to find its maxima or minima. The MM stands for “Majorize-Minimization” or “Minorize-Maximization”, depending on whether the desired optimization is a minimization or a maximization. Despite the name, MM itself is not an algorithm, but a description of how to construct an optimization algorithm.","image":"Mmalgorithm.jpg.webp","url":"MM_algorithm"}
