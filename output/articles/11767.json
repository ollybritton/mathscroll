{"title":"Parabolic cylindrical coordinates","summary":"In mathematics, parabolic cylindrical coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from projecting the two-dimensional parabolic coordinate system in the perpendicular z {\\displaystyle z} -direction.  Hence, the coordinate surfaces are confocal parabolic cylinders. Parabolic cylindrical coordinates have found many applications, e.g., the potential theory of edges.","image":"bf368e72c009decd9b6686ee84a375632e11de98.svg","url":"Parabolic_cylindrical_coordinates"}
