{"title":"De Boor's algorithm","summary":"In the mathematical subfield of numerical analysis de Boor's algorithm[1] is a polynomial-time and numerically stable algorithm for evaluating spline curves in B-spline form. It is a generalization of de Casteljau's algorithm for BÃ©zier curves. The algorithm was devised by Carl R. de Boor.  Simplified, potentially faster variants of the de Boor algorithm have been created but they suffer from comparatively lower stability.[2][3]","image":"8c3b9c4de5b833fbb7f44c912c3f0cc395a71120.svg","url":"De_Boor's_algorithm"}
