{"title":"Jet group","summary":"In mathematics, a jet group is a generalization of the general linear group which applies to Taylor polynomials instead of vectors at a point.  A jet group is a group of jets that describes how a Taylor polynomial transforms under changes of coordinate systems (or, equivalently, diffeomorphisms).","image":"e8b84dd5be8c1362714907f5315107139442fa2e.svg","url":"Jet_group"}
