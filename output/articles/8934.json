{"title":"LF-space","summary":"In mathematics, an LF-space, also written (LF)-space, is a topological vector space (TVS) X that is a locally convex inductive limit of a countable inductive system ( X n , i n m ) {\\displaystyle (X_{n},i_{nm})} of Fréchet spaces.[1] This means that X is a direct limit of a direct system ( X n , i n m ) {\\displaystyle (X_{n},i_{nm})} in the category of locally convex topological vector spaces and each X n {\\displaystyle X_{n}} is a Fréchet space. The name LF stands for Limit of Fréchet spaces.","image":"1f92cc1c0949576a7b4e0fadf4b650a543fab0c7.svg","url":"LF-space"}
