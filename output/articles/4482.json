{"title":"Dual basis","summary":"In linear algebra, given a vector space V {\\displaystyle V} with a basis B {\\displaystyle B} of vectors indexed by an index set I {\\displaystyle I} (the cardinality of I {\\displaystyle I} is the dimension of V {\\displaystyle V} ), the dual set of B {\\displaystyle B} is a set B ∗ {\\displaystyle B^{*}} of vectors in the dual space V ∗ {\\displaystyle V^{*}} with the same index set I such that B {\\displaystyle B} and B ∗ {\\displaystyle B^{*}} form a biorthogonal system. The dual set is always linearly independent but does not necessarily span V ∗ {\\displaystyle V^{*}} . If it does span V ∗ {\\displaystyle V^{*}} , then B ∗ {\\displaystyle B^{*}} is called the dual basis or reciprocal basis for the basis B {\\displaystyle B} .","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Dual_basis"}
