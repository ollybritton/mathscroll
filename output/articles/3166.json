{"title":"Conductor (ring theory)","summary":"In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, the conductor is a measurement of how far apart a commutative ring and an extension ring are.  Most often, the larger ring is a domain integrally closed in its field of fractions, and then the conductor measures the failure of the smaller ring to be integrally closed.","image":"b5e246973ea1fa6078e62cd81ee39f1d711ab1f0.svg","url":"Conductor_(ring_theory)"}
