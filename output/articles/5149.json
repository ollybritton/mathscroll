{"title":"Exotic sphere","summary":"In an area of mathematics called differential topology, an exotic sphere is a differentiable manifold M that is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the standard Euclidean n-sphere. That is, M is a sphere from the point of view of all its topological properties, but carrying a smooth structure that is not the familiar one (hence the name \"exotic\").","image":"a264db40fcdf1645e6dabe1885e21595de502623.svg","url":"Exotic_sphere"}
