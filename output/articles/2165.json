{"title":"Canonical correlation","summary":"In statistics, canonical-correlation analysis (CCA), also called canonical variates analysis, is a way of inferring information from cross-covariance matrices. If we have two vectors X = (X1, ..., Xn) and Y = (Y1, ..., Ym)  of random variables, and there are correlations among the variables, then canonical-correlation analysis will find linear combinations of X and Y which have maximum correlation with each other.[1] T. R. Knapp notes that \"virtually all of the commonly encountered parametric tests of significance can be treated as special cases of canonical-correlation analysis, which is the general procedure for investigating the relationships between two sets of variables.\"[2] The method was first introduced by Harold Hotelling in 1936,[3] although in the context of angles between flats the mathematical concept was published by Jordan in 1875.[4]","image":"Kernel_Machine.svg.png.webp","url":"Canonical_correlation"}
