{"title":"Nahm equations","summary":"In differential geometry and gauge theory, the Nahm equations are a system of ordinary differential equations introduced by Werner Nahm in the context of the Nahm transform â€“ an alternative to Ward's twistor construction of monopoles. The Nahm equations are formally analogous to the algebraic equations in the ADHM construction of instantons, where finite order matrices are replaced by differential operators.","image":"7a142862c33556faa168eab4940846fdcf3f916b.svg","url":"Nahm_equations"}
