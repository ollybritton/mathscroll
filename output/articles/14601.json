{"title":"Snub disphenoid","summary":"In geometry, the snub disphenoid, Siamese dodecahedron, triangular dodecahedron, trigonal dodecahedron, or dodecadeltahedron is a convex polyhedron with twelve equilateral triangles as its faces. It is not a regular polyhedron because some vertices have four faces and others have five. It is a dodecahedron, one of the eight deltahedra (convex polyhedra with equilateral triangle faces), and is the 84th Johnson solid (non-uniform convex polyhedra with regular faces). It can be thought of as a square antiprism where both squares are replaced with two equilateral triangles.","image":"Snub_disphenoid.png.webp","url":"Snub_disphenoid"}
