{"title":"Differential equations of addition","summary":"In cryptography, differential equations of addition (DEA) are one of the most basic equations related to differential cryptanalysis that mix additions over two different groups (e.g. addition modulo 232 and addition over GF(2)) and  where input and output differences are expressed as XORs.","image":"c1307330f7dcb88b70b24efb46217ef66271fb11.svg","url":"Differential_equations_of_addition"}
