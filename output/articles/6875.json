{"title":"Happy number","summary":"In number theory, a happy number is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit. For instance, 13 is a happy number because 1 2 + 3 2 = 10 {\\displaystyle 1^{2}+3^{2}=10} , and 1 2 + 0 2 = 1 {\\displaystyle 1^{2}+0^{2}=1} . On the other hand, 4 is not a happy number because the sequence starting with 4 2 = 16 {\\displaystyle 4^{2}=16} and 1 2 + 6 2 = 37 {\\displaystyle 1^{2}+6^{2}=37} eventually reaches 2 2 + 0 2 = 4 {\\displaystyle 2^{2}+0^{2}=4} , the number that started the sequence, and so the process continues in an infinite cycle without ever reaching 1. A number which is not happy is called sad or unhappy.","image":"3ca013c764f3885effc09f853b6d4c170782829e.svg","url":"Happy_number"}
