{"title":"Spiral similarity","summary":"Spiral similarity is a plane transformation in mathematics composed of a rotation and a dilation.[1] It is used widely in Euclidean geometry to facilitate the proofs of many theorems and other results in geometry, especially in mathematical competitions and Olympiads. Though the origin of this idea is not known, it was documented in 1967 by Coxeter in his book Geometry Revisited.[2]","image":"Spiral_similarity_example.png.webp","url":"Spiral_similarity"}
