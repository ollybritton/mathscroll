{"title":"Biconnected graph","summary":"In graph theory, a biconnected graph is a connected and \"nonseparable\" graph, meaning that if any one vertex were to be removed, the graph will remain connected. Therefore a biconnected graph has no articulation vertices.","image":"4_Node_Biconnected.svg.png.webp","url":"Biconnected_graph"}
