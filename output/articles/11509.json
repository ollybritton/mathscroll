{"title":"Order-7 heptagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the order-7 heptagonal tiling is a regular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It has Schl√§fli symbol of {7,7}, constructed from seven heptagons around every vertex. As such, it is self-dual.","image":"H2_tiling_277-1.png.webp","url":"Order-7_heptagonal_tiling"}
