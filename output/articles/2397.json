{"title":"Cayley–Dickson construction","summary":"In mathematics, the Cayley–Dickson construction, named after Arthur Cayley and Leonard Eugene Dickson, produces a sequence of algebras over the field of real numbers, each with twice the dimension of the previous one. The algebras produced by this process are known as Cayley–Dickson algebras, for example complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions. These examples are useful composition algebras frequently applied in mathematical physics.","image":"7d830752ba5512b4e89a466665dd460705ec4d7d.svg","url":"Cayley–Dickson_construction"}
