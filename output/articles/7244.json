{"title":"Hilbert cube","summary":"In mathematics, the Hilbert cube, named after David Hilbert, is a topological space that provides an instructive example of some ideas in topology. Furthermore, many interesting topological spaces can be embedded in the Hilbert cube; that is, can be viewed as subspaces of the Hilbert cube (see below).","image":"Hilbert_cube.svg.png.webp","url":"Hilbert_cube"}
