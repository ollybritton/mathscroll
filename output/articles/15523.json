{"title":"Tate conjecture","summary":"In number theory and algebraic geometry, the Tate conjecture is a 1963 conjecture of John Tate that would describe the algebraic cycles on a variety in terms of a more computable invariant, the Galois representation on Ã©tale cohomology. The conjecture is a central problem in the theory of algebraic cycles. It can be considered an arithmetic analog of the Hodge conjecture.","image":"John_Tate.jpg.webp","url":"Tate_conjecture"}
