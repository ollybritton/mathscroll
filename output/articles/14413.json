{"title":"Simplicial group","summary":"In mathematics, more precisely, in the theory of simplicial sets, a simplicial group is a simplicial object in the category of groups. Similarly, a simplicial abelian group is a simplicial object in the category of abelian groups. A simplicial group is a Kan complex (in particular, its homotopy groups make sense). The Dold–Kan correspondence says that a simplicial abelian group may be identified with a chain complex. In fact it can be shown that any simplicial abelian group A {\\displaystyle A} is non-canonically homotopy equivalent to a product of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces, ∏ i ≥ 0 K ( π i A , i ) . {\\displaystyle \\prod _{i\\geq 0}K(\\pi _{i}A,i).} [1]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Simplicial_group"}
