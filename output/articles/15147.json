{"title":"Strong operator topology","summary":"In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the strong operator topology, often abbreviated SOT, is the locally convex topology on the set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space H induced by the seminorms of the form T ↦ ‖ T x ‖ {\\displaystyle T\\mapsto \\|Tx\\|} , as x varies in H.","image":"5ade640c515c2e726c8207c5b4dedd2007302403.svg","url":"Strong_operator_topology"}
