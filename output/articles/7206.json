{"title":"Highly structured ring spectrum","summary":"In mathematics, a highly structured ring spectrum or A ∞ {\\displaystyle A_{\\infty }} -ring is an object in homotopy theory encoding a refinement of a multiplicative structure on a cohomology theory. A commutative version of an A ∞ {\\displaystyle A_{\\infty }} -ring is called an E ∞ {\\displaystyle E_{\\infty }} -ring. While originally motivated by questions of geometric topology and bundle theory, they are today most often used in stable homotopy theory.","image":"15b6dfe5968776343496f22a0a90c8406065def1.svg","url":"Highly_structured_ring_spectrum"}
