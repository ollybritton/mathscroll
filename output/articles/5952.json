{"title":"Gamma process","summary":"Also known as the (Moran-)Gamma Process,[1] the gamma process is a random process studied in mathematics, statistics, probability theory, and stochastics. The gamma process is a stochastic or random process consisting of independently distributed gamma distributions where N ( t ) {\\displaystyle N(t)} represents the number of event occurrences from time 0 to time t {\\displaystyle t} . The gamma distribution has scale parameter γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } and shape parameter λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } , often written as Γ ( γ , λ ) {\\displaystyle \\Gamma (\\gamma ,\\lambda )} .[2] Both γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } and λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } must be greater than 0. The gamma process is often written as Γ ( t , γ , λ ) {\\displaystyle \\Gamma (t,\\gamma ,\\lambda )} where t {\\displaystyle t} represents the time from 0. The process is a pure-jump increasing Lévy process with intensity measure ν ( x ) = γ x − 1 exp ⁡ ( − λ x ) , {\\displaystyle \\nu (x)=\\gamma x^{-1}\\exp(-\\lambda x),} for all positive x {\\displaystyle x} . Thus jumps whose size lies in the interval [ x , x + d x ) {\\displaystyle [x,x+dx)} occur as a Poisson process with intensity ν ( x ) d x . {\\displaystyle \\nu (x)\\,dx.} The parameter γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } controls the rate of jump arrivals and the scaling parameter λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } inversely controls the jump size. It is assumed that the process starts from a value 0 at t = 0 meaning N ( 0 ) = 0 {\\displaystyle N(0)=0} .","image":"4a8aa64e349180ee714adfb6620d3bb4610d97d0.svg","url":"Gamma_process"}
