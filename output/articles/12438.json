{"title":"Power series solution of differential equations","summary":"In mathematics, the power series method is used to seek a power series solution to certain differential equations. In general, such a solution assumes a power series with unknown coefficients, then substitutes that solution into the differential equation to find a recurrence relation for the coefficients.","image":"086761ecc5ab4243829c761a110583ac09fbf88f.svg","url":"Power_series_solution_of_differential_equations"}
