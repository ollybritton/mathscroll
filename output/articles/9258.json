{"title":"Lie's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, specifically the theory of Lie algebras, Lie's theorem states that,[1] over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, if π : g → g l ( V ) {\\displaystyle \\pi :{\\mathfrak {g}}\\to {\\mathfrak {gl}}(V)} is a finite-dimensional representation of a solvable Lie algebra, then there's a flag V = V 0 ⊃ V 1 ⊃ ⋯ ⊃ V n = 0 {\\displaystyle V=V_{0}\\supset V_{1}\\supset \\cdots \\supset V_{n}=0} of invariant subspaces of π ( g ) {\\displaystyle \\pi ({\\mathfrak {g}})} with codim ⁡ V i = i {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {codim} V_{i}=i} ,  meaning that π ( X ) ( V i ) ⊆ V i {\\displaystyle \\pi (X)(V_{i})\\subseteq V_{i}} for each X ∈ g {\\displaystyle X\\in {\\mathfrak {g}}} and i.","image":"436196f51414946f22139cfe6a6dfd012ed0682b.svg","url":"Lie's_theorem"}
