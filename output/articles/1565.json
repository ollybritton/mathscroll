{"title":"Biased graph","summary":"In mathematics, a biased graph is a graph with a list of distinguished circles (edge sets of simple cycles), such that if two circles in the list are contained in a theta graph, then the third circle of the theta graph is also in the list.  A biased graph is a generalization of the combinatorial essentials of a gain graph and in particular of a signed graph.","image":"3ea78da813f2d265a75a4f4334ec6022b503d93e.svg","url":"Biased_graph"}
