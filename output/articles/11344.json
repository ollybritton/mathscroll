{"title":"Octahedral symmetry","summary":"A regular octahedron has 24 rotational (or orientation-preserving) symmetries, and 48 symmetries altogether. These include transformations that combine a reflection and a rotation. A cube has the same set of symmetries, since it is the polyhedron that is dual to an octahedron.","image":"Sphere_symmetry_group_cs.png.webp","url":"Octahedral_symmetry"}
