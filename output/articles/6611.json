{"title":"Grothendieck–Katz p-curvature conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the Grothendieck–Katz p-curvature conjecture is a local-global principle for linear ordinary differential equations, related to differential Galois theory and in a loose sense analogous to the result in the Chebotarev density theorem considered as the polynomial case. It is a conjecture of Alexander Grothendieck from the late 1960s, and apparently not published by him in any form.","image":"bca53d1403c75b59f14be3dd9fe730147a1e7323.svg","url":"Grothendieck–Katz_p-curvature_conjecture"}
