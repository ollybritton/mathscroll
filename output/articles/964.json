{"title":"Argument (complex analysis)","summary":"In mathematics (particularly in complex analysis), the argument of a complex number z, denoted arg(z), is the angle between the positive real axis and the line joining the origin and z, represented as a point in the complex plane, shown as φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } in Figure 1. It is a multivalued function operating on the nonzero complex numbers. To define a single-valued function, the principal value of the argument (sometimes denoted Arg z) is used.  It is often chosen to be the unique value of the argument that lies within the interval (−π, π].[1][2]","image":"33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e.svg","url":"Argument_(complex_analysis)"}
