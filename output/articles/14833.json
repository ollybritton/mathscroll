{"title":"Splitter (geometry)","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, a splitter is a line segment through one of the vertices of a triangle (that is, a cevian) that bisects the perimeter of the triangle.[1][2] They are not to be confused with cleavers, which also bisect the perimeter but instead emanate from the midpoint of one of the triangle's sides.","image":"Extouch_Triangle_and_Nagel_Point.svg.png.webp","url":"Splitter_(geometry)"}
