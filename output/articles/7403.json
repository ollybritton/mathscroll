{"title":"Hopcroft–Karp algorithm","summary":"In computer science, the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm (sometimes more accurately called the Hopcroft–Karp–Karzanov algorithm)[1] is an algorithm that takes a bipartite graph as input and produces  a maximum-cardinality matching as output — a set of as many edges as possible with the property that no two edges share an endpoint. It runs in O ( | E | | V | ) {\\displaystyle O(|E|{\\sqrt {|V|}})} time in the worst case, where E {\\displaystyle E} is set of edges in the graph, V {\\displaystyle V} is set of vertices of the graph, and it is assumed that | E | = Ω ( | V | ) {\\displaystyle |E|=\\Omega (|V|)} . In the case of dense graphs the time bound becomes O ( | V | 2.5 ) {\\displaystyle O(|V|^{2.5})} , and for sparse random graphs it runs in time O ( | E | log ⁡ | V | ) {\\displaystyle O(|E|\\log |V|)} with high probability.[2]","image":"362a8b01b34078ce125908a35c39d5e59b71cc84.svg","url":"Hopcroft–Karp_algorithm"}
