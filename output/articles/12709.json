{"title":"Pseudo-uniform polyhedron","summary":"A pseudo-uniform polyhedron is a polyhedron which has regular polygons as faces and has the same vertex configuration at all vertices but is not vertex-transitive: it is not true that for any two vertices, there exists a symmetry of the polyhedron mapping the first isometrically onto the second. Thus, although all the vertices of a pseudo-uniform polyhedron appear the same, it is not isogonal. They are called pseudo-uniform polyhedra due to their resemblance to some true uniform polyhedra.","image":"Small_rhombicuboctahedron.png.webp","url":"Pseudo-uniform_polyhedron"}
