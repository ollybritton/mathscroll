{"title":"Bayes factor","summary":"The Bayes factor is a ratio of two competing statistical models represented by their evidence, and is used to quantify the support for one model over the other.[1] The models in questions can have a common set of parameters, such as a null hypothesis and an alternative, but this is not necessary; for instance, it could also be a non-linear model compared to its linear approximation. The Bayes factor can be thought of as a Bayesian analog to the likelihood-ratio test, but since it uses the (integrated) marginal likelihood rather than the maximized likelihood, both tests only coincide under simple hypotheses (e.g., two specific parameter values).[2] Also, in contrast with null hypothesis significance testing, Bayes factors support evaluation of evidence in favor of a null hypothesis, rather than only allowing the null to be rejected or not rejected.[3]","image":"Bayes_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Bayes_factor"}
