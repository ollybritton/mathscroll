{"title":"Non-squeezing theorem","summary":"The non-squeezing theorem, also called Gromov's non-squeezing theorem, is one of the most important theorems in symplectic geometry.[1]  It was first proven in 1985 by Mikhail Gromov.[2] The theorem states that one cannot embed a ball into a cylinder via a symplectic map unless the radius of the ball is less than or equal to the radius of the cylinder.  The theorem is important because formerly very little was known about the geometry behind symplectic maps.","image":"0279a328cbd51f6daf70ed47a29e99f91b2ea3c3.svg","url":"Non-squeezing_theorem"}
