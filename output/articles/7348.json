{"title":"Homeomorphism","summary":"In the mathematical field of topology, a homeomorphism (from Greek   ὅμοιος (homoios) 'similar, same', and  μορφή (morphē) 'shape, form', named by Henri Poincaré[1][2]), topological isomorphism, or bicontinuous function is a bijective and continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function. Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces—that is, they are the mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space. Two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called homeomorphic, and from a topological viewpoint they are the same.","image":"Mug_and_Torus_morph.gif","url":"Homeomorphism"}
