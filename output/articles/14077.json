{"title":"Selberg's zeta function conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the Selberg conjecture, named after Atle Selberg, is a theorem about the density of zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(1/2 + it). It is known that the function has infinitely many zeroes on this line in the complex plane: the point at issue is how densely they are clustered. Results on this can be formulated in terms of N(T), the function counting zeroes on the line for which the value of t satisfies 0 ≤ t ≤ T.","image":"e04ec3670b50384a3ce48aca42e7cc5131a06b12.svg","url":"Selberg's_zeta_function_conjecture"}
