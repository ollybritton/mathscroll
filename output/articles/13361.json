{"title":"Relative homology","summary":"In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, the (singular) homology of a topological space relative to a subspace is a construction in singular homology, for pairs of spaces. The relative homology is useful and important in several ways. Intuitively, it helps determine what part of an absolute homology group comes from which subspace.","image":"1dce86da0107830a9a97287f9486d9b4ff022875.svg","url":"Relative_homology"}
