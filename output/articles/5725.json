{"title":"Free variables and bound variables","summary":"In mathematics, and in other disciplines involving formal languages, including mathematical logic and computer science, a free variable is a notation (symbol) that specifies places in an expression where substitution may take place and is not a parameter of this or any container expression. Some older books use the terms real variable and apparent variable for free variable and bound variable, respectively. The idea is related to a placeholder (a symbol that will later be replaced by some value), or a wildcard character that stands for an unspecified symbol.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Free_variables_and_bound_variables"}
