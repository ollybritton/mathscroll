{"title":"Anti-de Sitter space","summary":"In mathematics and physics, n-dimensional anti-de Sitter space (AdSn) is a maximally symmetric Lorentzian manifold with constant negative scalar curvature. Anti-de Sitter space and de Sitter space are named after Willem de Sitter (1872â€“1934), professor of astronomy at Leiden University and director of the Leiden Observatory. Willem de Sitter and Albert Einstein worked together closely in Leiden in the 1920s on the spacetime structure of the universe.","image":"57591e16c7c32e5ea27199998e0317079358c652.svg","url":"Anti-de_Sitter_space"}
