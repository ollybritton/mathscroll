{"title":"NAND logic","summary":"The NAND Boolean function has the property of functional completeness. This means that any Boolean expression can be re-expressed by an equivalent expression utilizing only NAND operations. For example, the function NOT(x) may be equivalently expressed as NAND(x,x). In the field of digital electronic circuits, this implies that it is possible to implement any Boolean function using just NAND gates.","image":"NAND_ANSI_Labelled.svg.png.webp","url":"NAND_logic"}
