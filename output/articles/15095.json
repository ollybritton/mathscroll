{"title":"Stochastic tunneling","summary":"In numerical analysis, stochastic tunneling (STUN) is an approach to global optimization based on the Monte Carlo method-sampling of the function to be objective minimized in which the function is nonlinearly transformed to allow for easier tunneling among regions containing function minima. Easier tunneling allows for faster exploration of sample space and faster convergence to a good solution.","image":"Stun.jpg.webp","url":"Stochastic_tunneling"}
