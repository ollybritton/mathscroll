{"title":"Pyramid (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a pyramid (from Ancient Greek  πυραμίς (puramís))[1][2] is a polyhedron formed by connecting a polygonal base and a point, called the apex. Each base edge and apex form a triangle, called a lateral face. It is a conic solid with polygonal base.  A pyramid with an n-sided base has n + 1 vertices, n + 1 faces, and 2n edges. All pyramids are self-dual.","image":"Pyramid.svg.png.webp","url":"Pyramid_(geometry)"}
