{"title":"Transfer operator","summary":"In mathematics, the transfer operator encodes information about an iterated map and is frequently used to study the behavior of dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, quantum chaos and fractals. In all usual cases, the largest eigenvalue is 1, and the corresponding eigenvector is the invariant measure of the system.","image":"7fc989b42bdfd5a6cbf6f901340156fce82a8fc3.svg","url":"Transfer_operator"}
