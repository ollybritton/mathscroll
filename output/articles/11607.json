{"title":"Orthonormality","summary":"In linear algebra, two vectors in an inner product space are orthonormal if they are orthogonal (or perpendicular along a line) unit vectors. A set of vectors form an orthonormal set if all vectors in the set are mutually orthogonal and all of unit length. An orthonormal set which forms a basis is called an orthonormal basis.","image":"78c5ff99012396a180ab607d73030e68411a60df.svg","url":"Orthonormality"}
