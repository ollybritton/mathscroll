{"title":"Transformation semigroup","summary":"In algebra, a transformation semigroup (or composition semigroup) is a collection of transformations (functions from a set to itself) that is closed under function composition. If it includes the identity function, it is a monoid, called a transformation (or composition) monoid. This is the semigroup analogue of a permutation group.","image":"e94f94e3b62ae929b480d74063978cd2bde9e594.svg","url":"Transformation_semigroup"}
