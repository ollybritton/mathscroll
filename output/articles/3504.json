{"title":"Covariance group","summary":"In physics, a covariance group is a group of coordinate transformations between frames of reference (see for example Ryckman (2005)[1]). A frame of reference provides a set of coordinates for an observer moving with that frame to make measurements and define physical quantities. The covariance principle states the laws of physics should transform from one frame to another covariantly, that is, according to a representation of the covariance group.","image":"GPB_circling_earth.jpg.webp","url":"Covariance_group"}
