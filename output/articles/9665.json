{"title":"Logarithmic spiral","summary":"A logarithmic spiral, equiangular spiral, or growth spiral is a self-similar spiral curve that often appears in nature. The first to describe a logarithmic spiral was Albrecht DÃ¼rer (1525) who called it an \"eternal line\" (\"ewige Linie\").[1][2] More than a century later, the curve was discussed by Descartes (1638), and later extensively investigated by Jacob Bernoulli, who called it Spira mirabilis, \"the marvelous spiral\".","image":"Logarithmic_Spiral_Pylab.svg.png.webp","url":"Logarithmic_spiral"}
