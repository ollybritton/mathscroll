{"title":"Modular forms modulo p","summary":"In mathematics, modular forms are particular complex analytic functions on the upper half-plane of interest in complex analysis and number theory. When reduced modulo a prime p, there is an analogous theory to the classical theory of complex modular forms and the p-adic theory of modular forms.","image":"cbd4a07533fb952a40f930a40b1d7437aad86b26.svg","url":"Modular_forms_modulo_p"}
