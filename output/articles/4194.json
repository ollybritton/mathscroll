{"title":"Direction-preserving function","summary":"In discrete mathematics, a direction-preserving function (or mapping) is a function on a discrete space, such as the integer grid, that (informally) does not change too drastically between two adjacent points. It can be considered a discrete analogue of a continuous function.","image":"bb1f7738421378116efc981998b3bbdf2e97f750.svg","url":"Direction-preserving_function"}
