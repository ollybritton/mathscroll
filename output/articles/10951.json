{"title":"Natural bundle","summary":"In mathematics, a natural bundle is any fiber bundle associated to the s-frame bundle F s ( M ) {\\displaystyle F^{s}(M)} for some s â‰¥ 1 {\\displaystyle s\\geq 1} . It turns out that its transition functions depend functionally on local changes of coordinates in the base manifold M {\\displaystyle M} together with their partial derivatives up to order at most s {\\displaystyle s} .[1]","image":"e42cbd7da8f8fa781fbc78a0be2e2cd0873a8609.svg","url":"Natural_bundle"}
