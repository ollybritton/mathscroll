{"title":"C*-algebra","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in functional analysis, a Câˆ—-algebra (pronounced \"C-star\") is a Banach algebra together with an involution satisfying the properties of the adjoint. A particular case is that of a complex algebra A of continuous linear operators on a complex Hilbert space with two additional properties:","image":"ff8b02a2b4383e3de2771e332ae73ab7d1b66cfc.svg","url":"C*-algebra"}
