{"title":"Demiregular tiling","summary":"In geometry, the demiregular tilings are a set of Euclidean tessellations made from 2 or more regular polygon faces. Different authors have listed different sets of tilings. A more systematic approach looking at symmetry orbits are the 2-uniform tilings of which there are 20. Some of the demiregular ones are actually 3-uniform tilings.","image":"2-uniform_n4.svg.png.webp","url":"Demiregular_tiling"}
