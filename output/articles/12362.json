{"title":"Polyominoid","summary":"In geometry, a polyominoid (or minoid for short) is a set of equal squares in 3D space, joined edge to edge at 90- or 180-degree angles.  The polyominoids include the polyominoes, which are just the planar polyominoids.  The surface of a cube is an example of a hexominoid, or 6-cell polyominoid, and many other polycubes have polyominoids as their boundaries. Polyominoids appear to have been first proposed by Richard A. Epstein.[1]","image":"Polyominoids.svg.png.webp","url":"Polyominoid"}
