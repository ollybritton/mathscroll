{"title":"Minkowski's bound","summary":"In algebraic number theory, Minkowski's bound gives an upper bound of the norm of ideals to be checked in order to determine the class number of a number field K. It is named for the mathematician Hermann Minkowski.","image":"c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a.svg","url":"Minkowski's_bound"}
