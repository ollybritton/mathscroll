{"title":"Tridiagonal matrix algorithm","summary":"In numerical linear algebra, the tridiagonal matrix algorithm, also known as the Thomas algorithm (named after Llewellyn Thomas), is a simplified form of Gaussian elimination that can be used to solve tridiagonal systems of equations. A tridiagonal system for n unknowns may be written as","image":"9990bfe727a5051f3e6954f0bff903e15bbc2fd8.svg","url":"A%2fTridiagonal_matrix_algorithm"}
