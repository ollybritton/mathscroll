{"title":"BCJR algorithm","summary":"The BCJR algorithm is an algorithm for maximum a posteriori decoding of error correcting codes defined on trellises (principally convolutional codes).  The algorithm is named after its inventors: Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek and Raviv.[1]  This algorithm is critical to modern iteratively-decoded error-correcting codes, including turbo codes and low-density parity-check codes.","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg","url":"BCJR_algorithm"}
