{"title":"Distance (graph theory)","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the distance between two vertices in a graph is the number of edges in a shortest path (also called a graph geodesic) connecting them.  This is also known as the geodesic distance or shortest-path distance.[1] Notice that there may be more than one shortest path between two vertices.[2] If there is no path connecting the two vertices, i.e., if they belong to different connected components, then conventionally the distance is defined as infinite.","image":"524df5455221acd8c498d6756a9e6a83cd4c35e6.svg","url":"Distance_(graph_theory)"}
