{"title":"Kunita–Watanabe inequality","summary":"In stochastic calculus, the Kunita–Watanabe inequality is a generalization of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to integrals of stochastic processes. It was first obtained by Hiroshi Kunita and Shinzo Watanabe and plays a fundamental role in their extension of Ito's stochastic integral to square-integrable martingales.[1]","image":"c7d119f1c8afacfb62999734d69e9557f1228a4c.svg","url":"Kunita–Watanabe_inequality"}
