{"title":"Monus","summary":"In mathematics, monus is an operator on certain commutative monoids that are not groups. A commutative monoid on which a monus operator is defined is called a commutative monoid with monus, or CMM. The monus operator may be denoted with the − symbol because the natural numbers are a CMM under subtraction; it is also denoted with the − ˙ {\\displaystyle \\mathop {\\dot {-}} } symbol to distinguish it from the standard subtraction operator.","image":"fc650f83998c955754193ed0042356d9723ed167.svg","url":"Monus"}
