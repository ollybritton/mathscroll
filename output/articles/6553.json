{"title":"Great triambic icosahedron","summary":"In geometry, the great triambic icosahedron and medial triambic icosahedron (or midly triambic icosahedron) are visually identical dual uniform polyhedra. The exterior surface also represents the De2f2 stellation of the icosahedron. These figures can be differentiated by marking which intersections between edges are true vertices and which are not. In the above images, true vertices are marked by gold spheres, which can be seen in the concave Y-shaped areas. Alternatively, if the faces are filled with the evenâ€“odd rule, the internal structure of both shapes will differ.","image":"DU47_great_triambic_icosahedron.png.webp","url":"Great_triambic_icosahedron"}
