{"title":"∂","summary":"The character ∂ (Unicode: U+2202) is a stylized cursive d mainly used as a mathematical symbol, usually to denote a partial derivative such as ∂ z / ∂ x {\\displaystyle {\\partial z}/{\\partial x}} (read as \"the partial derivative of z with respect to x\").[1][2] It is also used for the boundary operator in a chain complex, and the conjugate of the Dolbeault operator on smooth differential forms over a complex manifold. It should be distinguished from other similar-looking symbols such as lowercase Greek letter delta (𝛿) or the lowercase Latin letter eth (ð).","image":"a4b98e69ede2ec25b5209584e5e471cf30822b8f.svg","url":"∂"}
