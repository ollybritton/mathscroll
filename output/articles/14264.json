{"title":"Sharp EL-8","summary":"The Sharp EL-8, also known as the ELSI-8,[1] was one of the earliest mass-produced hand-held electronic calculators[1] and the first hand-held calculator to be made by Sharp. Introduced around the start of 1971,[note 1] it was based on Sharp's preceding QT-8D and QT-8B compact desktop calculators and used the same logic circuits, but it was redesigned to fit in a much smaller case.","image":"Sharp_EL-8.JPG.webp","url":"Sharp_EL-8"}
