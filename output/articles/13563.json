{"title":"Riemann–Silberstein vector","summary":"In mathematical physics, in particular electromagnetism, the Riemann–Silberstein vector[1] or Weber vector[2][3] named after Bernhard Riemann, Heinrich Martin Weber and Ludwik Silberstein, (or sometimes ambiguously called the \"electromagnetic field\") is a complex vector that combines the electric field E and the magnetic field B.","image":"VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png.webp","url":"Riemann–Silberstein_vector"}
