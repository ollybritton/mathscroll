{"title":"Extension by new constant and function names","summary":"In mathematical logic, a theory can be extended with new constants or function names under certain conditions with assurance that the extension will introduce no contradiction. Extension by definitions is perhaps the best-known approach, but it requires unique existence of an object with the desired property.  Addition of new names can also be done safely without uniqueness.","image":"ea7eea8fefe6f842aab55e5e8de83a183a73b613.svg","url":"Extension_by_new_constant_and_function_names"}
