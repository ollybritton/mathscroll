{"title":"Euclid–Euler theorem","summary":"The Euclid–Euler theorem is a theorem in number theory that relates perfect numbers to Mersenne primes. It states that an even number is perfect if and only if it has the form 2p−1(2p − 1), where 2p − 1 is a prime number. The theorem is named after mathematicians Euclid and Leonhard Euler, who respectively proved the \"if\" and \"only if\" aspects of the theorem.","image":"fc39cd97ca61f6b70756a9019299e194d4927be1.svg","url":"Euclid–Euler_theorem"}
