{"title":"Schur polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, Schur polynomials, named after Issai Schur, are certain symmetric polynomials in n variables, indexed by partitions, that generalize the elementary symmetric polynomials and the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials.  In representation theory  they are the characters of polynomial irreducible representations of the general linear groups. The Schur polynomials form a linear basis for the space of all symmetric polynomials.  Any product of Schur polynomials can be written as a linear combination of Schur polynomials with non-negative integral coefficients; the values of these coefficients is given combinatorially by the Littlewoodâ€“Richardson rule. More generally, skew Schur polynomials  are associated with pairs of partitions and have similar properties to Schur polynomials.","image":"7c63c9c4a494ea6c3ba90d0f4a1e24005a89ded9.svg","url":"Schur_polynomial"}
