{"title":"Equating coefficients","summary":"In mathematics, the method of equating the coefficients is a way of solving a functional equation of two expressions such as  polynomials for a number of unknown parameters. It relies on the fact that two expressions are identical precisely when corresponding coefficients are equal for each different type of term. The method is used to bring formulas into a desired form.","image":"9c9e54f6d0660097b70afc8884d63f2c05cb0e2c.svg","url":"Equating_coefficients"}
