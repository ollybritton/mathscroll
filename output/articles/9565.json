{"title":"List of uniform polyhedra","summary":"In geometry, a uniform polyhedron is a polyhedron which has regular polygons as faces and is vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices, isogonal, i.e. there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other). It follows that all vertices are congruent, and the polyhedron has a high degree of reflectional and rotational symmetry.","image":"Tetrahedron.png.webp","url":"List_of_uniform_polyhedra"}
