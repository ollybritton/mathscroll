{"title":"Applications of dual quaternions to 2D geometry","summary":"In this article, we discuss certain applications of the dual quaternion algebra to 2D geometry. At this present time, the article is focused on a 4-dimensional subalgebra of the dual quaternions which we will call the planar quaternions.","image":"0ffafff1ad26cbe49045f19a67ce532116a32703.svg","url":"Applications_of_dual_quaternions_to_2D_geometry"}
