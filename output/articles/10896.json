{"title":"NLTS conjecture","summary":"In quantum information theory, the no low-energy trivial state (NLTS) conjecture is a precursor to a quantum PCP theorem (qPCP) and posits the existence of families of Hamiltonians with all low-energy states of non-trivial complexity.[1][2][3][4] An NLTS proof would be a consequence of one aspect of qPCP problems –  the inability to certify an approximation of local Hamiltonians via NP completeness.[2] In other words, an NLTS proof would be one consequence of the QMA complexity of qPCP problems.[5] On a high level, if proved, NLTS would be one property of the non-Newtonian complexity of quantum computation.[5] NLTS and qPCP conjectures posit the near-infinite complexity involved in predicting the outcome of quantum systems with many interacting states.[6] These calculations of complexity would have implications for quantum computing such as the stability of entangled states at higher temperatures, and the occurrence of entanglement in natural systems.[7][6] There is currently a proof of NLTS conjecture published in preprint.[8]","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"NLTS_conjecture"}
