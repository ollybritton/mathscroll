{"title":"Siegel upper half-space","summary":"In mathematics, the Siegel upper half-space of degree g (or genus g) (also called the Siegel upper half-plane) is the set of g × g symmetric matrices over the complex numbers whose imaginary part is positive definite. It was introduced by Siegel (1939). It is the symmetric space associated to the symplectic group Sp(2g, R).","image":"cdae1052e3284fe3027ea43060bfb65293a2ae08.svg","url":"Siegel_upper_half-space"}
