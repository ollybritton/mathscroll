{"title":"Adams spectral sequence","summary":"In mathematics, the Adams spectral sequence is a spectral sequence introduced by J. Frank AdamsÂ (1958) which computes the stable homotopy groups of topological spaces. Like all spectral sequences, it is a computational tool; it relates homology theory to what is now called stable homotopy theory. It is a reformulation using homological algebra, and an extension, of a technique called 'killing homotopy groups' applied by the French school of Henri Cartan and Jean-Pierre Serre.","image":"a4f3c2f4799ff900e1a1b7f23b60f226b02b7c5a.svg","url":"Adams_spectral_sequence"}
