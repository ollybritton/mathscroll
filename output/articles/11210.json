{"title":"Normal (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, a normal is an object such as a line, ray, or vector that is perpendicular to a given object. For example, the normal line to a plane curve at a given point is the (infinite) line perpendicular to the tangent line to the curve at the point. A normal vector may have length one (in which case it is a unit normal vector) or its length may represent the curvature of the object (a curvature vector); its algebraic sign may indicate sides (interior or exterior).","image":"Normal_vectors2.svg.png.webp","url":"Normal_(geometry)"}
