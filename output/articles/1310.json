{"title":"Band model","summary":"In geometry, the band model is a conformal model of the hyperbolic plane. The band model employs a portion of the Euclidean plane between two parallel lines.[1] Distance is preserved along one line through the middle of the band. Assuming the band is given by { z ∈ C : | Im ⁡ z | < π / 2 } {\\displaystyle \\{z\\in \\mathbb {C} :\\left|\\operatorname {Im} z\\right|<\\pi /2\\}} , the metric is given by | d z | sec ⁡ ( Im ⁡ z ) {\\displaystyle |dz|\\sec(\\operatorname {Im} z)} .","image":"8a8d5b905c5ccdb394cc3779cabf17c87409306a.svg","url":"Band_model"}
