{"title":"Stable map","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in symplectic topology and algebraic geometry, one can construct the moduli space of stable maps, satisfying specified conditions, from Riemann surfaces into a given symplectic manifold. This moduli space is the essence of the Gromovâ€“Witten invariants, which find application in enumerative geometry and type IIA string theory. The idea of stable map was proposed by Maxim Kontsevich around 1992 and published in Kontsevich (1995).","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Stable_map"}
