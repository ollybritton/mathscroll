{"title":"Pure inductive logic","summary":"Pure inductive logic (PIL) is the area of mathematical logic concerned with the philosophical and mathematical foundations of probabilistic inductive reasoning. It combines classical predicate logic and probability theory (Bayesian inference). Probability values are assigned to sentences of a first-order relational language to represent degrees of belief that should be held by a rational agent. Conditional probability values represent degrees of belief based on the assumption of some received evidence.","image":"909f19d6fc90c36ea047695dea9d21aafad559e2.svg","url":"Pure_inductive_logic"}
