{"title":"Fox n-coloring","summary":"In the mathematical field of knot theory, Fox n-coloring is a method of specifying a representation of a knot group or a group of a link (not to be confused with a link group) onto the dihedral group of order n where n is an odd integer by coloring arcs in a link diagram (the representation itself is also often called a Fox n-coloring). Ralph Fox discovered this method (and the special case of tricolorability) \"in an effort to make the subject accessible to everyone\" when he was explaining knot theory to undergraduate students at Haverford College in 1956. Fox n-coloring is an example of a conjugation quandle.","image":"9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a.svg","url":"Fox_n-coloring"}
