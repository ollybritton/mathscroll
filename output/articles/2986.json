{"title":"Complete theory","summary":"In mathematical logic, a theory  is complete if it is consistent and for every closed formula in the theory's language, either that formula or its negation is provable. That is, for every sentence φ , {\\displaystyle \\varphi ,} the theory T {\\displaystyle T} contains the sentence or its negation but not both (that is, either T ⊢ φ {\\displaystyle T\\vdash \\varphi } or T ⊢ ¬ φ {\\displaystyle T\\vdash \\neg \\varphi } ). Recursively axiomatizable first-order theories that are consistent and rich enough to allow general mathematical reasoning to be formulated cannot be complete, as demonstrated by Gödel's first incompleteness theorem.","image":"aeb4baf1e617abd3f5384bab1851bf109ea0b614.svg","url":"Complete_theory"}
