{"title":"Hasse norm theorem","summary":"In number theory, the Hasse norm theorem states that if L/K is a cyclic extension of number fields, then if a nonzero element of K is a local norm everywhere, then it is a global norm. Here to be a global norm means to be an element k of K such that there is an element l of L with N L / K ( l ) = k {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {N} _{L/K}(l)=k} ; in other words k is a relative norm of some element of the extension field L. To be a local norm means that for some prime p of K and some prime P of L lying over K, then k is a norm from LP; here the \"prime\" p can be an archimedean valuation, and the theorem is a statement about completions in all valuations, archimedean and non-archimedean.","image":"284b88f1c4937edc856251d12237290229c87701.svg","url":"Hasse_norm_theorem"}
