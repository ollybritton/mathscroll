{"title":"Limit point compact","summary":"In mathematics, a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} is said to be limit point compact[1][2] or weakly countably compact[3] if every infinite subset of X {\\displaystyle X} has a limit point in X . {\\displaystyle X.} This property  generalizes a property of compact spaces.  In a metric space, limit point compactness, compactness, and sequential compactness are all equivalent.  For general topological spaces, however, these three notions of compactness are not equivalent.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Limit_point_compact"}
