{"title":"Karatsuba algorithm","summary":"The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm. It was discovered by Anatoly Karatsuba in 1960 and published in 1962.[1][2][3] It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that reduces the multiplication of two n-digit numbers to three multiplications of n/2-digit numbers and, by repeating this reduction, to  at most n log 2 ⁡ 3 ≈ n 1.58 {\\displaystyle n^{\\log _{2}3}\\approx n^{1.58}} single-digit multiplications. It is therefore asymptotically faster than the traditional algorithm, which performs n 2 {\\displaystyle n^{2}} single-digit products. For example, to multiply two 1024-digit numbers (n = 1024 = 210), the traditional algorithm requires (210)2 = 1,048,576 single-digit multiplications, whereas the Karatsuba algorithm requires 310 = 59,049 thus being ~17.758 times faster.","image":"513d063dc093e12ff06009c8f6fbd2e2dca2949c.svg","url":"Karatsuba_algorithm"}
