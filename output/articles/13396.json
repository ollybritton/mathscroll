{"title":"Representation theory of Hopf algebras","summary":"In abstract algebra, a representation of a Hopf algebra is a representation of its underlying associative algebra. That is, a representation of a Hopf algebra H over a field K is a K-vector space V with an action H × V → V usually denoted by juxtaposition ( that is, the image of (h,v) is written hv ). The vector space V is called an H-module.","image":"1cc67c215f31fe24a383a3ea036f0f31138a042b.svg","url":"Representation_theory_of_Hopf_algebras"}
