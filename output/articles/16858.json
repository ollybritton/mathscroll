{"title":"Weyl group","summary":"In mathematics, in particular the theory of Lie algebras, the Weyl group (named after Hermann Weyl) of a root system Î¦ is a subgroup of the isometry group of that root system. Specifically, it is the subgroup which is generated by reflections through the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots, and as such is a finite reflection group. In fact it turns out that most finite reflection groups are Weyl groups.[1] Abstractly, Weyl groups are finite Coxeter groups, and are important examples of these.","image":"E8Petrie.svg.png.webp","url":"Weyl_group"}
