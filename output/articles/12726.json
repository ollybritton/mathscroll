{"title":"Pseudometric space","summary":"In mathematics, a pseudometric space is a generalization of a metric space in which the distance between two distinct points can be zero. Pseudometric spaces were introduced by ƒêuro Kurepa[1][2] in 1934. In the same way as every normed space is a metric space, every seminormed space is a pseudometric space. Because of this analogy the term semimetric space (which has a different meaning in topology) is sometimes used as a synonym, especially in functional analysis.","image":"cb4d7a16bca9e216c0221b43a1c3377aa5e358b8.svg","url":"Pseudometric_space"}
