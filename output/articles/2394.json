{"title":"Cayley table","summary":"Named after the 19th century British mathematician Arthur Cayley, a Cayley table describes the structure of a finite group by arranging all the possible products of all the group's elements in a square table reminiscent of an addition or multiplication table.  Many properties of a group – such as whether or not it is abelian, which elements are inverses of which elements, and the size and contents of the group's center – can be discovered from its Cayley table.","image":"ebe39cd5b70c1c6b7e467d25b61554b02b1bd122.svg","url":"Cayley_table"}
