{"title":"Hilbert–Burch theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Hilbert–Burch theorem describes the structure of some free resolutions of a quotient of a local or graded ring in the case that the quotient has projective dimension 2. Hilbert (1890) proved a version of this theorem for polynomial rings, and Burch (1968, p. 944) proved a more general version. Several other authors later rediscovered and published variations of this theorem. Eisenbud (1995, theorem 20.15) gives a statement and proof.","image":"90c063039c137a343e85f50b03e1c1f8715eddca.svg","url":"Hilbert–Burch_theorem"}
