{"title":"Stellation","summary":"In geometry, stellation is the process of extending a polygon in two dimensions, polyhedron in three dimensions, or, in general, a polytope in n dimensions to form a new figure. Starting with an original figure, the process extends specific elements such as its edges or face planes, usually in a symmetrical way, until they meet each other again to form the closed boundary of a new figure. The new figure is a stellation of the original. The word stellation comes from the Latin stellƒÅtus, \"starred\", which in turn comes from Latin stella, \"star\". Stellation is the reciprocal or dual process to faceting.","image":"Academ_Stellated_dodecagon.svg.png.webp","url":"Stellation"}
