{"title":"Soil moisture velocity equation","summary":"The soil moisture velocity equation[1] describes the speed that water moves vertically through unsaturated soil under the combined actions of gravity and capillarity, a process known as infiltration.  The equation is alternative form of the Richardson/Richards' equation.[2][3]  The key difference being that the dependent variable is the position of the wetting front z {\\displaystyle z} , which is a function of time, the water content and media properties.  The soil moisture velocity equation consists of two terms.  The first \"advection-like\" term was developed to simulate surface infiltration [4] and was extended to the water table,[5] which was verified using data collected in a column experimental that was patterned after the famous experiment by Childs & Poulovassilis (1962)[6] and against exact solutions.[7][1]","image":"bf368e72c009decd9b6686ee84a375632e11de98.svg","url":"Soil_moisture_velocity_equation"}
