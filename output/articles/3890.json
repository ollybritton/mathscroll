{"title":"Degeneracy (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, a k-degenerate graph is an undirected graph in which every subgraph has a vertex of degree at most k: that is, some vertex in the subgraph touches k or fewer of the subgraph's edges. The degeneracy of a graph is the smallest value of k for which it is k-degenerate. The degeneracy of a graph is a measure of how sparse it is, and is within a constant factor of other sparsity measures such as the arboricity of a graph.","image":"2-degenerate_graph_2-core.svg.png.webp","url":"Degeneracy_(graph_theory)"}
