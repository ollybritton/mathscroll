{"title":"Lune of Hippocrates","summary":"In geometry, the lune of Hippocrates, named after Hippocrates of Chios, is a lune bounded by arcs of two circles, the smaller of which has as its diameter a chord spanning a right angle on the larger circle.  Equivalently, it is a non-convex plane region bounded by one 180-degree circular arc and one 90-degree circular arc. It was the first curved figure to have its exact area calculated mathematically.[1]","image":"Lune.svg.png.webp","url":"Lune_of_Hippocrates"}
