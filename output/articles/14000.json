{"title":"Schwarz function","summary":"The Schwarz function of a curve in the complex plane is an analytic function which maps the points of the curve to their complex conjugates. It can be used to generalize the Schwarz reflection principle to reflection across arbitrary analytic curves, not just across the real axis.","image":"4cfde86a3f7ec967af9955d0988592f0693d2b19.svg","url":"Schwarz_function"}
