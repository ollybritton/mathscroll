{"title":"Schur complement method","summary":"In numerical analysis, the Schur complement method, named after Issai Schur, is the basic and the earliest version of non-overlapping domain decomposition method, also called iterative substructuring. A finite element problem is split into non-overlapping subdomains, and the unknowns in the interiors of the subdomains are eliminated. The remaining Schur complement system on the unknowns associated with subdomain interfaces is solved by the conjugate gradient method.","image":"8e2f469e97b50bdaf9378c3d9306cf6c947458da.svg","url":"Schur_complement_method"}
