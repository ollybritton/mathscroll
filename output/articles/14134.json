{"title":"Semiorthogonal decomposition","summary":"In mathematics, a semiorthogonal decomposition is a way to divide a triangulated category into simpler pieces. One way to produce a semiorthogonal decomposition is from an exceptional collection, a special sequence of objects in a triangulated category. For an algebraic variety X, it has been fruitful to study semiorthogonal decompositions of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves, D b ( X ) {\\displaystyle {\\text{D}}^{\\text{b}}(X)} .","image":"d086488cf043b29b2657308a6de2b0134c976835.svg","url":"Semiorthogonal_decomposition"}
