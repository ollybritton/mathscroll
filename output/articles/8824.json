{"title":"Koszul cohomology","summary":"In mathematics, the Koszul cohomology groups K p , q ( X , L ) {\\displaystyle K_{p,q}(X,L)} are groups associated to a projective variety X with a line bundle L. They were introduced by Mark GreenÂ (1984, 1984b), and named after Jean-Louis Koszul as they are closely related to the Koszul complex.","image":"da27ce6e0b60a349e469f840986b99a01fc60c96.svg","url":"Koszul_cohomology"}
