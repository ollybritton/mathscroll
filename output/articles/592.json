{"title":"Algebraic fraction","summary":"In algebra, an algebraic fraction is a fraction whose numerator and denominator are algebraic expressions. Two examples of algebraic fractions are 3 x x 2 + 2 x − 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3x}{x^{2}+2x-3}}} and x + 2 x 2 − 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\sqrt {x+2}}{x^{2}-3}}} . Algebraic fractions are subject to the same laws as arithmetic fractions.","image":"a9528916dc5bde960b37350dfadb11c5c549ebfe.svg","url":"Algebraic_fraction"}
