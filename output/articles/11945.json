{"title":"Penrose graphical notation","summary":"In mathematics and physics, Penrose graphical notation or tensor diagram notation is a (usually handwritten) visual depiction of multilinear functions or tensors proposed by Roger Penrose in 1971.[1] A diagram in the notation consists of several shapes linked together by lines. The notation has been studied extensively by Predrag CvitanoviÄ‡, who used it,  Feynman's diagrams and other related notations in developing birdtracks (a group-theoretical version of Feynman diagrams) to classify the classical Lie groups.[2] Penrose's notation has also been generalized using representation theory to spin networks in physics, and with the presence of matrix groups to trace diagrams in linear algebra.  The notation widely appears in modern quantum theory, particularly in matrix product states and quantum circuits.","image":"Matrix_product_state_obc_tikz.svg.png.webp","url":"Penrose_graphical_notation"}
