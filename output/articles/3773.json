{"title":"Darboux derivative","summary":"The Darboux derivative of a map between a manifold and a Lie group is a variant of the standard derivative. It is arguably a more natural generalization of the single-variable derivative. It allows a generalization of the single-variable fundamental theorem of calculus to higher dimensions, in a different vein than the generalization that is Stokes' theorem.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Darboux_derivative"}
