{"title":"MV-algebra","summary":"In abstract algebra, a branch of pure mathematics, an MV-algebra is an algebraic structure with a binary operation ⊕ {\\displaystyle \\oplus } , a unary operation ¬ {\\displaystyle \\neg } , and the constant 0 {\\displaystyle 0} , satisfying certain axioms. MV-algebras are the algebraic semantics of Łukasiewicz logic; the letters MV refer to the many-valued logic of Łukasiewicz. MV-algebras coincide with the class of bounded commutative BCK algebras.","image":"8b16e2bdaefee9eed86d866e6eba3ac47c710f60.svg","url":"MV-algebra"}
