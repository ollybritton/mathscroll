{"title":"h-vector","summary":"In algebraic combinatorics, the h-vector of a simplicial polytope is a fundamental invariant of the polytope which encodes the number of faces of different dimensions and allows one to express the Dehnâ€“Sommerville equations in a particularly simple form. A characterization of the set of h-vectors of simplicial polytopes was conjectured by Peter McMullen[1] and proved by Lou Billera and Carl W. Lee[2][3] and Richard Stanley[4] (g-theorem). The definition of h-vector applies to arbitrary abstract simplicial complexes. The g-conjecture stated that for simplicial spheres, all possible h-vectors occur already among the h-vectors of the boundaries of convex simplicial polytopes. It was proven in December 2018 by Karim Adiprasito.[5][6]","image":"2635a0f910d0241cc4e820db7bd110e30300e66f.svg","url":"H-vector"}
