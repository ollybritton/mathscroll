{"title":"Free product","summary":"In mathematics, specifically group theory, the free product is an operation that takes two groups G and H and constructs a new group G ∗ H.  The result contains both G and H as subgroups, is generated by the elements of these subgroups, and is the “universal” group having these properties, in the sense that any two homomorphisms from G and H into a group K factor uniquely through a homomorphism from G ∗ H to K.  Unless one of the groups G and H is trivial, the free product is always infinite.  The construction of a free product is similar in spirit to the construction of a free group (the universal group with a given set of generators).","image":"d11d32b285372aa62f89e8b0988da8266bc5795a.svg","url":"Free_product"}
