{"title":"Exp algebra","summary":"In mathematics, an exp algebra is a Hopf algebra Exp(G) constructed from an abelian group G, and is the universal ring R such that there is an exponential map from G to the group of the power series in R[[t]] with constant term 1. In other words the functor Exp from abelian groups to commutative rings is adjoint to the functor from commutative rings to abelian groups taking a ring to the group of formal power series with constant term 1.","image":"2c6cbf7592028c661768d16f33a85794d9684494.svg","url":"Exp_algebra"}
