{"title":"Ramanujan summation","summary":"Ramanujan summation is a technique invented by the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan for assigning a value to divergent infinite series. Although the Ramanujan summation of a divergent series is not a sum in the traditional sense, it has properties that make it mathematically useful in the study of divergent infinite series, for which conventional summation is undefined.","image":"dd444ca8dd2969b1a6f8d4b865d6dd073e5b2bf8.svg","url":"Ramanujan_summation"}
