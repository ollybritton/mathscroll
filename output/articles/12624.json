{"title":"Projective space","summary":"In mathematics, the concept of a projective space originated from the visual effect of perspective, where parallel lines seem to meet at infinity. A projective space may thus be viewed as the extension of a Euclidean space, or, more generally, an affine space with points at infinity, in such a way that there is one point at infinity of each direction of parallel lines.","image":"Railroad-Tracks-Perspective.jpg.webp","url":"Projective_space"}
