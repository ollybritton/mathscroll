{"title":"Center of mass","summary":"In physics, the center of mass of a distribution of mass in space (sometimes referred to as the balance point) is the unique point at any given time where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero. This is the point to which a force may be applied to cause a linear acceleration without an angular acceleration. Calculations in mechanics are often simplified when formulated with respect to the center of mass. It is a hypothetical point where the entire mass of an object may be assumed to be concentrated to visualise its motion. In other words, the center of mass is the particle equivalent of a given object for application of Newton's laws of motion.","image":"Bird_toy_showing_center_of_gravity.jpg.webp","url":"Center_of_mass"}
