{"title":"Conditioning (probability)","summary":"Beliefs depend on the available information. This idea is formalized in probability theory by conditioning. Conditional probabilities, conditional expectations, and conditional probability distributions are treated on three levels: discrete probabilities, probability density functions, and measure theory. Conditioning leads to a non-random result if the condition is completely specified; otherwise, if the condition is left random, the result of conditioning is also random.","image":"053482f6a71723d8c38ec1b4c5cf7229bf0df171.svg","url":"Conditioning_(probability)"}
