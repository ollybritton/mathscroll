{"title":"State (functional analysis)","summary":"In functional analysis, a state of an operator system is a positive linear functional of norm 1. States in functional analysis generalize the notion of density matrices in quantum mechanics, which represent quantum states, both §§ Mixed states​ and pure states. Density matrices in turn generalize state vectors, which only represent pure states.  For M an operator system in a C*-algebra A with identity, the set of all states of M, sometimes denoted by S(M),  is convex, weak-* closed in the Banach dual space M*. Thus the set of all states of M with the weak-* topology forms a compact Hausdorff space, known as the state space of M .","image":"38a7dcde9730ef0853809fefc18d88771f95206c.svg","url":"State_(functional_analysis)"}
