{"title":"Jumping line","summary":"In mathematics, a jumping line or exceptional line of a vector bundle over projective space is a projective line in projective space where the vector bundle has exceptional behavior, in other words the structure of its restriction to the line \"jumps\". Jumping lines were introduced by R. L. E. SchwarzenbergerÂ (1961). The jumping lines of a vector bundle form a proper closed subset of the Grassmannian of all lines of projective space.","image":"2f02cfe21a83e074d5589b15f2e5f0947cb39c4d.svg","url":"Jumping_line"}
