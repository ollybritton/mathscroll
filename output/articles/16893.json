{"title":"Whitney inequality","summary":"In mathematics, the Whitney inequality gives an upper bound for the error of best approximation of a function by polynomials in terms of the moduli of smoothness. It was first proved by Hassler Whitney in 1957,[1] and is an important tool in the field of approximation theory for obtaining upper estimates on the errors of best approximation.","image":"e35a84e8df64b276d8617c4ce40b9a2dd5bfe6a5.svg","url":"Whitney_inequality"}
