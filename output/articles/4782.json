{"title":"Elongated pentagonal orthocupolarotunda","summary":"In geometry, the elongated pentagonal orthocupolarotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J40). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal orthocupolarotunda (J32) by inserting a decagonal prism between its halves. Rotating either the cupola or the rotunda through 36 degrees before inserting the prism yields an elongated pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda (J41).","image":"Elongated_pentagonal_orthocupolarotunda.png.webp","url":"Elongated_pentagonal_orthocupolarotunda"}
