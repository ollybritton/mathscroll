{"title":"Universal embedding theorem","summary":"The universal embedding theorem, or Krasner–Kaloujnine universal embedding theorem, is a theorem from the mathematical discipline of group theory first published in 1951 by Marc Krasner and Lev Kaluznin.[1] The theorem states that any group extension of a group H by a group A is isomorphic to a subgroup of the regular wreath product A Wr H. The theorem is named for the fact that the group A Wr H is said to be universal with respect to all extensions of H by A.","image":"ffd62c68938623d5d8d5f7b29ac48ad57a50bf72.svg","url":"Universal_embedding_theorem"}
