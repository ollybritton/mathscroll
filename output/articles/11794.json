{"title":"Parameterized approximation algorithm","summary":"A parameterized approximation algorithm is a type of algorithm that aims to find approximate solutions to NP-hard optimization problems in polynomial time in the input size and a function of a specific parameter. These algorithms are designed to combine the best aspects of both traditional approximation algorithms and fixed-parameter tractability.","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg","url":"Parameterized_approximation_algorithm"}
