{"title":"Ehrhart's volume conjecture","summary":"In the geometry of numbers, Ehrhart's volume conjecture gives an upper bound on the volume of a convex body containing only one lattice point in its interior.  It is a kind of converse to Minkowski's theorem, which guarantees that a centrally symmetric convex body K must contain a lattice point as soon as its volume exceeds 2 n {\\displaystyle 2^{n}} .  The conjecture states that a convex body K containing only one lattice point in its interior as its barycenter cannot have volume greater than ( n + 1 ) n / n ! {\\displaystyle (n+1)^{n}/n!} :","image":"8226f30650ee4fe4e640c6d2798127e80e9c160d.svg","url":"Ehrhart's_volume_conjecture"}
