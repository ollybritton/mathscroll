{"title":"Formal derivative","summary":"In mathematics, the formal derivative is an operation on elements of a polynomial ring or a ring of formal power series that mimics the form of the derivative from calculus.  Though they appear similar, the algebraic advantage of a formal derivative is that it does not rely on the notion of a limit, which is in general impossible to define for a ring.  Many of the properties of the derivative are true of the formal derivative, but some, especially those that make numerical statements, are not.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Formal_derivative"}
