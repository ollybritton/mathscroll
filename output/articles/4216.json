{"title":"Dirichlet energy","summary":"In mathematics, the Dirichlet energy is a measure of how variable a function is.  More abstractly, it is a quadratic functional on the Sobolev space H1.  The Dirichlet energy is intimately connected to Laplace's equation and is named after the German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.","image":"77650ec89ffc129b298660f8625ed95580e37643.svg","url":"Dirichlet_energy"}
