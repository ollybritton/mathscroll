{"title":"Noncommutative torus","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in the theory of C*-algebras, the noncommutative tori Aθ, also known as irrational rotation algebras for irrational values of θ, form a family of noncommutative C*-algebras which generalize the algebra of continuous functions on the 2-torus. Many topological and geometric properties of the classical 2-torus have algebraic analogues for the noncommutative tori, and as such they are fundamental examples of a noncommutative space in the sense of Alain Connes.","image":"485f905e5b2e52d17afc3df95fac9ebe41e7523b.svg","url":"Noncommutative_torus"}
