{"title":"Zakai equation","summary":"In filtering theory the Zakai equation is a linear stochastic partial differential equation for the un-normalized density of a hidden state.  In contrast, the Kushner equation gives a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation for the normalized density of the hidden state.  In principle either approach allows one to estimate a quantity function (the state of a dynamical system) from noisy measurements, even when the system is non-linear (thus generalizing the earlier results of Wiener and Kalman for linear systems and solving a central problem in estimation theory).  The application of this approach to a specific engineering situation may be problematic however, as these equations are quite complex.[1][2] The Zakai equation is a bilinear stochastic partial differential equation. It was named after Moshe Zakai.[3]","image":"f01df03d6dddddc128f1462d72e0b8443ff5f63a.svg","url":"Zakai_equation"}
