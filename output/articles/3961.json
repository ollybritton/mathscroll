{"title":"Densely defined operator","summary":"In mathematics – specifically, in operator theory – a densely defined operator or partially defined operator is a type of partially defined function. In a topological sense, it is a linear operator that is defined \"almost everywhere\".  Densely defined operators often arise in functional analysis as operations that one would like to apply to a larger class of objects than those for which they a priori \"make sense\".","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Densely_defined_operator"}
