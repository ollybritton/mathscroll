{"title":"Constrained least squares","summary":"In constrained least squares one solves a linear least squares problem with an additional constraint on the solution.[1][2] This means, the unconstrained equation X β = y {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {X} {\\boldsymbol {\\beta }}=\\mathbf {y} } must be fit as closely as possible (in the least squares sense) while ensuring that some other property of β {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {\\beta }}} is maintained.","image":"0cac22949faaeb647fc5b7e67eeb259bc833a2a3.svg","url":"Constrained_least_squares"}
