{"title":"Sigurður Helgason (mathematician)","summary":"Sigurdur Helgason (born 30 September 1927; Icelandic: Sigurður) is an Icelandic mathematician whose research has been devoted to the geometry and analysis on symmetric spaces. In particular, he has used new integral geometric methods to establish fundamental existence theorems for differential equations on symmetric spaces as well as some new results on the representations of their isometry groups. He also introduced a Fourier transform on these spaces and proved the principal theorems for this transform, the inversion formula, the Plancherel theorem and the analog of the Paley–Wiener theorem.","image":"Sigurdur_Helgason.jpg.webp","url":"Sigurður_Helgason_(mathematician)"}
