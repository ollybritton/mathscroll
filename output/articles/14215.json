{"title":"Seshadri constant","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a Seshadri constant is an invariant of an ample line bundle L at a point P on an algebraic variety. It was introduced by Demailly to measure a certain rate of growth, of the tensor powers of L, in terms of the jets of the sections of the Lk. The object was the study of the Fujita conjecture.","image":"b304d4de2976f610f0bb24237028399681e16a81.svg","url":"Seshadri_constant"}
