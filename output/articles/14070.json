{"title":"Seidel adjacency matrix","summary":"In mathematics, in graph theory, the Seidel adjacency matrix of a simple undirected graph G is a symmetric matrix with a row and column for each vertex, having 0 on the diagonal, −1 for positions whose rows and columns correspond to adjacent vertices, and +1 for positions corresponding to non-adjacent vertices. It is also called the Seidel matrix or—its original name—the (−1,1,0)-adjacency matrix. It can be interpreted as the result of subtracting the adjacency matrix of G from the adjacency matrix of the complement of G.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Seidel_adjacency_matrix"}
