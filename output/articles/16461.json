{"title":"Upper topology","summary":"In mathematics, the upper topology on a partially ordered set X is the coarsest topology in which the closure of a singleton { a } {\\displaystyle \\{a\\}} is the order section a ] = { x ≤ a } {\\displaystyle a]=\\{x\\leq a\\}} for each a ∈ X . {\\displaystyle a\\in X.} If ≤ {\\displaystyle \\leq } is a partial order, the upper topology is the least order consistent topology in which all open sets are up-sets.  However, not all up-sets must necessarily be open sets. The lower topology induced by the preorder is defined similarly in terms of the down-sets. The preorder inducing the upper topology is its specialization preorder, but the specialization preorder of the lower topology is opposite to the inducing preorder.","image":"ae00d3f70c2221d5933b6b03d14b1df54756c8ee.svg","url":"Upper_topology"}
