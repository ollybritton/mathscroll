{"title":"Birkhoff polytope","summary":"The Birkhoff polytope Bn (also called the assignment polytope, the polytope of doubly stochastic matrices, or the perfect matching polytope of the complete bipartite graph K n , n {\\displaystyle K_{n,n}} [1]) is the convex polytope in RN (where N = n2) whose points are the doubly stochastic matrices, i.e., the n × n matrices whose entries are non-negative real numbers and whose rows and columns each add up to 1. It is named after Garrett Birkhoff.","image":"790ae0c7c68b1f1d792cc1d5985e1cbe0139d905.svg","url":"Birkhoff_polytope"}
