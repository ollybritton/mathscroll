{"title":"Graph homomorphism","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a graph homomorphism is a mapping between two graphs that respects their structure. More concretely, it is a function between the vertex sets of two graphs that maps adjacent vertices to adjacent vertices.","image":"Graph_homomorphism_into_C5.svg.png.webp","url":"Graph_homomorphism"}
