{"title":"Mathematics Made Difficult","summary":"Mathematics Made Difficult is a book by Carl E. Linderholm that uses advanced mathematical methods to prove results normally shown using elementary proofs.  Although the aim is largely satirical,[1][2] it also shows the non-trivial mathematics behind operations normally considered obvious, such as numbering, counting, and factoring integers. Linderholm discusses these seemingly-obvious ideas using concepts like categories and monoids.[3]","image":"Mathematics_Made_Difficult.jpg.webp","url":"Mathematics_Made_Difficult"}
