{"title":"Matching polytope","summary":"In graph theory, the matching polytope of a given graph is a geometric object representing the possible matchings in the graph. It is a convex polytope each of whose corners corresponds to a matching. It has great theoretical importance in the theory of matching.[1]: 273–285","image":"ff368561d6f6250ee981e536617e6fcc64243780.svg","url":"Matching_polytope"}
