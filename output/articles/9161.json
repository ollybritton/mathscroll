{"title":"Legendre transform (integral transform)","summary":"In mathematics, Legendre transform is an integral transform named after the mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre, which uses Legendre polynomials P n ( x ) {\\displaystyle P_{n}(x)} as kernels of the transform. Legendre transform is a special case of Jacobi transform.","image":"56b845e52aab1ff2164ab7ce026bf467823f32de.svg","url":"Legendre_transform_(integral_transform)"}
