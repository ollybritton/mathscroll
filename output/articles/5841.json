{"title":"Functor category","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a functor category D C {\\displaystyle D^{C}} is a category where the objects are the functors F : C → D {\\displaystyle F:C\\to D} and the morphisms are natural transformations η : F → G {\\displaystyle \\eta :F\\to G} between the functors (here, G : C → D {\\displaystyle G:C\\to D} is another object in the category). Functor categories are of interest for two main reasons:","image":"108456f7fa636edcc6227f68cd48cade449ab356.svg","url":"Functor_category"}
