{"title":"Gauss's law for gravity","summary":"In physics, Gauss's law for gravity, also known as Gauss's flux theorem for gravity, is a law of physics that is equivalent to Newton's law of universal gravitation. It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss. It states that the flux (surface integral) of the gravitational field over any closed surface is proportional to the mass enclosed.  Gauss's law for gravity is often more convenient to work from than Newton's law.[1]","image":"OiintLaTeX.svg.png.webp","url":"Gauss's_law_for_gravity"}
