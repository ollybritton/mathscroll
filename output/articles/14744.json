{"title":"Spectral method","summary":"Spectral methods are a class of techniques used in applied mathematics and scientific computing to numerically solve certain differential equations. The idea is to write the solution of the differential equation as a sum of certain \"basis functions\" (for example, as a Fourier series which is a sum of sinusoids) and then to choose the coefficients in the sum in order to satisfy the differential equation as well as possible.","image":"bf358a54b0375e22ae5f3ab2c3e1a22c0c87e11c.svg","url":"Spectral_method"}
