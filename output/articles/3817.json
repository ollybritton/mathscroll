{"title":"De Branges's theorem","summary":"In complex analysis, de Branges's theorem, or the Bieberbach conjecture, is a theorem that gives a necessary condition on a holomorphic function in order for it to map the open unit disk of the complex plane injectively to the complex plane. It was posed by Ludwig Bieberbach (1916) and finally proven by Louis de Branges (1985).","image":"790f9209748c2dca7ed7b81932c37c02af1dbc31.svg","url":"De_Branges's_theorem"}
