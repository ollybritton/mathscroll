{"title":"Kummer–Vandiver conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture, or Vandiver conjecture, states that a prime p does not divide the class number hK of  the maximal real subfield K = Q ( ζ p ) + {\\displaystyle K=\\mathbb {Q} (\\zeta _{p})^{+}} of the p-th cyclotomic field. The conjecture was first made by Ernst Kummer on 28 December 1849 and 24 April 1853 in  letters  to Leopold Kronecker, reprinted in (Kummer 1975, pages 84, 93, 123–124), and independently rediscovered around 1920 by Philipp Furtwängler and Harry Vandiver (1946, p. 576),","image":"c755c1a3a4100e8b6dc92864582763d523c23057.svg","url":"Kummer–Vandiver_conjecture"}
