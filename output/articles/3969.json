{"title":"Dependence logic","summary":"Dependence logic is a logical formalism, created by Jouko Väänänen,[1] which adds dependence atoms to the language of first-order logic. A dependence atom is an expression of the form = ( t 1 … t n ) {\\displaystyle =\\!\\!(t_{1}\\ldots t_{n})} , where t 1 … t n {\\displaystyle t_{1}\\ldots t_{n}} are terms, and corresponds to the statement that the value of t n {\\displaystyle t_{n}} is functionally dependent on the values of t 1 … t n − 1 {\\displaystyle t_{1}\\ldots t_{n-1}} .","image":"b93436ee2be6eac0931c66c4bd1e330721ec9727.svg","url":"Dependence_logic"}
