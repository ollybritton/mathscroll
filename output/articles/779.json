{"title":"Anderson–Kadec theorem","summary":"In mathematics, in the areas of topology and functional analysis, the Anderson–Kadec theorem states[1] that any two infinite-dimensional, separable Banach spaces, or, more generally, Fréchet spaces, are homeomorphic as topological spaces. The theorem was proved by Mikhail Kadets (1966) and Richard Davis Anderson.","image":"db67ba87d37ef413397521453e15417a988569db.svg","url":"Anderson–Kadec_theorem"}
