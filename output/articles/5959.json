{"title":"Garnier integrable system","summary":"In mathematical physics, the Garnier integrable system, also known as the classical Gaudin model is a classical mechanical system discovered by René Garnier in 1919 by taking the 'Painlevé simplification' or 'autonomous limit' of the Schlesinger equations.[1][2] It is a classical analogue to the quantum Gaudin model due to Michel Gaudin[3] (similarly, the Schlesinger equations are a classical analogue to the Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations). The classical Gaudin models are integrable.","image":"aaf4207e44c00a9312fe3e8710efbefcd6eafdc0.svg","url":"Garnier_integrable_system"}
