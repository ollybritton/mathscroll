{"title":"Numerical solution of the convection窶電iffusion equation","summary":"The convection窶電iffusion equation describes the flow of heat, particles, or other physical quantities in situations where there is both diffusion and convection or advection. For information about the equation, its derivation, and its conceptual importance and consequences, see the main article convection窶電iffusion equation. This article describes how to use a computer to calculate an approximate numerical solution of the discretized equation, in a time-dependent situation.","image":"7d5e59b71b566ee05d5c2dcec53f28625a66c1c2.svg","url":"Numerical_solution_of_the_convection窶電iffusion_equation"}
