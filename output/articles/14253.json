{"title":"Shape of a probability distribution","summary":"In statistics, the concept of the shape of a probability distribution arises in questions of finding an appropriate distribution to use to model the statistical properties of a population, given a sample from that population. The shape of a distribution may be considered either descriptively, using terms such as \"J-shaped\", or numerically, using quantitative measures such as skewness and kurtosis.","image":"Standard_deviation_diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Shape_of_a_probability_distribution"}
