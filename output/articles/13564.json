{"title":"Riemann–Stieltjes integral","summary":"In mathematics, the Riemann–Stieltjes integral is a generalization of the Riemann integral, named after Bernhard Riemann and Thomas Joannes Stieltjes. The definition of this integral was first published in 1894 by Stieltjes.[1] It serves as an instructive and useful precursor of the Lebesgue integral, and an invaluable tool in unifying equivalent forms of statistical theorems that apply to discrete and continuous probability.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Riemann–Stieltjes_integral"}
