{"title":"Free loop","summary":"In the mathematical field of topology, a free loop is a variant of the mathematical notion of a loop.  Whereas a loop has a distinguished point on it, called a basepoint, a free loop lacks such a distinguished point.  Formally, let X {\\displaystyle X} be a topological space.  Then a free loop in X {\\displaystyle X} is an equivalence class of continuous functions from the circle S 1 {\\displaystyle S^{1}} to X {\\displaystyle X} .  Two loops are equivalent if they differ by a reparameterization of the circle.  That is, f ∼ g {\\displaystyle f\\sim g} if there exists a homeomorphism ψ : S 1 → S 1 {\\displaystyle \\psi :S^{1}\\rightarrow S^{1}} such that g = f ∘ ψ {\\displaystyle g=f\\circ \\psi } .","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Free_loop"}
