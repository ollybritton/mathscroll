{"title":"Tautological one-form","summary":"In mathematics, the tautological one-form is a special 1-form defined on the cotangent bundle T âˆ— Q {\\displaystyle T^{*}Q} of a manifold Q . {\\displaystyle Q.} In physics, it is used to create a correspondence between the velocity of a point in a mechanical system and its momentum, thus providing a bridge between Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics (on the manifold Q {\\displaystyle Q} ).","image":"65fb00f6cdbeda1d54fd538e6671c8cd11c24097.svg","url":"Tautological_one-form"}
