{"title":"Combined linear congruential generator","summary":"A combined linear congruential generator (CLCG) is a pseudo-random number generator algorithm based on combining two or more linear congruential generators (LCG). A traditional LCG has a period which is inadequate for complex system simulation.[1] By combining two or more LCGs, random numbers with a longer period and better statistical properties can be created.[1] The algorithm is defined as:[2]","image":"b46ecfd047497aa015ff5026472ec93cb31f3adf.svg","url":"Combined_linear_congruential_generator"}
