{"title":"Arithmetico-geometric sequence","summary":"In mathematics, arithmetico-geometric sequence is the result of term-by-term multiplication of a geometric progression with the corresponding terms of an arithmetic progression. Put plainly, the nth term of an arithmetico-geometric sequence is the product of the nth term of an arithmetic sequence and the nth term of a geometric one.[1] Arithmetico-geometric sequences arise in various applications, such as the computation of expected values in probability theory. For instance, the sequence","image":"71335524ad4e069ff1883ab0a138051011280134.svg","url":"Arithmetico-geometric_sequence"}
