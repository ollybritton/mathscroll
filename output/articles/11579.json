{"title":"Orlicz sequence space","summary":"In mathematics, an Orlicz sequence space is any of certain class of linear spaces of scalar-valued sequences, endowed with a special norm, specified below, under which it forms a Banach space.  Orlicz sequence spaces generalize the â„“ p {\\displaystyle \\ell _{p}} spaces, and as such play an important role in functional analysis.","image":"8265d5df21cb4dab10dd3cd69a19895d649f5b45.svg","url":"Orlicz_sequence_space"}
