{"title":"Phragmén–Lindelöf principle","summary":"In complex analysis, the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle (or method), first formulated by Lars Edvard Phragmén (1863–1937) and Ernst Leonard Lindelöf (1870–1946) in 1908, is a technique which employs an auxiliary, parameterized function to prove the boundedness of a holomorphic function f {\\displaystyle f} (i.e, | f ( z ) | < M ( z ∈ Ω ) {\\displaystyle |f(z)|<M\\ \\ (z\\in \\Omega )} ) on an unbounded domain Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } when an additional (usually mild) condition constraining the growth of | f | {\\displaystyle |f|} on Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } is given.  It is a generalization of the maximum modulus principle, which is only applicable to bounded domains.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Phragmén–Lindelöf_principle"}
