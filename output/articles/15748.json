{"title":"Thomas–Yau conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, and especially symplectic geometry, the Thomas–Yau conjecture asks for the existence of a stability condition, similar to those which appear in algebraic geometry, which guarantees the existence of a solution to the special Lagrangian equation inside a Hamiltonian isotopy class of Lagrangian submanifolds. In particular the conjecture contains two difficulties: first it asks what a suitable stability condition might be, and secondly if one can prove stability of an isotopy class if and only if it contains a special Lagrangian representative.","image":"6f376be7f770bf3841c72b6e30e0c723a7ba51c0.svg","url":"Thomas–Yau_conjecture"}
