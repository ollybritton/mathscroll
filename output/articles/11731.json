{"title":"Pairwise summation","summary":"In numerical analysis, pairwise summation, also called cascade summation, is a technique to sum a sequence of finite-precision floating-point numbers that substantially reduces the accumulated round-off error compared to naively accumulating the sum in sequence.[1]  Although there are other techniques such as Kahan summation that typically have even smaller round-off errors, pairwise summation is nearly as good (differing only by a logarithmic factor) while having much lower computational costâ€”it can be implemented so as to have nearly the same cost (and exactly the same number of arithmetic operations) as naive summation.","image":"ff60d74db9ca960687dbeb5fc8cd5e7aba294b9d.svg","url":"Pairwise_summation"}
