{"title":"Junction tree algorithm","summary":"The junction tree algorithm (also known as 'Clique Tree')  is a method used in machine learning to extract marginalization in general graphs.  In essence, it entails performing belief propagation on a modified graph called a junction tree. The graph is called a tree because it branches into different sections of data; nodes of variables are the branches.[1] The basic premise is to eliminate cycles by clustering them into single nodes. Multiple extensive classes of queries can be compiled at the same time into larger structures of data.[1] There are different algorithms to meet specific needs and for what needs to be calculated. Inference algorithms gather new developments in the data and calculate it based on the new information provided.[2]","image":"Junction-tree-example.gif","url":"Junction_tree_algorithm"}
