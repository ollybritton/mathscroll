{"title":"Baik–Deift–Johansson theorem","summary":"The Baik–Deift–Johansson theorem is a result from combinatorics. It deals with the subsequences of a randomly uniformly drawn permutation from the set { 1 , 2 , … , N } {\\displaystyle \\{1,2,\\dots ,N\\}} . The theorem makes a statement about the distribution of the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the limit. The theorem was influential in probability theory since it connected the KPZ-universality with the theory of random matrices.","image":"6811aa85f470f4998978e166e045b439658b8a1f.svg","url":"Baik–Deift–Johansson_theorem"}
