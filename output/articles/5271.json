{"title":"Fagin's theorem","summary":"Fagin's theorem is the oldest result of descriptive complexity theory, a branch of computational complexity theory that characterizes complexity classes in terms of logic-based descriptions of their problems rather than by the behavior of algorithms for solving those problems. The theorem states that the set of all properties expressible in existential second-order logic is precisely the complexity class NP.","image":"53af70c07e0932d85d2fdb70c56360544c3a0b5a.svg","url":"Fagin's_theorem"}
