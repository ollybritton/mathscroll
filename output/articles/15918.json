{"title":"Totally bounded space","summary":"In topology and related branches of mathematics, total-boundedness is a generalization of compactness for circumstances in which a set is not necessarily closed.  A totally bounded set can be covered by finitely many subsets of every fixed “size” (where the meaning of “size” depends on the structure of the ambient space).","image":"Unit_square_totally_bounded_space.png.webp","url":"Totally_bounded_space"}
