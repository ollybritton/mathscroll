{"title":"Lighthouse paradox","summary":"The lighthouse paradox is a thought experiment in which the speed of light is apparently exceeded.  The rotating beam of light from a lighthouse is imagined to be swept from one object to shine on a second object.  The farther the two objects are away from the lighthouse, the farther the distance between them crossed by the light beam.  If the objects are sufficiently far away from the lighthouse, the places where the beam hits object 2 will traverse the object with an apparent speed faster than light, possibly communicating a signal on object 2 with superluminal velocity, which violates Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity.","image":"Lighthouse_paradox_diagram.png.webp","url":"Lighthouse_paradox"}
