{"title":"AKS primality test","summary":"The AKS primality test (also known as Agrawal–Kayal–Saxena primality test and cyclotomic AKS test) is a deterministic primality-proving algorithm created and published by Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena, computer scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, on August 6, 2002, in an article titled \"PRIMES is in P\".[1] The algorithm was the first one which is able to determine in polynomial time, whether a given number is prime or composite and this without relying on mathematical conjectures such as the generalized Riemann hypothesis. The proof is also notable for not relying on the field of analysis.[2] In 2006 the authors received both the Gödel Prize and Fulkerson Prize for their work.","image":"e6bf67f9d06ca3af619657f8d20ee1322da77174.svg","url":"AKS_primality_test"}
