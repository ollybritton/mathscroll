{"title":"Maximal function","summary":"Maximal functions appear in many forms in harmonic analysis (an area of mathematics). One of the most important of these is the Hardyâ€“Littlewood maximal function. They play an important role in understanding, for example, the differentiability properties of functions, singular integrals and partial differential equations. They often provide a deeper and more simplified approach to understanding problems in these areas than other methods.","image":"35b9c87f7279e7f49f1089a5d065ff0eec057581.svg","url":"Maximal_function"}
