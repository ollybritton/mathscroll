{"title":"Large deviations theory","summary":"In probability theory, the theory of large deviations concerns the asymptotic behaviour of remote tails of sequences of probability distributions. While some basic ideas of the theory can be traced to Laplace, the formalization started with insurance mathematics, namely ruin theory with Cram√©r and Lundberg. A unified formalization of large deviation theory was developed in 1966, in a paper by Varadhan.[1] Large deviations theory formalizes the heuristic ideas of concentration of measures and widely generalizes the notion of convergence of probability measures.","image":"af4a0955af42beb5f85aa05fb8c07abedc13990d.svg","url":"Large_deviations_theory"}
