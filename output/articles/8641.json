{"title":"Keith number","summary":"In recreational mathematics, a Keith number or repfigit number (short for repetitive Fibonacci-like digit) is a natural number n {\\displaystyle n} in a given number base b {\\displaystyle b} with k {\\displaystyle k} digits such that when a sequence is created such that the first k {\\displaystyle k} terms are the k {\\displaystyle k} digits of n {\\displaystyle n} and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous k {\\displaystyle k} terms, n {\\displaystyle n} is part of the sequence. Keith numbers were introduced by Mike Keith in 1987.[1] They are computationally very challenging to find, with only about 100 known.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Keith_number"}
