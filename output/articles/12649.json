{"title":"Proof theory","summary":"Proof theory is a major branch[1] of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques.  Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system.  Consequently, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.","image":"b0b3c0e79d8a5db977a9838be477eb3e30348937.svg","url":"Proof_theory"}
