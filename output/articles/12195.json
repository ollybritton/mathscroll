{"title":"Planar separator theorem","summary":"In graph theory, the planar separator theorem is a form of isoperimetric inequality for planar graphs, that states that any planar graph can be split into smaller pieces by removing a small number of vertices. Specifically, the removal of O ( n ) {\\displaystyle O({\\sqrt {n}})} vertices from an n-vertex graph (where the O invokes big O notation) can partition the graph into disjoint subgraphs each of which has at most 2 n / 3 {\\displaystyle 2n/3} vertices.","image":"f5526ab1252c0f682bbe07c0ad67c0f29de5522b.svg","url":"Planar_separator_theorem"}
