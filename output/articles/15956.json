{"title":"Transfer (group theory)","summary":"In the mathematical field of group theory, the transfer defines, given a group G and a subgroup of finite index H, a group homomorphism from G to the abelianization of H. It can be used in conjunction with the Sylow theorems to obtain certain numerical results on the existence of finite simple groups.","image":"3f4189a3c4c1e7df3afc3cb3dbca2103f8fca559.svg","url":"Transfer_(group_theory)"}
