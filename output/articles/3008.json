{"title":"Complex conjugate root theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the complex conjugate root theorem states that if P is a polynomial in one variable with real coefficients, and a + bi is a root of P with a and b real numbers, then its complex conjugate a − bi is also a root of P.[1]","image":"71f8908cd7def5cd1e2305f2f227cde121b30367.svg","url":"Complex_conjugate_root_theorem"}
