{"title":"Scaling (geometry)","summary":"In affine geometry, uniform scaling (or isotropic scaling[1]) is a linear transformation that enlarges (increases) or shrinks (diminishes) objects by a scale factor that is the same in all directions. The result of uniform scaling is similar (in the geometric sense) to the original.  A scale factor of 1 is normally allowed, so that congruent shapes are also classed as similar.  Uniform scaling happens, for example, when enlarging or reducing a photograph, or when creating a scale model of a building, car, airplane, etc.","image":"Sierpinski_triangle_evolution.svg.png.webp","url":"Scaling_(geometry)"}
