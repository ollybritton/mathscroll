{"title":"Cocoloring","summary":"In graph theory, a cocoloring of a graph G is an assignment of colors to the vertices such that each color class forms an independent set in G or in the complement of G. The cochromatic number z(G) of G is the fewest colors needed in any cocolorings of G. The graphs with cochromatic number 2 are exactly the bipartite graphs, complements of bipartite graphs, and split graphs.","image":"Cocoloring.svg.png.webp","url":"Cocoloring"}
