{"title":"Algebraic structure","summary":"In mathematics, an algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set A (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on A (typically binary operations such as addition and multiplication), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.","image":"8e9972f426d9e07855984f73ee195a21dbc21755.svg","url":"Algebraic_structure"}
