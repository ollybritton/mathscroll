{"title":"Kleisli category","summary":"In category theory, a Kleisli category is a category naturally associated to any monad T. It is equivalent to the category of free T-algebras. The Kleisli category is one of two extremal solutions to the question Does every monad arise from an adjunction? The other extremal solution is the Eilenbergâ€“Moore category. Kleisli categories are named for the mathematician Heinrich Kleisli.","image":"45e2cb20afd5db3fc7544bd06a39f0543284a35f.svg","url":"Kleisli_category"}
