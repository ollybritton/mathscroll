{"title":"Square root","summary":"In mathematics, a square root of a number x is a number y such that y2 = x; in other words, a number y whose square (the result of multiplying the number by itself, or y ⋅ y) is x.[1] For example, 4 and −4 are square roots of 16, because 42 = (−4)2 = 16.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Square_root"}
