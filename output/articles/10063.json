{"title":"Mathematical beauty","summary":"Mathematical beauty is the aesthetic pleasure derived from the abstractness, purity, simplicity, depth or orderliness of mathematics. Mathematicians may express this pleasure by describing mathematics (or, at least, some aspect of mathematics) as beautiful or describe mathematics as an art form, (a position taken by G. H. Hardy[1]) or, at a minimum, as a creative activity. Comparisons are  made with music and poetry.","image":"Pythagorean_proof_(1).svg.png.webp","url":"Mathematical_beauty"}
