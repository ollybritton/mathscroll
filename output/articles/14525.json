{"title":"Slowly varying function","summary":"In real analysis, a branch of mathematics, a slowly varying function is a function of a real variable whose behaviour at infinity is in some sense similar to the behaviour of a function converging at infinity. Similarly, a regularly varying function is a function of a real variable whose behaviour at infinity is similar to the behaviour of a power law function (like a polynomial) near infinity. These classes of functions were both introduced by Jovan Karamata,[1][2] and have found several important applications, for example in probability theory.","image":"a0a4e39c947dbaf8b5b9e30175e0ce50325ed913.svg","url":"Slowly_varying_function"}
