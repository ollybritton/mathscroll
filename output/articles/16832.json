{"title":"Weitzenböck identity","summary":"In mathematics, in particular in differential geometry, mathematical physics, and representation theory a Weitzenböck identity, named after Roland Weitzenböck, expresses a relationship between two second-order elliptic operators on a manifold with the same principal symbol. Usually Weitzenböck formulae are implemented for G-invariant self-adjoint operators between vector bundles associated to some principal G-bundle, although the precise conditions under which such a formula exists are difficult to formulate.  This article focuses on three examples of Weitzenböck identities:  from Riemannian geometry, spin geometry, and complex analysis.","image":"67460d523d9ed8948484871c57bdec8ac24da716.svg","url":"Weitzenböck_identity"}
