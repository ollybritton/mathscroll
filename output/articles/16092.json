{"title":"Triplet loss","summary":"Triplet loss is a loss function for machine learning algorithms where a reference input (called anchor) is compared to a matching input (called positive) and a non-matching input (called negative). The distance from the anchor to the positive is minimized, and the distance from the anchor to the negative input is maximized.[1][2] An early formulation equivalent to triplet loss was introduced (without the idea of using anchors) for metric learning from relative comparisons by M. Schultze and T. Joachims in 2003.[3]","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg","url":"Triplet_loss"}
