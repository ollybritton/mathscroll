{"title":"Backward Euler method","summary":"In numerical analysis and scientific computing, the backward Euler method (or implicit Euler method) is one of the most basic numerical methods for the solution of ordinary differential equations. It is similar to the (standard) Euler method, but differs in that it is an implicit method. The backward Euler method has error of order one in time.","image":"5e472078c4b129b89415c617fd0c9442ac61a51d.svg","url":"Backward_Euler_method"}
