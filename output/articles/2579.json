{"title":"Chiral algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a chiral algebra is an algebraic structure introduced by Beilinson & Drinfeld (2004) as a rigorous version of the rather vague concept of a chiral algebra in physics. In Chiral Algebras, Beilinson and Drinfeld introduced the notion of chiral algebra, which based on the pseudo-tensor category of D-modules. They give an 'coordinate independent' notion of vertex algebras, which are based on formal power series. Chiral algebras on curves are essentially conformal vertex algebras.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Chiral_algebra"}
