{"title":"Assouad dimension","summary":"In mathematics — specifically, in fractal geometry — the Assouad dimension is a definition of fractal dimension for subsets of a metric space.  It was introduced by Patrice Assouad in his 1977 PhD thesis and later published in 1979,[1] although the same notion had been studied in 1928 by Georges Bouligand.[2]  As well as being used to study fractals, the Assouad dimension has also been used to study quasiconformal mappings and embeddability problems.","image":"Assouad_dimension.svg.png.webp","url":"Assouad_dimension"}
