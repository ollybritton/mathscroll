{"title":"Kumaraswamy distribution","summary":"In probability and statistics, the Kumaraswamy's double bounded distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions defined on the interval (0,1). It is similar to the Beta distribution, but much simpler to use especially in simulation studies since its probability density function, cumulative distribution function and quantile functions can be expressed in closed form. This distribution was originally proposed by Poondi Kumaraswamy[1] for variables that are lower and upper bounded with a zero-inflation. This was extended to inflations at both extremes [0,1] in later work with S. G . Fletcher.[2]","image":"KumaraswamyT_pdf.svg.png.webp","url":"Kumaraswamy_distribution"}
