{"title":"Leopoldt's conjecture","summary":"In algebraic number theory, Leopoldt's conjecture, introduced by  H.-W. Leopoldt (1962, 1975), states that the p-adic regulator of a number field does not vanish. The p-adic regulator is an analogue of the usual regulator defined using p-adic logarithms instead of the usual logarithms, introduced by H.-W. Leopoldt (1962).","image":"10626b66872e14b6214bdeed54879822d6f30ef4.svg","url":"Leopoldt's_conjecture"}
