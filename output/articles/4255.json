{"title":"Discrete group","summary":"In mathematics, a topological group G is called a discrete group if there is no limit point in it (i.e., for each element in G, there is a neighborhood which only contains that element). Equivalently, the group G is discrete if and only if its identity is isolated.[1]","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Discrete_group"}
