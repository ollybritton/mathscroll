{"title":"Trigonometry","summary":"Trigonometry (from Ancient Greek  τρίγωνον (trígōnon) 'triangle', and  μέτρον (métron) 'measure')[1] is a branch of mathematics concerned with relationships between  angles and ratios of lengths. The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies.[2] The Greeks focused on the calculation of chords, while mathematicians in India created the earliest-known tables of values for trigonometric ratios (also called trigonometric functions) such as sine.[3]","image":"Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_1.svg.png.webp","url":"Trigonometry"}
