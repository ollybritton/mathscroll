{"title":"Alignments of random points","summary":"Alignments of random points in a plane refers to the study of the relative positions of point that are randomly placed in a planar region. For example, how closely can we expect to find three points lying on a straight line? Studies have shown that such near-alignments occur by chance with greater frequency than one might intuitively expect.  This has been put forward as a demonstration that ley lines and other similar mysterious alignments believed by some to be phenomena of deep significance might exist solely due to chance alone, as opposed to the supernatural or anthropological explanations put forward by their proponents. The topic has also been studied in the fields of computer vision and astronomy.","image":"Ley_lines.svg.png.webp","url":"Alignments_of_random_points"}
