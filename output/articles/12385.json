{"title":"Porism","summary":"A porism is a mathematical proposition or corollary. It has been used to refer to a direct consequence of a proof, analogous to how a corollary refers to a direct consequence of a theorem. In modern usage, it is a relationship that holds for an infinite range of values but only if a certain condition is assumed, such as Steiner's porism.[1] The term originates from three books of Euclid that have been lost. A proposition may not have been proven, so a porism may not be a theorem or true.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Porism"}
