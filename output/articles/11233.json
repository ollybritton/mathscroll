{"title":"Normal scheme","summary":"In algebraic geometry, an algebraic variety or scheme X  is normal if it is normal at every point, meaning that the local ring at the point is an integrally closed domain. An affine variety X (understood to be irreducible) is normal if and only if the ring O(X) of regular functions on X is an integrally closed domain. A variety X over a field is normal if and only if every finite birational morphism from any variety Y to X is an isomorphism.","image":"Newtonsche_Knoten.png.webp","url":"Normal_scheme"}
