{"title":"Convex polytope","summary":"A convex polytope is a special case of a polytope, having the additional property that it is also a convex set contained in the n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} . Most texts[1][2] use the term \"polytope\" for a bounded convex polytope, and the word \"polyhedron\" for the more general, possibly unbounded object. Others[3] (including this article) allow polytopes to be unbounded. The terms \"bounded/unbounded convex polytope\" will be used below whenever the boundedness is critical to the discussed issue. Yet other texts identify a convex polytope with its boundary.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Convex_polytope"}
