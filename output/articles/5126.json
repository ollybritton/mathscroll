{"title":"Exact trigonometric values","summary":"In mathematics, the values of the trigonometric functions can be expressed approximately, as in cos ⁡ ( π / 4 ) ≈ 0.707 {\\displaystyle \\cos(\\pi /4)\\approx 0.707} , or exactly, as in cos ⁡ ( π / 4 ) = 2 / 2 {\\displaystyle \\cos(\\pi /4)={\\sqrt {2}}/2} .  While trigonometric tables contain many approximate values, the exact values for certain angles can be expressed by a combination of arithmetic operations and square roots.","image":"c5fe6ad5cf786574fd0761965c0bdaf5f01e3c94.svg","url":"Exact_trigonometric_values"}
