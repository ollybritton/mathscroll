{"title":"Coplanarity","summary":"In geometry, a set of points in space are coplanar if there exists a geometric plane that contains them all. For example, three points are always coplanar, and if the points are distinct and non-collinear, the plane they determine is unique. However, a set of four or more distinct points will, in general, not lie in a single plane.","image":"40301d3d515637e356b2c4bbc59752c0af16aed8.svg","url":"Coplanarity"}
