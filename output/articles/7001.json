{"title":"Heinrich Martin Weber","summary":"Heinrich Martin Weber (5 March 1842, Heidelberg, Germany – 17 May 1913, Straßburg, Alsace-Lorraine, German Empire, now Strasbourg, France) was a German mathematician.[1] Weber's main work was in algebra, number theory, and analysis. He is best known for his text Lehrbuch der Algebra published in 1895 and much of it is his original research in algebra and number theory. His work Theorie der algebraischen Functionen einer Veränderlichen (with Dedekind) established an algebraic foundation for Riemann surfaces, allowing a purely algebraic formulation of the Riemann–Roch theorem. Weber's research papers were numerous, most of them appearing in Crelle's Journal or Mathematische Annalen. He was the editor of Riemann's collected works.","image":"ETH-BIB-Weber%2C_Heinrich_(1842-1913)-Portrait-Portr_09008.tif_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Heinrich_Martin_Weber"}
