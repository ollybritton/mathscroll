{"title":"Rogers polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the Rogers polynomials, also called Rogers–Askey–Ismail polynomials and continuous q-ultraspherical polynomials, are a family of orthogonal polynomials introduced by Rogers (1892, 1893, 1894) in the course of his work on the Rogers–Ramanujan identities. They are q-analogs of ultraspherical polynomials, and are the Macdonald polynomials for the special case of the A1 affine root system (Macdonald 2003, p.156).","image":"faece49ebe10eed580a97409cd26aef217db4d76.svg","url":"Rogers_polynomials"}
