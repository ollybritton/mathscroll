{"title":"Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem","summary":"In algebraic number theory, the Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem states that a central simple algebra over an algebraic number field K which splits over every completion Kv is a matrix algebra over K. The theorem is an example of a local-global principle in algebraic number theory and leads to a complete description of finite-dimensional division algebras over algebraic number fields in terms of their local invariants. It was proved independently by Richard Brauer, Helmut Hasse, and Emmy Noether and by Abraham Adrian Albert.","image":"7b8c6072af85999a688327d6a2f3ef1b3688a5d8.svg","url":"Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether_theorem"}
