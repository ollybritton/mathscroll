{"title":"Hemicompact space","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of topology, a topological space is said to be hemicompact if it has a sequence of compact subsets such that every compact subset of the space lies inside some compact set in the sequence.[1] Clearly, this forces the union of the sequence to be the whole space, because every point is compact and hence must lie in one of the compact sets.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Hemicompact_space"}
