{"title":"Generalized dihedral group","summary":"In mathematics, the generalized dihedral groups are a family of groups with algebraic structures similar to that of the dihedral groups.  They include the finite dihedral groups, the infinite dihedral group, and the orthogonal group O(2). Dihedral groups play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.","image":"ae3755fa475f5eff85c9454364f650ef4a65402a.svg","url":"Generalized_dihedral_group"}
