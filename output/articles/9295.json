{"title":"Likelihood-ratio test","summary":"In statistics, the likelihood-ratio test assesses the goodness of fit of two competing statistical models based on the ratio of their likelihoods, specifically one found by maximization over the entire parameter space and another found after imposing some constraint. If the constraint (i.e., the null hypothesis) is supported by the observed data, the two likelihoods should not differ by more than sampling error.[1] Thus the likelihood-ratio test tests whether this ratio is significantly different from one, or equivalently whether its natural logarithm is significantly different from zero.","image":"bc927b19f46d005b4720db7a0f96cd5b6f1a0d9b.svg","url":"Likelihood-ratio_test"}
