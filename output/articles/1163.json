{"title":"Automorphic factor","summary":"In mathematics, an automorphic factor is a certain type of analytic function,  defined on subgroups of SL(2,R), appearing in the theory of modular forms. The general case, for general groups, is reviewed in the article 'factor of automorphy'.","image":"24f8871e7832c87b8cc102671721e7cc27622e23.svg","url":"Automorphic_factor"}
