{"title":"Geometric–harmonic mean","summary":"In mathematics, the geometric–harmonic mean M(x, y) of two positive real numbers x and y is defined as follows: we form the geometric mean of g0 = x and h0 = y and call it g1, i.e. g1 is the square root of xy.  We also form the harmonic mean of x and y and call it h1, i.e. h1 is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of x and y.  These may be done sequentially (in any order) or simultaneously.","image":"244ea9dc8a5736db41af781c20a5b706f7b4ceb4.svg","url":"Geometric–harmonic_mean"}
