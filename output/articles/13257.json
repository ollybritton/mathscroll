{"title":"Reduction (complexity)","summary":"In computability theory and computational complexity theory, a reduction is an algorithm for transforming one problem into another problem. A sufficiently efficient reduction from one problem to another may be used to show that the second problem is at least as difficult as the first.","image":"3SAT_reduced_too_VC.svg.png.webp","url":"Reduction_(complexity)"}
