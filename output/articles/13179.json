{"title":"Real computation","summary":"In computability theory, the theory of real computation deals with hypothetical computing machines using infinite-precision real numbers. They are given this name because they operate on the set of real numbers. Within this theory, it is possible to prove interesting statements such as \"The complement of the Mandelbrot set is only partially decidable.\"","image":"Operational_amplifier_integrator.svg.png.webp","url":"Real_computation"}
