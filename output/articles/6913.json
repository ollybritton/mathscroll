{"title":"Harmonious set","summary":"In mathematics, a harmonious set is a subset of a locally compact abelian group on which every weak character may be uniformly approximated by strong characters. Equivalently, a suitably defined dual set is relatively dense in the Pontryagin dual of the group. This notion was introduced by Yves Meyer in 1970 and later turned out to play an important role in the mathematical theory of quasicrystals. Some related concepts are model sets, Meyer sets, and cut-and-project sets.","image":"a582bf14f3ec90e25e8287a0d2687fc5a1b5fd67.svg","url":"Harmonious_set"}
