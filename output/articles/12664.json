{"title":"Proper orthogonal decomposition","summary":"The proper orthogonal decomposition is a numerical method that enables a reduction in the complexity of computer intensive simulations such as computational fluid dynamics and structural analysis (like crash simulations). Typically in fluid dynamics and turbulences analysis, it is used to replace the Navierâ€“Stokes equations by simpler models to solve.[1]","image":"Kernel_Machine.svg.png.webp","url":"Proper_orthogonal_decomposition"}
