{"title":"Sicherman dice","summary":"Sicherman dice /ˈsɪkərmən/ are a pair of 6-sided dice with non-standard numbers–one with the sides 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4 and the other with the sides 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. They are notable as the  only pair of 6-sided dice that are not normal dice, bear only positive integers, and have the same probability distribution for the sum as normal dice.  They were invented in 1978 by George Sicherman of Buffalo, New York.","image":"Sicherman_dice_table.svg.png.webp","url":"Sicherman_dice"}
