{"title":"Root of unity modulo n","summary":"In number theory, a kth root of unity modulo n for positive integers k, n ≥ 2,  is a root of unity in the ring of integers modulo n; that is, a solution x to the equation (or congruence) x k ≡ 1 ( mod n ) {\\displaystyle x^{k}\\equiv 1{\\pmod {n}}} .  If k is the smallest such exponent for x, then x is called a primitive kth root of unity modulo n.[1] See modular arithmetic for notation and terminology.","image":"15933d9ca69b408c6e958c04a64e71b5a0ac1435.svg","url":"Root_of_unity_modulo_n"}
