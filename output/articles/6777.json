{"title":"Hadamard manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a Hadamard manifold, named after Jacques Hadamard — more often called a Cartan–Hadamard manifold, after Élie Cartan — is a Riemannian manifold ( M , g ) {\\displaystyle (M,g)} that is complete and simply connected and has everywhere non-positive sectional curvature.[1][2] By Cartan–Hadamard theorem all Cartan–Hadamard manifolds are diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space R n . {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}.} Furthermore it follows from the Hopf–Rinow theorem that every pairs of points in a Cartan–Hadamard manifold may be connected by a unique geodesic segment. Thus Cartan–Hadamard manifolds are some of the closest relatives of R n . {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}.}","image":"68e27d2e539fd0c3a9a7efab6257abd17de7fc57.svg","url":"Hadamard_manifold"}
