{"title":"Special linear Lie algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the special linear Lie algebra of order n (denoted s l n ( F ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {sl}}_{n}(F)} or s l ( n , F ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {sl}}(n,F)} ) is the Lie algebra of n × n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} matrices with trace zero and with the Lie bracket [ X , Y ] := X Y − Y X {\\displaystyle [X,Y]:=XY-YX} . This algebra is well studied and understood, and is often used as a model for the study of other Lie algebras.  The Lie group that it generates is the special linear group.","image":"8cfd7214c92d5aebdf17817a5da4456104dc1ad0.svg","url":"Special_linear_Lie_algebra"}
