{"title":"Z-test","summary":"A Z-test is any statistical test for which the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis can be approximated by a normal distribution. Z-tests test the mean of a distribution. For each significance level in the confidence interval, the Z-test has a single critical value (for example, 1.96 for 5% two tailed) which makes it more convenient than the Student's t-test whose critical values are defined by the sample size (through the corresponding degrees of freedom). Both the Z-test and Student's t-test have similarities in that they both help determine the significance of a set of data. However, the z-test is rarely used in practice because the population deviation is difficult to determine.","image":"Null-hypothesis-region-eng.png.webp","url":"Z-test"}
