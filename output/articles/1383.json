{"title":"Baumslag–Solitar group","summary":"In the mathematical field of group theory, the Baumslag–Solitar groups are examples of two-generator one-relator groups that play an important role in combinatorial group theory and geometric group theory as (counter)examples and test-cases.  They are given by the group presentation","image":"fe20fe72bc1dd83758c719f3b845611b887ecee3.svg","url":"Baumslag–Solitar_group"}
