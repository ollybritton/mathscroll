{"title":"Mathematics of the Incas","summary":"The mathematics of the Incas (or of the Tawantinsuyu) refer to the set of numerical and geometric knowledge and instruments developed and used in the nation of the Incas before the arrival of the Spaniards. It can be mainly characterized by its usefulness in the economic field. The quipus and yupanas are proof of the importance of arithmetic in Inca state administration. This was embodied in a simple but effective arithmetic, for accounting purposes, based on the decimal numeral system; they knew the zero,[1] and mastered addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The mathematics of the Incas had an eminently applicative character to tasks of management, statistics, and measurement that was far from the Euclidean outline of mathematics as a deductive corpus, since it was suitable and useful for the needs of a centralized administration.[note 1]","image":"Nueva_cor√≥nica_y_buen_gobierno_(1936_facsimile)_p360.png.webp","url":"Mathematics_of_the_Incas"}
