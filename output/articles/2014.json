{"title":"Brownian web","summary":"In probability theory, the Brownian web is an uncountable collection of one-dimensional coalescing Brownian motions, starting from every point in space and time. It arises as the diffusive space-time scaling limit of a collection of coalescing random walks, with one walk starting from each point of the integer lattice Z at each time.","image":"Voter_model_graphical_construction.png.webp","url":"Brownian_web"}
