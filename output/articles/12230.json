{"title":"Plücker formula","summary":"In mathematics, a Plücker formula, named after Julius Plücker, is one of a family of formulae, of a type first developed  by Plücker in the 1830s, that relate certain numeric invariants of algebraic curves to corresponding invariants of their dual curves. The invariant called the genus, common to both the curve and its dual, is connected to the other invariants by similar formulae. These formulae, and the fact that each of the invariants must be a positive integer, place quite strict limitations on their possible values.","image":"767ae95e00c3823a52722101e275bf572c898aaf.svg","url":"Plücker_formula"}
