{"title":"Ice-type model","summary":"In statistical mechanics, the ice-type models or six-vertex models are a family of vertex models for crystal lattices with hydrogen bonds. The first such model was introduced by Linus Pauling in 1935 to account for the residual entropy of water ice.[1] Variants have been proposed as models of certain ferroelectric[2] and antiferroelectric[3] crystals.","image":"Sixvertex2.png.webp","url":"Ice-type_model"}
