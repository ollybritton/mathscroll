{"title":"Mabuchi functional","summary":"In mathematics, and especially complex geometry, the Mabuchi functional or K-energy functional is a functional on the space of Kähler potentials of a compact Kähler manifold whose critical points are constant scalar curvature Kähler metrics. The Mabuchi functional was introduced by Toshiki Mabuchi in 1985 as a functional which integrates the Futaki invariant, which is an obstruction to the existence of a Kähler–Einstein metric on a Fano manifold.[1]","image":"d343da33a65bc6b0682b8da9ba31e5af966ce9eb.svg","url":"Mabuchi_functional"}
