{"title":"Epigraph (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, the epigraph or supergraph[1] of a function f : X → [ − ∞ , ∞ ] {\\displaystyle f:X\\to [-\\infty ,\\infty ]} valued in the extended real numbers [ − ∞ , ∞ ] = R ∪ { ± ∞ } {\\displaystyle [-\\infty ,\\infty ]=\\mathbb {R} \\cup \\{\\pm \\infty \\}} is the set, denoted by epi ⁡ f , {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {epi} f,} of all points in the Cartesian product X × R {\\displaystyle X\\times \\mathbb {R} } lying on or above its graph.[2] The strict epigraph epi S ⁡ f {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {epi} _{S}f} is the set of points in X × R {\\displaystyle X\\times \\mathbb {R} } lying strictly above its graph.","image":"cb5b80b60f448c0542dc59fd71f22b8ce01e8bc7.svg","url":"Epigraph_(mathematics)"}
