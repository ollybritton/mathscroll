{"title":"Weak coloring","summary":"In graph theory, a weak coloring is a special case of a graph labeling. A weak k-coloring of a graph G = (V, E) assigns a color c(v) ∈ {1, 2, ..., k} to each vertex v ∈ V, such that each non-isolated vertex  is adjacent to at least one vertex with different color. In notation, for each non-isolated v ∈ V, there is a vertex u ∈ V with {u, v} ∈ E and c(u) ≠ c(v).","image":"Weak-2-coloring.svg.png.webp","url":"Weak_coloring"}
