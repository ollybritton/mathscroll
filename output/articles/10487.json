{"title":"Minimal polynomial (field theory)","summary":"In field theory, a branch of mathematics, the minimal polynomial of an element α of a field extension is, roughly speaking, the polynomial of lowest degree having coefficients in the field, such that α is a root of the polynomial. If the minimal polynomial of α exists, it is unique. The coefficient of the highest-degree term in the polynomial is required to be 1.","image":"d0381945929156997b99bb43e5b7067d18c9a84b.svg","url":"Minimal_polynomial_(field_theory)"}
