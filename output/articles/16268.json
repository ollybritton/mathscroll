{"title":"Two-element Boolean algebra","summary":"In mathematics and abstract algebra, the two-element Boolean algebra is the Boolean algebra whose underlying set (or universe or carrier) B is the Boolean domain. The elements of the Boolean domain are 1 and 0 by convention, so that B = {0, 1}. Paul Halmos's name for this algebra \"2\" has some following in the literature, and will be employed here.","image":"e8dffd13997f052723628a9f285400ba83ba706b.svg","url":"Two-element_Boolean_algebra"}
