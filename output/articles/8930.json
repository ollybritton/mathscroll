{"title":"LASCNN algorithm","summary":"In graph theory, LASCNN is a Localized Algorithm for Segregation of Critical/Non-critical Nodes[1] The algorithm works on the principle of distinguishing between critical and non-critical nodes for network connectivity based on limited topology information.[2] The algorithm finds the critical nodes with partial information within a few hops.[3]","image":"Critical_Nodes_Application.png.webp","url":"LASCNN_algorithm"}
