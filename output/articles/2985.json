{"title":"Complete spatial randomness","summary":"Complete spatial randomness (CSR) describes a point process whereby point events occur within a given study area in a completely random fashion. It is synonymous with a homogeneous spatial Poisson process.[1] Such a process is modeled using only one parameter œÅ {\\displaystyle \\rho } , i.e. the density of points within the defined area. The term complete spatial randomness is commonly used in Applied Statistics in the context of examining certain point patterns, whereas in most other statistical contexts it is referred to the concept of a spatial Poisson process.[1]","image":"1f7d439671d1289b6a816e6af7a304be40608d64.svg","url":"Complete_spatial_randomness"}
