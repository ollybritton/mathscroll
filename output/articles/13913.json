{"title":"Sawtooth wave","summary":"The sawtooth wave (or saw wave) is a kind of non-sinusoidal waveform. It is so named based on its resemblance to the teeth of a plain-toothed saw with a zero rake angle.  A single sawtooth, or an intermittently triggered sawtooth, is called a ramp waveform.","image":"Sawtooth-td_and_fd.png.webp","url":"Sawtooth_wave"}
