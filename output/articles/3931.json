{"title":"Delta-functor","summary":"In homological algebra, a δ-functor between two abelian categories A and B is a collection of functors from A to B together with a collection of morphisms that satisfy properties generalising those of derived functors. A universal δ-functor is a δ-functor satisfying a specific universal property related to extending morphisms beyond \"degree 0\". These notions were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck in his \"Tohoku paper\" to provide an appropriate setting for derived functors.[1] In particular, derived functors are universal δ-functors.","image":"df38f7bbd1d549e2bab1170c963efa58dd654813.svg","url":"Delta-functor"}
