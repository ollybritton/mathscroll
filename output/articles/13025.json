{"title":"Radial set","summary":"In mathematics, a subset A ⊆ X {\\displaystyle A\\subseteq X} of a linear space X {\\displaystyle X} is radial at a given point a 0 ∈ A {\\displaystyle a_{0}\\in A} if for every x ∈ X {\\displaystyle x\\in X} there exists a real t x > 0 {\\displaystyle t_{x}>0} such that for every t ∈ [ 0 , t x ] , {\\displaystyle t\\in [0,t_{x}],} a 0 + t x ∈ A . {\\displaystyle a_{0}+tx\\in A.} [1] Geometrically, this means A {\\displaystyle A} is radial at a 0 {\\displaystyle a_{0}} if for every x ∈ X , {\\displaystyle x\\in X,} there is some (non-degenerate) line segment (depend on x {\\displaystyle x} ) emanating from a 0 {\\displaystyle a_{0}} in the direction of x {\\displaystyle x} that lies entirely in A . {\\displaystyle A.}","image":"1dce86da0107830a9a97287f9486d9b4ff022875.svg","url":"Radial_set"}
