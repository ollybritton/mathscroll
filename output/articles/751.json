{"title":"Analytic space","summary":"An analytic space is a generalization of an analytic manifold that allows singularities.  An analytic space is a space that is locally the same as an analytic variety.  They are prominent in the study of several complex variables, but they also appear in other contexts.","image":"c9a9cef2217740befda1b31bb9a65ec7cb8a1d8e.svg","url":"Analytic_space"}
