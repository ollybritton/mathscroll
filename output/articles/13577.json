{"title":"Rigged Hilbert space","summary":"In mathematics, a rigged Hilbert space (Gelfand triple, nested Hilbert space, equipped Hilbert space) is a construction designed to link the distribution and square-integrable aspects of functional analysis. Such spaces were introduced to study spectral theory in the broad sense. They bring together the 'bound state' (eigenvector) and 'continuous spectrum', in one place.","image":"676369f3a26f5874fb9925ecfede40651408534e.svg","url":"Rigged_Hilbert_space"}
