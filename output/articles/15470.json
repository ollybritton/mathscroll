{"title":"Takeuti–Feferman–Buchholz ordinal","summary":"In the mathematical fields of set theory and proof theory, the Takeuti–Feferman–Buchholz ordinal (TFBO) is a large countable ordinal, which acts as the limit of the range of Buchholz's psi function and Feferman's theta function.[1][2] It was named by David Madore,[2] after Gaisi Takeuti, Solomon Feferman and Wilfried Buchholz. It is written as ψ 0 ( ε Ω ω + 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\psi _{0}(\\varepsilon _{\\Omega _{\\omega }+1})} using Buchholz's psi function,[3] an ordinal collapsing function invented by Wilfried Buchholz,[4][5][6] and θ ε Ω ω + 1 ( 0 ) {\\displaystyle \\theta _{\\varepsilon _{\\Omega _{\\omega }+1}}(0)} in Feferman's theta function, an ordinal collapsing function invented by Solomon Feferman.[7][8] It is the proof-theoretic ordinal of several formal theories:","image":"a9625b6e8398972bba3379799dc72e57bb3db714.svg","url":"Takeuti–Feferman–Buchholz_ordinal"}
