{"title":"Källén function","summary":"The Källén function, also known as triangle function, is a polynomial function in three variables, which appears in geometry and particle physics. In the latter field it is usually denoted by the symbol λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } . It is named after the theoretical physicist Gunnar Källén, who introduced it as a short-hand in his textbook Elementary Particle Physics.[1]","image":"b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a.svg","url":"Källén_function"}
