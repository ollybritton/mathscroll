{"title":"Clipping (signal processing)","summary":"Clipping is a form of distortion that limits a signal once it exceeds a threshold.  Clipping may occur when a signal is recorded by a sensor that has constraints on the range of data it can measure, it can occur when a signal is digitized, or it can occur any other time an analog or digital signal is transformed, particularly in the presence of gain or overshoot and undershoot.","image":"Clipping_1KHz_10V_DIV_clip_A_5ohms-1-.jpg.webp","url":"Clipping_(signal_processing)"}
