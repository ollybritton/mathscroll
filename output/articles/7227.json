{"title":"Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel","summary":"Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel  (colloquial: Infinite Hotel Paradox or Hilbert's Hotel) is a thought experiment which illustrates a counterintuitive property of infinite sets. It is demonstrated that a fully occupied hotel with infinitely many rooms may still accommodate additional guests, even infinitely many of them, and this process may be repeated infinitely often. The idea was introduced by David Hilbert in a 1924 lecture \"Ãœber das Unendliche\", reprinted in (Hilbert 2013, p.730), and was popularized through George Gamow's 1947 book One Two Three... Infinity.[1][2]","image":"Hilbert's_Hotel.png.webp","url":"Hilbert's_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel"}
