{"title":"Albertson conjecture","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, the Albertson conjecture is an unproven relationship between the crossing number and the chromatic number of a graph. It is named after Michael O. Albertson, a professor at Smith College, who stated it as a conjecture in 2007;[1] it is one of his many conjectures in graph coloring theory.[2] The conjecture states that, among all graphs requiring n {\\displaystyle n} colors, the complete graph K n {\\displaystyle K_{n}} is the one with the smallest crossing number. Equivalently, if a graph can be drawn with fewer crossings than K n {\\displaystyle K_{n}} , then, according to the conjecture, it may be colored with fewer than n {\\displaystyle n} colors.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Albertson_conjecture"}
