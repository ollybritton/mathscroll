{"title":"Goldbach's comet","summary":"Goldbach's comet[1] is the name given to a plot of  the function g ( E ) {\\displaystyle g(E)} , the so-called Goldbach function (sequence A002372 in the OEIS).  The function, studied in relation to Goldbach's conjecture, is defined for all even integers E > 2 {\\displaystyle E>2} to be the number of different ways in which E can be expressed as the sum of two primes.  For example, g ( 22 ) = 3 {\\displaystyle g(22)=3} since 22 can be expressed as the sum of two primes in three different ways ( 22 = 11 + 11 = 5 + 17 = 3 + 19 {\\displaystyle 22=11+11=5+17=3+19} ).","image":"0cc6f6fcf06a7c595416e9f92905fa4936751fa3.svg","url":"Goldbach's_comet"}
