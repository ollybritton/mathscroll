{"title":"Lindelöf space","summary":"In mathematics, a Lindelöf space[1][2] is a topological space in which every open cover has a countable subcover. The Lindelöf property is a weakening of the more commonly used notion of compactness, which requires the existence of a finite subcover.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Lindelöf_space"}
