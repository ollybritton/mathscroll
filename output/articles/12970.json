{"title":"Quicksort","summary":"Quicksort is an efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm. Quicksort was developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959[1] and published in 1961.[2] It is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. Overall, it is slightly faster than merge sort and heapsort for randomized data, particularly on larger distributions.[3]","image":"Sorting_quicksort_anim.gif","url":"Quicksort"}
