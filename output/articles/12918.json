{"title":"Quasi-projective variety","summary":"In mathematics, a quasi-projective variety in algebraic geometry is a locally closed subset of a projective variety, i.e., the intersection inside some projective space of a Zariski-open and a Zariski-closed subset. A similar definition is used in scheme theory, where a quasi-projective scheme is a locally closed subscheme of some projective space.[1]","image":"458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025.svg","url":"Quasi-projective_variety"}
