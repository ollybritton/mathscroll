{"title":"Critical graph","summary":"In graph theory, a critical graph is an undirected graph all of whose subgraphs have smaller chromatic number. In such a graph, every vertex or edge is a critical element, in the sense that its deletion would decrease the number of colors needed in a graph coloring of the given graph. The decrease in the number of colors cannot be by more than one.","image":"Critical_graph_sample.svg.png.webp","url":"Critical_graph"}
