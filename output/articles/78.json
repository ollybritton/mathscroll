{"title":"3SUM","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the 3SUM problem asks if a given set of n {\\displaystyle n} real numbers contains three elements that sum to zero.  A generalized version, k-SUM, asks the same question on k numbers. 3SUM can be easily solved in O ( n 2 ) {\\displaystyle O(n^{2})} time, and matching Ω ( n ⌈ k / 2 ⌉ ) {\\displaystyle \\Omega (n^{\\lceil k/2\\rceil })} lower bounds are known in some specialized models of computation (Erickson 1999).","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"3SUM"}
