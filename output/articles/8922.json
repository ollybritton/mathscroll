{"title":"L-stability","summary":"Within mathematics regarding differential equations, L-stability is a special case of  A-stability, a property of Runge–Kutta methods for solving  ordinary differential equations. A method is L-stable if it is  A-stable and ϕ ( z ) → 0 {\\displaystyle \\phi (z)\\to 0} as z → ∞ {\\displaystyle z\\to \\infty } , where ϕ {\\displaystyle \\phi } is the stability function of the method (the stability function of a Runge–Kutta method is a rational function and thus the limit as z → + ∞ {\\displaystyle z\\to +\\infty } is the same as the limit as z → − ∞ {\\displaystyle z\\to -\\infty } ). L-stable methods are in general very good at integrating stiff equations.","image":"eae57eda3abcf96af836acddcf31296987e7232a.svg","url":"L-stability"}
