{"title":"Circumscription (logic)","summary":"Circumscription is a non-monotonic logic created by John McCarthy to formalize the common sense assumption that things are as expected unless otherwise specified.[1][2] Circumscription was later used by McCarthy in an attempt to solve the frame problem. To implement circumscription in its initial formulation, McCarthy augmented first-order logic  to allow the minimization of the extension of some predicates, where the extension of a predicate is the set of tuples of values the predicate is true on. This minimization is similar to the closed-world assumption that what is not known to be true is false.[3]","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Circumscription_(logic)"}
