{"title":"Group of Lie type","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in group theory, the phrase group of Lie type usually refers to finite groups that are closely related to the group of rational points of a reductive linear algebraic group with values in a finite field. The phrase group of Lie type does not have a widely accepted precise definition,[1] but the important collection of finite simple groups of Lie type does have a precise definition, and they make up most of the groups in the classification of finite simple groups.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Group_of_Lie_type"}
