{"title":"Stagnation point flow","summary":"In fluid dynamics, stagnation point flow represents the flow of a fluid in the immediate neighborhood of a stagnation point (or a stagnation line) with which the stagnation point (or the line) is identified for a potential flow or inviscid flow. The flow specifically considers a class of stagnation points known as saddle points where the incoming streamlines gets deflected and directed outwards in a different direction; the streamline deflections are guided by separatrices. The flow in the neighborhood of the stagnation point or line can generally be described using potential flow theory, although viscous effects cannot be neglected if the stagnation point lies on a solid surface.","image":"22a8c93372e8f8b6e24d523bd5545aed3430baf4.svg","url":"Stagnation_point_flow"}
