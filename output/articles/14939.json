{"title":"Star-free language","summary":"A regular language is said to be star-free if it can be described by a regular expression constructed from the letters of the alphabet, the empty set symbol, all boolean operators – including complementation – and concatenation but no Kleene star.[1]  For instance, the language of words over the alphabet { a , b } {\\displaystyle \\{a,\\,b\\}} that do not have consecutive a's can be defined by ( ∅ c a a ∅ c ) c {\\displaystyle (\\emptyset ^{c}aa\\emptyset ^{c})^{c}} , where X c {\\displaystyle X^{c}} denotes the complement of a subset X {\\displaystyle X} of { a , b } ∗ {\\displaystyle \\{a,\\,b\\}^{*}} .  The condition is equivalent to having generalized star height zero.","image":"65593f0b085cb1b85710bd66f6a81337f9a6c748.svg","url":"Star-free_language"}
