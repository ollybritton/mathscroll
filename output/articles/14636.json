{"title":"Social golfer problem","summary":"In discrete mathematics, the social golfer problem (SGP) is a combinatorial-design problem derived from a question posted in the usenet newsgroup sci.op-research in May 1998.[1] The problem is as follows: a group of 32 golfers plays golf once a week in groups of 4. Schedule these golfers to play for as many weeks as possible without any two golfers playing in the same group more than once.","image":"8c04777abbe53d314f756fdf90fe5c00c93e31d5.svg","url":"Social_golfer_problem"}
