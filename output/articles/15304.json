{"title":"Surface integral","summary":"In mathematics, particularly multivariable calculus, a surface integral  is a generalization of multiple integrals to integration over surfaces. It can be thought of as the double integral analogue of the line integral.  Given a surface, one may integrate a scalar field (that is, a function of position which returns a scalar as a value) over the surface, or a vector field (that is, a function which returns a vector as value). If a region R is not flat, then it is called a surface as shown in the illustration.","image":"Surface_integral_illustration.svg.png.webp","url":"Surface_integral"}
