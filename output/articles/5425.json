{"title":"Filtration (probability theory)","summary":"In the theory of stochastic processes, a subdiscipline of probability theory, filtrations are totally ordered collections of subsets that are used to model the information that is available at a given point and therefore play an important role in the formalization of random (stochastic) processes.","image":"dbc7f54d9e2ab1101bd16dcac877cce9860ae209.svg","url":"Filtration_(probability_theory)"}
