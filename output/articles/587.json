{"title":"Algebraic decision diagram","summary":"An Algebraic decision diagram (ADD) or a Multi-terminal binary decision diagram (MTBDD), is a data structure that is used to symbolically represent a Boolean function whose codomain is an arbitrary finite set S. An ADD is an extension of a reduced ordered binary decision diagram, or commonly named binary decision diagram (BDD) in the literature, which terminal nodes are not restricted to the Boolean values 0 (FALSE) and 1 (TRUE).[1][2] The terminal nodes may take any value from a set of constants S.","image":"3cc07e486d73e18382d0d8d205149f0923ed0586.svg","url":"Algebraic_decision_diagram"}
