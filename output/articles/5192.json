{"title":"Exposed point","summary":"In mathematics, an exposed point of a convex set C {\\displaystyle C} is a point x ∈ C {\\displaystyle x\\in C} at which some continuous linear functional attains its strict maximum over C {\\displaystyle C} . Such a functional is then said to expose x {\\displaystyle x} . There can be many exposing functionals for x {\\displaystyle x} . The set of exposed points of C {\\displaystyle C} is usually denoted exp ⁡ ( C ) {\\displaystyle \\exp(C)} .","image":"4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029.svg","url":"Exposed_point"}
