{"title":"Moving-cluster method","summary":"In astrometry, the moving-cluster method and the closely related convergent point method are means, primarily of historical interest, for determining the distance to star clusters. They were used on several nearby clusters in the first half of the 1900s to determine distance. The moving-cluster method is now largely superseded by other, usually more accurate distance measures.","image":"93485ac12b408a4d71e97b52c57bd4351e8efa8c.svg","url":"Moving-cluster_method"}
