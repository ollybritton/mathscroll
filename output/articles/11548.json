{"title":"Ordered pair","summary":"In mathematics, an ordered pair (a, b) is a pair of objects. The order in which the objects appear in the pair is significant: the ordered pair (a, b) is different from the ordered pair (b, a) unless a = b.  (In contrast, the unordered pair {a, b} equals the unordered pair {b, a}.)","image":"Ellipse_in_coordinate_system_with_semi-axes_labelled.svg.png.webp","url":"Ordered_pair"}
