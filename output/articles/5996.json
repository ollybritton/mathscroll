{"title":"Gaussian noise","summary":"Gaussian noise, named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, is a term from signal processing theory denoting a kind of signal noise that has a probability density function (pdf) equal to that of the normal distribution (which is also known as the Gaussian distribution).[1][2] In other words, the values that the noise can take are Gaussian-distributed.","image":"512x512-No-Noise.jpg.webp","url":"Gaussian_noise"}
