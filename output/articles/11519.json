{"title":"Order (group theory)","summary":"In mathematics, the order of a finite group is the number of its elements. If a group is not finite, one says that its order is infinite. The order of an element of a group (also called period length or period) is the order of the subgroup generated by the element. If the group operation is denoted as a multiplication, the order of an element a of a group, is thus the smallest positive integer m such that am = e, where e denotes the identity element of the group, and am denotes the product of m copies of a. If no such m exists, the order of a is infinite.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Order_(group_theory)"}
