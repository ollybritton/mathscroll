{"title":"Schottky's theorem","summary":"In mathematical complex analysis, Schottky's theorem, introduced by SchottkyÂ (1904) is a quantitative version of Picard's theorem. It states that for a holomorphic function f in the open unit disk that does not take the values 0 or 1, the value of |f(z)| can be bounded in terms of z and f(0).","image":"2bdfce72b49a80d63efec248f86efa364ca53497.svg","url":"Schottky's_theorem"}
