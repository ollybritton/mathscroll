{"title":"De Casteljau's algorithm","summary":"In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive method to evaluate polynomials in Bernstein form or Bézier curves, named after its inventor Paul de Casteljau. De Casteljau's algorithm can also be used to split a single Bézier curve into two Bézier curves at an arbitrary parameter value.","image":"47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a.svg","url":"De_Casteljau's_algorithm"}
