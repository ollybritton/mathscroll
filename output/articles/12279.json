{"title":"Polar curve","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the first polar, or simply polar of an algebraic plane curve C of degree n with respect to a point Q is an algebraic curve of degree n−1 which contains every point of C whose tangent line passes through Q. It is used to investigate the relationship between the curve and its dual, for example in the derivation of the Plücker formulas.","image":"PolarEllipticCurvePlot.svg.png.webp","url":"Polar_curve"}
