{"title":"Linear logic","summary":"Linear logic is a substructural logic proposed by Jean-Yves Girard as a refinement of classical and intuitionistic logic, joining the dualities of the former with many of the constructive properties of the latter.[1]  Although the logic has also been studied for its own sake, more broadly, ideas from linear logic have been influential in fields such as programming languages, game semantics, and quantum physics (because linear logic can be seen as the logic of quantum information theory),[2] as well as linguistics,[3] particularly because of its emphasis on resource-boundedness, duality, and interaction.","image":"a0c0d30cf8cb7dba179e317fcde9583d842e80f6.svg","url":"Linear_logic"}
