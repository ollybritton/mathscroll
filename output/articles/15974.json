{"title":"Transitively normal subgroup","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a subgroup of a group is said to be transitively normal in the group if every normal subgroup of the subgroup is also normal in the whole group. In symbols, H {\\displaystyle H} is a transitively normal subgroup of G {\\displaystyle G} if for every K {\\displaystyle K} normal in H {\\displaystyle H} , we have that K {\\displaystyle K} is normal in G {\\displaystyle G} .[1]","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Transitively_normal_subgroup"}
