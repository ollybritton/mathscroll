{"title":"Polynomial hierarchy","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the polynomial hierarchy (sometimes called the polynomial-time hierarchy) is a hierarchy of complexity classes that generalize the classes NP and co-NP.[1] Each class in the hierarchy is contained within PSPACE. The hierarchy can be defined using oracle machines or alternating Turing machines. It is a resource-bounded counterpart to the arithmetical hierarchy and analytical hierarchy from mathematical logic. The union of the classes in the hierarchy is denoted PH.","image":"432611e3ec555783e1e06e7b629030ac26f4ca2b.svg","url":"Polynomial_hierarchy"}
