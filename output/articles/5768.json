{"title":"Frobenius inner product","summary":"In mathematics, the Frobenius inner product is a binary operation that takes two matrices and returns a scalar. It is often denoted ⟨ A , B ⟩ F {\\displaystyle \\langle \\mathbf {A} ,\\mathbf {B} \\rangle _{\\mathrm {F} }} . The operation is a component-wise inner product of two matrices as though they are vectors, and satisfies the axioms for an inner product. The two matrices must have the same dimension - same number of rows and columns, but are not restricted to be square matrices.","image":"299a59172960b1d0ea55ff32754f42aec2ffba09.svg","url":"Frobenius_inner_product"}
