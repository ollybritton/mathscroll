{"title":"Vizing's theorem","summary":"In graph theory, Vizing's theorem states that every simple undirected graph may be edge colored using a number of colors that is at most one larger than the maximum degree Δ of the graph. At least Δ colors are always necessary, so the undirected graphs may be partitioned into two classes: \"class one\" graphs for which Δ colors suffice, and \"class two\" graphs for which Δ + 1 colors are necessary. A more general version of Vizing's theorem states that every undirected multigraph without loops can be colored with at most Δ+µ colors, where µ is the multiplicity of the multigraph. The theorem is named for Vadim G. Vizing who published it in 1964.","image":"a6421d2a08b4bafa7f377c40f1c29f4bcf2f34f1.svg","url":"Vizing's_theorem"}
