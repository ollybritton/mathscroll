{"title":"Godeaux surface","summary":"In mathematics, a Godeaux surface is one of the  surfaces of general type introduced by Lucien Godeaux in 1931. Other surfaces constructed in a similar way with the same Hodge numbers are also sometimes called Godeaux surfaces. Surfaces with the same Hodge numbers (such as  Barlow surfaces) are called numerical Godeaux surfaces.","image":"328bfee53c92c18ea910371b7d79ca9a3916c324.svg","url":"Godeaux_surface"}
