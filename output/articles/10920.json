{"title":"Named set theory","summary":"Named set theory is a branch of theoretical mathematics that studies the structures of names.  The named set is a theoretical concept that generalizes the structure of a name described by Frege.  Its generalization bridges the descriptivists theory of a name, and its triad structure (name, sensation and reference),[1] with mathematical structures that define mathematical names using triplets.  It deploys the former to view the latter at a higher abstract level that unifies a name and its relationship to a mathematical structure as a constructed reference.  This enables all names in science and technology to be treated as named sets or as systems of named sets.","image":"Fundamenttriad.jpg.webp","url":"Named_set_theory"}
