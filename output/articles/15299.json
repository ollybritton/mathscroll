{"title":"Surface","summary":"A surface, as the term is most generally used, is the outermost or uppermost layer of a physical object or space.[1][2] It is the portion or region of the object that can first be perceived by an observer using the senses of sight and touch, and is the portion with which other materials first interact. The surface of an object is more than \"a mere geometric solid\", but is \"filled with, spread over by, or suffused with perceivable qualities such as color and warmth\".[3]","image":"Red_Apple.jpg.webp","url":"Surface"}
