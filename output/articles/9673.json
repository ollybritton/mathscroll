{"title":"Logical NOR","summary":"In boolean logic, logical nor or joint denial is a truth-functional operator which produces a result that is the negation of logical or.  That is, a sentence of the form (p NOR q) is true precisely when neither p nor q is true—i.e. when both of p and q are false. It is logically equivalent to ¬ ( p ∨ q ) {\\displaystyle \\neg (p\\lor q)} and ¬ p ∧ ¬ q {\\displaystyle \\neg p\\land \\neg q} , where the symbol ¬ {\\displaystyle \\neg } signifies logical negation, ∨ {\\displaystyle \\lor } signifies OR, and ∧ {\\displaystyle \\land } signifies AND.","image":"714b59c527eaf19ba4b1980fd11899c53d479148.svg","url":"Logical_NOR"}
