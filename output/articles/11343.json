{"title":"Octahedral pyramid","summary":"In 4-dimensional geometry, the octahedral pyramid is bounded by one octahedron on the base and 8 triangular pyramid cells which meet at the apex. Since an octahedron has a circumradius divided by edge length less than one,[1] the triangular pyramids can be made with regular faces (as regular tetrahedrons) by computing the appropriate height.","image":"Octahedral_pyramid.png.webp","url":"Octahedral_pyramid"}
