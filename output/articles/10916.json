{"title":"Naive set theory","summary":"Naive set theory is any of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the foundations of mathematics.[3] Unlike axiomatic set theories, which are defined using formal logic, naive set theory is defined informally, in natural language. It describes the aspects of mathematical sets familiar in discrete mathematics (for example Venn diagrams and symbolic reasoning about their Boolean algebra), and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.[4]","image":"Passage_with_the_set_definition_of_Georg_Cantor.png.webp","url":"Naive_set_theory"}
