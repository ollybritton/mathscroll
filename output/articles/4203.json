{"title":"Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions","summary":"In number theory, Dirichlet's theorem, also called the Dirichlet prime number theorem, states that for any two positive coprime integers a and d, there are infinitely many primes of the form a + nd, where n is also a positive integer. In other words, there are infinitely many primes that are congruent to a modulo d. The numbers of the form a + nd form an arithmetic progression","image":"7b0dfeef2ac486920103ea18e9743ab9e08a7019.svg","url":"Dirichlet's_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions"}
