{"title":"Ten-of-diamonds decahedron","summary":"In geometry, the ten-of-diamonds decahedron is a space-filling polyhedron with 10 faces, 2 opposite rhombi with orthogonal major axes, connected by 8 identical isosceles triangle faces. Although it is convex, it is not a Johnson solid because its faces are not composed entirely of regular polygons. Michael Goldberg named it after a playing card, as a 10-faced polyhedron with two opposite rhombic (diamond-shaped) faces. He catalogued it in a 1982 paper as 10-II, the second in a list of 26 known space-filling decahedra.[1]","image":"Ten-of-diamonds_decahedron_skew.png.webp","url":"Ten-of-diamonds_decahedron"}
