{"title":"Tom Lehrer","summary":"Thomas Andrew Lehrer (/ˈlɛərər/; born April 9, 1928) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, satirist, and mathematician, who later taught mathematics and musical theater. He recorded pithy and humorous songs that became popular in the 1950s and 1960s. His songs often parodied popular musical forms, though they usually had original melodies. An exception is \"The Elements\", in which he set the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the \"Major-General's Song\" from Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance.","image":"Portrait_of_Tom_Lehrer_in_c._1957.jpg.webp","url":"Tom_Lehrer"}
