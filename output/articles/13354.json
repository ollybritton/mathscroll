{"title":"Relation (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a binary relation on a set  may, or may not, hold between two given set members. For example, \"is less than\" is a relation on the set of natural numbers; it holds e.g. between 1 and 3 (denoted as 1<3) , and likewise between 3 and 4 (denoted as 3<4), but neither between 3 and 1 nor between 4 and 4. As another example, \"is sister of\" is a relation on the set of all people, it holds e.g. between Marie Curie and Bronisława Dłuska, and likewise vice versa. Set members may not be in relation \"to a certain degree\" - either they are in relation or they are not.","image":"Relación_binaria_01.svg.png.webp","url":"Relation_(mathematics)"}
