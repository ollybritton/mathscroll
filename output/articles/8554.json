{"title":"Kac–Moody algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Kac–Moody algebra (named for Victor Kac and Robert Moody, who independently and simultaneously discovered them in 1968[1]) is a Lie algebra, usually infinite-dimensional, that can be defined by generators and relations through a generalized Cartan matrix. These algebras form a generalization of finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras, and many properties related to the structure of a Lie algebra such as its root system, irreducible representations, and connection to flag manifolds have natural analogues in the Kac–Moody setting.","image":"fa0439eb3ddf1386bfaf14850d2be0a57c71cd5d.svg","url":"Kac–Moody_algebra"}
