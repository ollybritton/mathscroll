{"title":"Multipole expansion","summary":"A multipole expansion is a mathematical series representing a function that depends on anglesâ€”usually the two angles used in the spherical coordinate system (the polar and azimuthal angles) for three-dimensional Euclidean space, R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} . Similarly to Taylor series, multipole expansions are useful because oftentimes only the first few terms are needed to provide a good approximation of the original function. The function being expanded may be real- or complex-valued and is defined either on R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} , or less often on R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} for some other n {\\displaystyle n} .","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg","url":"Multipole_expansion"}
