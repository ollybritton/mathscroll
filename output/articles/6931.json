{"title":"Hartogs's extension theorem","summary":"In the theory of functions of several complex variables, Hartogs's extension theorem is a statement about the singularities of holomorphic functions of several variables. Informally, it states that the support of the singularities of such functions cannot be compact, therefore the singular set of a function of several complex variables must (loosely speaking) 'go off to infinity' in some direction. More precisely, it shows that an isolated singularity is always a removable singularity  for any analytic function of n > 1 complex variables. A first version of this theorem was proved by Friedrich Hartogs,[1] and as such it is known also as Hartogs's lemma and Hartogs's principle: in earlier Soviet literature,[2] it is also called Osgoodâ€“Brown theorem, acknowledging later work by Arthur Barton Brown and William Fogg Osgood.[3] This property of holomorphic functions of several variables is also called Hartogs's phenomenon: however, the locution \"Hartogs's phenomenon\" is also used to identify the property of solutions of systems of partial differential or convolution equations satisfying Hartogs type theorems.[4]","image":"2e0d762b0554776973056060503cba5e1c36bac9.svg","url":"Hartogs's_extension_theorem"}
