{"title":"Elementary proof","summary":"In mathematics, an elementary proof is a mathematical proof that only uses basic techniques. More specifically, the term is used in number theory to refer to proofs that make no use of complex analysis. Historically, it was once thought that certain theorems, like the prime number theorem, could only be proved by invoking \"higher\" mathematical theorems or techniques. However, as time progresses, many of these results have also been subsequently reproven using only elementary techniques.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Elementary_proof"}
