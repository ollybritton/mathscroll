{"title":"Hodge–de Rham spectral sequence","summary":"In mathematics, the Hodge–de Rham spectral sequence (named in honor of  W. V. D. Hodge and Georges de Rham) is an alternative term sometimes used to describe   the Frölicher spectral sequence (named after Alfred Frölicher, who actually discovered it). This spectral sequence describes the precise relationship between   the Dolbeault cohomology and the de Rham cohomology of a general complex manifold. On a compact Kähler manifold, the sequence degenerates, thereby leading to the Hodge decomposition of the de Rham cohomology.","image":"81e849b1a127339f2d5f3f0a9d9087a08ae4af3d.svg","url":"Hodge–de_Rham_spectral_sequence"}
