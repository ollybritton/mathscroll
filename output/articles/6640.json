{"title":"Grover's algorithm","summary":"In quantum computing, Grover's algorithm, also known as the quantum search algorithm, refers to a quantum algorithm for unstructured search that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value, using just O ( N ) {\\displaystyle O({\\sqrt {N}})} evaluations of the function, where N {\\displaystyle N} is the size of the function's domain. It was devised by Lov Grover in 1996.[1]","image":"6a8566840a0a5d4480a0b8ed63d0717c3a89ec9a.svg","url":"Grover's_algorithm"}
