{"title":"q-Gaussian distribution","summary":"The q-Gaussian is a probability distribution arising from the maximization of the Tsallis entropy under appropriate constraints.  It is one example of a Tsallis distribution. The q-Gaussian is a generalization of the Gaussian in the same way that Tsallis entropy is a generalization of standard Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy or Shannon entropy.[1] The normal distribution is recovered as q → 1.","image":"The_PDF_of_QGaussian.svg.png.webp","url":"Q-Gaussian_distribution"}
