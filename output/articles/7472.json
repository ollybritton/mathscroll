{"title":"Hybrid system","summary":"A hybrid system is a dynamical system that exhibits both continuous and discrete dynamic behavior – a system that can both flow (described by a differential equation) and jump (described by a state machine or automaton).[1] Often, the term \"hybrid dynamical system\" is used, to distinguish over hybrid systems such as those that combine neural nets and fuzzy logic, or electrical and mechanical drivelines.  A hybrid system has the benefit of encompassing a larger class of systems within its structure, allowing for more flexibility in modeling dynamic phenomena.","image":"a8788bf85d532fa88d1fb25eff6ae382a601c308.svg","url":"Hybrid_system"}
