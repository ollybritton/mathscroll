{"title":"Chow group of a stack","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the Chow group of a stack is a generalization of the Chow group of a variety or scheme to stacks. For a quotient stack X = [ Y / G ] {\\displaystyle X=[Y/G]} , the Chow group of X is the same as the G-equivariant Chow group of Y.","image":"b32a8e64d11248e98a57c53de5cb5397ef8c2a92.svg","url":"Chow_group_of_a_stack"}
