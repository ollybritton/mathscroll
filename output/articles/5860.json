{"title":"Fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry","summary":"In the mathematical field of Riemannian geometry, the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry states that on any Riemannian manifold (or pseudo-Riemannian manifold) there is a unique affine connection that is torsion-free and metric-compatible, called the Levi-Civita connection or (pseudo-)Riemannian connection of the given metric. Because it is canonically defined by such properties, often this connection is automatically used when given a metric.","image":"0359e4c6363bb0e56521ba33ad049cece66d6dfd.svg","url":"Fundamental_theorem_of_Riemannian_geometry"}
