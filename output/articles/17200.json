{"title":"Zubov's method","summary":"Zubov's method is a technique for computing the basin of attraction for a set of ordinary differential equations (a dynamical system). The domain of attraction is the set { x : v ( x ) < 1 } {\\displaystyle \\{x:\\,v(x)<1\\}} , where v ( x ) {\\displaystyle v(x)} is the solution to a partial differential equation known as the Zubov equation.[1] Zubov's method can be used in a number of ways.","image":"483cd074adc7048d0ea5844e05be67eafa1f11e2.svg","url":"Zubov's_method"}
