{"title":"Cantor's first set theory article","summary":"Cantor's first set theory article contains Georg Cantor's first theorems of transfinite set theory, which studies infinite sets and their properties. One of these theorems is his \"revolutionary discovery\" that the set of all real numbers is uncountably, rather than countably, infinite.[1] This theorem is proved using Cantor's first uncountability proof, which differs from the more familiar proof using his diagonal argument. The title of the article, \"On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers\" (\"Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen\"), refers to its first theorem: the set of real algebraic numbers is countable. Cantor's article was published in 1874. In 1879, he modified his uncountability proof by using the topological notion of a set being dense in an interval.","image":"Georg_Cantor3.jpg.webp","url":"Cantor's_first_set_theory_article"}
