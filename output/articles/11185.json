{"title":"Nonlinear programming","summary":"In mathematics, nonlinear programming (NLP) is the process of solving an optimization problem where some of the constraints or the objective function are nonlinear. An optimization problem is one of calculation of the extrema (maxima, minima or stationary points) of an objective function over a set of unknown real variables and conditional to the satisfaction of a system of equalities and inequalities, collectively termed constraints. It is the sub-field of mathematical optimization that deals with problems that are not linear.","image":"7953a3185f4689d7b3a4d271b5c990207aa2c148.svg","url":"Nonlinear_programming"}
