{"title":"Numerical stability","summary":"In the mathematical subfield of numerical analysis, numerical stability is a generally desirable property of numerical algorithms. The precise definition of stability depends on the context. One is numerical linear algebra and the other is algorithms for solving ordinary and partial differential equations by discrete approximation.","image":"Forward_and_backward_error.svg.png.webp","url":"Numerical_stability"}
