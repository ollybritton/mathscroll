{"title":"List of mathematical symbols by subject","summary":"The following list of mathematical symbols by subject features a selection of the most common symbols used in modern mathematical notation within formulas, grouped by mathematical topic. As it is impossible to know if a complete list existing today of all symbols used in history is a representation of all ever used in history, as this would necessitate knowing if extant records are of all usages, only those symbols which occur often in mathematics or mathematics education are included. Many of the characters are standardized, for example in DIN 1302 General mathematical symbols or DIN EN ISO 80000-2 Quantities and units â€“ Part 2: Mathematical signs for science and technology.","image":"3fb423c16a5f403edbaf66438b75e7a36e725af6.svg","url":"List_of_mathematical_symbols_by_subject"}
