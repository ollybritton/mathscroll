{"title":"Stability (algebraic geometry)","summary":"In mathematics, and especially algebraic geometry, stability is a notion which characterises when a geometric object, for example a point, an algebraic variety, a vector bundle, or a sheaf, has some desirable properties for the purpose of classifying them. The exact characterisation of what it means to be stable depends on the type of geometric object, but all such examples share the property of having a minimal amount of internal symmetry, that is such stable objects have few automorphisms. This is related to the concept of simplicity in mathematics, which measures when some mathematical object has few subobjects inside it (see for example simple groups, which have no non-trivial normal subgroups). In addition to stability, some objects may be described with terms such as semi-stable (having a small but not minimal amount of symmetry), polystable (being made out of stable objects), or unstable (having too much symmetry, the opposite of stable).","image":"Hilbertâ€“Mumford_Criterion.png.webp","url":"Stability_(algebraic_geometry)"}
