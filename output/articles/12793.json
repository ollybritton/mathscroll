{"title":"q-exponential","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, a q-exponential is a q-analog of the exponential function, namely the eigenfunction of a q-derivative. There are many  q-derivatives, for example, the classical  q-derivative, the Askey-Wilson operator, etc. Therefore, unlike the classical exponentials, q-exponentials are not unique.  For example, e q ( z ) {\\displaystyle e_{q}(z)} is the q-exponential corresponding to the classical  q-derivative while E q ( z ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {E}}_{q}(z)} are eigenfunctions of the Askey-Wilson operators.","image":"1fb29e3dabbb70417100a4a9a70bd9875de1c315.svg","url":"Q-exponential"}
