{"title":"Mackey topology","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, the Mackey topology, named after George Mackey, is the finest topology for a topological vector space which still preserves the continuous dual. In other words the Mackey topology does not make linear functions continuous which were discontinuous in the default topology. A topological vector space (TVS) is called a Mackey space if its topology is the same as the Mackey topology.","image":"af302234dea357c347fb17e9bf3fd132a10d309a.svg","url":"Mackey_topology"}
