{"title":"Softmax function","summary":"The softmax function, also known as softargmax[1]: 184  or normalized exponential function,[2]: 198  converts a vector of K real numbers into a probability distribution of K possible outcomes. It is a generalization of the logistic function to multiple dimensions, and used in multinomial logistic regression. The softmax function is often used as the last activation function of a neural network to normalize the output of a network to a probability distribution over predicted output classes, based on Luce's choice axiom.","image":"Kernel_Machine.svg.png.webp","url":"Softmax_function"}
