{"title":"J-2 ring","summary":"In commutative algebra, a J-0 ring is a ring R {\\displaystyle R} such that the set of regular points, that is, points p {\\displaystyle p} of the spectrum at which the localization R p {\\displaystyle R_{p}} is a regular local ring, contains a non-empty open subset, a J-1 ring is a ring such that the set of regular points is an open subset, and a J-2 ring is a ring such that any finitely generated algebra over the ring is a J-1 ring.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"J-2_ring"}
