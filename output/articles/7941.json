{"title":"Intersection form of a 4-manifold","summary":"In mathematics, the intersection form of an oriented compact 4-manifold is a special symmetric bilinear form on the 2nd (co)homology group of the 4-manifold.  It reflects much of the topology of the 4-manifolds, including information on the existence of a smooth structure.","image":"5426ed7abdea7d2ff995ad0e01bc4ca62a273855.svg","url":"Intersection_form_of_a_4-manifold"}
