{"title":"Alexander duality","summary":"In mathematics, Alexander duality refers to a duality theory initiated by a result of J. W. Alexander in 1915, and subsequently further developed, particularly by Pavel Alexandrov and Lev Pontryagin. It applies to the homology theory properties of the complement of a subspace X in Euclidean space, a sphere, or other manifold. It is generalized by Spanierâ€“Whitehead duality.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Alexander_duality"}
