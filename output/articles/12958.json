{"title":"Quaternionic analysis","summary":"In mathematics, quaternionic analysis is the study of functions with quaternions as the domain and/or range. Such functions can be called functions of a quaternion variable just as functions of a real variable or a complex variable are called.","image":"5ab9c234103bb1d7aa3204bd23d84d6b35e93420.svg","url":"Quaternionic_analysis"}
