{"title":"Axiom of countable choice","summary":"The axiom of countable choice or axiom of denumerable choice, denoted ACω, is an axiom of set theory that states that every countable collection of non-empty sets must have a choice function. That is, given a function A with domain N (where N denotes the set of natural numbers) such that A(n) is a non-empty set for every n ∈ N, there exists a function f with domain N such that f(n) ∈ A(n) for every n ∈ N.","image":"Axiom_of_countable_choice.svg.png.webp","url":"Axiom_of_countable_choice"}
