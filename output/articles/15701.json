{"title":"Theta divisor","summary":"In mathematics, the theta divisor Θ is the divisor in the sense of algebraic geometry defined on an abelian variety A over the complex numbers (and principally polarized) by the zero locus of the associated Riemann theta-function. It is therefore an algebraic subvariety of A of dimension dim A − 1.","image":"3529a0d9820acf0123dee9d936a9286b3eb14896.svg","url":"Theta_divisor"}
