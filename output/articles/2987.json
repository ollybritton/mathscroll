{"title":"Complete topological vector space","summary":"In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, a complete topological vector space is a topological vector space (TVS) with the property that whenever points get progressively closer to each other, then there exists some point x {\\displaystyle x} towards which they all get closer. The notion of \"points that get progressively closer\" is made rigorous by Cauchy nets or Cauchy filters, which are generalizations of Cauchy sequences, while \"point x {\\displaystyle x} towards which they all get closer\" means that this Cauchy net or filter converges to x . {\\displaystyle x.} The notion of completeness for TVSs uses the theory of uniform spaces as a framework to generalize the notion of completeness for metric spaces. But unlike metric-completeness, TVS-completeness does not depend on any metric and is defined for all TVSs, including those that are not metrizable or Hausdorff.","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Complete_topological_vector_space"}
