{"title":"Fréchet derivative","summary":"In mathematics, the Fréchet derivative is a derivative defined on normed spaces. Named after Maurice Fréchet, it is commonly used to generalize the derivative of a real-valued function of a single real variable to the case of a vector-valued function of multiple real variables, and to define the functional derivative used widely in the calculus of variations.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Fréchet_derivative"}
