{"title":"Weak formulation","summary":"Weak formulations are important tools for the analysis of mathematical equations that permit the transfer of concepts of linear algebra to solve problems in other fields such as partial differential equations. In a weak formulation, equations or conditions are no longer required to hold absolutely (and this is not even well defined) and has instead weak solutions only with respect to certain \"test vectors\" or \"test functions\".  In a strong formulation, the solution space is constructed such that these equations or conditions are already fulfilled.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Weak_formulation"}
