{"title":"Counterexample","summary":"A counterexample is any exception to a generalization.  In logic a counterexample disproves the generalization, and does so rigorously in the fields of mathematics and philosophy.[1] For example, the fact that \"student John Smith is not lazy\" is a counterexample to the generalization “students are lazy”, and both a counterexample to, and disproof of, the universal quantification “all students are lazy.”[2]","image":"Wikiquote-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Counterexample"}
