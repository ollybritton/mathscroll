{"title":"Leaky integrator","summary":"In mathematics, a leaky integrator equation is a specific differential equation,  used to describe a component or system that takes the integral of an input, but gradually leaks a small amount of input over time. It appears commonly in hydraulics, electronics, and neuroscience where it can represent either a single neuron or a local population of neurons.[1]","image":"Leakyintegrator.png.webp","url":"Leaky_integrator"}
