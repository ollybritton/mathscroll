{"title":"Analytic continuation","summary":"In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, analytic continuation is a technique to extend the domain of definition of a given analytic function. Analytic continuation often succeeds in defining further values of a function, for example in a new region where an infinite series representation in terms of which it is initially defined becomes divergent.","image":"Imaginary_log_analytic_continuation.png.webp","url":"Analytic_continuation"}
