{"title":"Wijsman convergence","summary":"Wijsman convergence is a variation of Hausdorff convergence suitable for work with unbounded sets. Intuitively, Wijsman convergence is to convergence in the Hausdorff metric as pointwise convergence is to uniform convergence.","image":"b1be38aa86db2ef6cd500c6a3fc9f251896936e6.svg","url":"Wijsman_convergence"}
