{"title":"Symplectic representation","summary":"In mathematical field of representation theory, a symplectic representation is a representation of a group or a Lie algebra on a symplectic vector space (V, ω) which preserves the symplectic form ω. Here ω is a nondegenerate skew symmetric bilinear form","image":"ca4d18b529ae297501d3aaf4125c72bb58de3735.svg","url":"Symplectic_representation"}
