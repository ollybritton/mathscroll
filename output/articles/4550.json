{"title":"Dynamical billiards","summary":"A dynamical billiard is a dynamical system in which a particle alternates between free motion (typically as a straight line) and specular reflections from a boundary.  When the particle hits the boundary it reflects from it without loss of speed (i.e. elastic collisions).  Billiards are Hamiltonian idealizations of the game of billiards, but where the region contained by the boundary can have shapes other than rectangular and even be multidimensional. Dynamical billiards may also be studied on non-Euclidean geometries; indeed, the first studies of billiards established their ergodic motion on surfaces of constant negative curvature. The study of billiards which are kept out of a region, rather than being kept in a region, is known as outer billiard theory.","image":"Stadium_billiard.gif","url":"Dynamical_billiards"}
