{"title":"Least-squares spectral analysis","summary":"Least-squares spectral analysis (LSSA) is a method of estimating a frequency spectrum based on a least-squares fit of sinusoids to data samples, similar to Fourier analysis.[1][2] Fourier analysis, the most used spectral method in science, generally boosts long-periodic noise in the long and gapped records; LSSA mitigates such problems.[3] Unlike in Fourier analysis, data need not be equally spaced to use LSSA.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Least-squares_spectral_analysis"}
