{"title":"Kloosterman sum","summary":"In mathematics, a Kloosterman sum is a particular kind of exponential sum. They are named for the Dutch mathematician Hendrik Kloosterman, who introduced them in 1926[1] when he adapted the Hardyâ€“Littlewood circle method to tackle a problem involving positive definite diagonal quadratic forms in four as opposed to five or more variables, which  he had dealt with in his dissertation in 1924.[2]","image":"c994b5f6cc218b724b96a8ac8b0192662121969f.svg","url":"Kloosterman_sum"}
