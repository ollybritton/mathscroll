{"title":"Hüseyin Tevfik Pasha","summary":"Hüseyin Tevfik Pasha (1832 in Vidin, Ottoman Empire (now in Bulgaria) – 16 June 1901 in Constantinople (now Istanbul)) was a Turkish mathematician[1] and military adjutant representing Turkey in the purchase of foreign rifles. He is remembered for his Linear Algebra (1882, 1892) which outlined some vector algebra including a \"special perpendicular\" (cross product) and properties of curves. The book title was precocious since the early vector algebra was generalized in vector space, and this concept later produced linear algebra. He is known as Tawfiq Pasha of Vidin or as Vidinli Huseyin, Tawfiq Pasha in Turkish literature.[2] He served as Envoy of the Ottoman Empire to the United States.","image":"Vidinli_Tawfik_Pasha.jpg.webp","url":"Hüseyin_Tevfik_Pasha"}
