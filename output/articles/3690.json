{"title":"Cyclic order","summary":"In mathematics, a cyclic order is a way to arrange a set of objects in a circle.[nb] Unlike most structures in order theory, a cyclic order is not modeled as a binary relation, such as \"a < b\". One does not say that east is \"more clockwise\" than west. Instead, a cyclic order is defined as a ternary relation [a, b, c], meaning \"after a, one reaches b before c\". For example, [June, October, February], but not [June, February, October], cf. picture. A ternary relation is called a cyclic order if it is cyclic, asymmetric, transitive, and connected. Dropping the \"connected\" requirement results in a partial cyclic order.","image":"Months_circle_svg.svg.png.webp","url":"Cyclic_order"}
