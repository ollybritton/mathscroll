{"title":"Silver ratio","summary":"In mathematics, two quantities are in the silver ratio (or silver mean)[1][2] if the ratio of the smaller of those two quantities to the larger quantity is the same as the ratio of the larger quantity to the sum of the smaller quantity and twice the larger quantity (see below). This defines the silver ratio as an irrational mathematical constant, whose value of one plus the square root of 2 is approximately 2.4142135623. Its name is an allusion to the golden ratio; analogously to the way the golden ratio is the limiting ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, the silver ratio is the limiting ratio of consecutive Pell numbers. The silver ratio is denoted by Î´S.","image":"Silver_rectangle.svg.png.webp","url":"Silver_ratio"}
