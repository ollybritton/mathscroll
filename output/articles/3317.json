{"title":"Continuous embedding","summary":"In mathematics, one normed vector space is said to be continuously embedded in another normed vector space if the inclusion function between them is continuous. In some sense, the two norms are \"almost equivalent\", even though they are not both defined on the same space. Several of the Sobolev embedding theorems are continuous embedding theorems.","image":"9d536e503f88ccef31f112a8f06332bd00dd1efe.svg","url":"Continuous_embedding"}
