{"title":"Beeman's algorithm","summary":"Beeman's algorithm is a method for numerically integrating ordinary differential equations of order 2, more specifically Newton's equations of motion x ¨ = A ( x ) {\\displaystyle {\\ddot {x}}=A(x)} . It was designed to allow high numbers of particles in simulations of molecular dynamics. There is a direct or explicit and an implicit variant of the method. The direct variant was published by Schofield in 1973[1] as a personal communication from Beeman.  This is what is commonly known as Beeman's method. It is a variant of the Verlet integration method.  It produces identical positions, but uses a different formula for the velocities. Beeman in 1976 published[2] a class of implicit (predictor–corrector) multi-step methods, where Beeman's method is the direct variant of the third-order method in this class.","image":"9d248433b0868562ffc77dc0a71d7529060e26c8.svg","url":"Beeman's_algorithm"}
