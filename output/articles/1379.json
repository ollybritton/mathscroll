{"title":"Bateman–Horn conjecture","summary":"In number theory, the Bateman–Horn conjecture is a statement concerning the frequency of prime numbers among the values of a system of polynomials, named after mathematicians Paul T. Bateman and Roger A. Horn who proposed it in 1962. It provides a vast generalization of such conjectures as the Hardy and Littlewood conjecture on the density of twin primes or their conjecture on primes of the form n2 + 1; it is also a strengthening of Schinzel's hypothesis H.","image":"1fc82a7f5cff02d7fd9cbfa2a32a584c3c8e2932.svg","url":"Bateman–Horn_conjecture"}
