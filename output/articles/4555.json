{"title":"Dynkin system","summary":"A Dynkin system,[1] named after Eugene Dynkin is a collection of subsets of another universal set Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } satisfying a set of axioms weaker than those of 𝜎-algebra.  Dynkin systems are sometimes referred to as 𝜆-systems (Dynkin himself used this term) or d-system.[2] These set families have applications in measure theory and probability.","image":"24b0d5ca6f381068d756f6337c08e0af9d1eeb6f.svg","url":"Dynkin_system"}
