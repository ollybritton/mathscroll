{"title":"Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test","summary":"In computational number theory, the Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test is an algorithm for determining whether a number is prime. Unlike other, more efficient algorithms for this purpose, it avoids the use of random numbers, so it is a deterministic primality test. It is named after its discoverers, Leonard Adleman, Carl Pomerance, and Robert Rumely. The test involves arithmetic in cyclotomic fields.","image":"81ce3e8328fb096b82c51ad46a3cc5124bc5d2d9.svg","url":"Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely_primality_test"}
