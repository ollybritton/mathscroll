{"title":"Cartesian coordinate system","summary":"In geometry, a Cartesian coordinate system (UK: /kɑːˈtiːzjən/, US: /kɑːrˈtiʒən/) in a plane is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely by a pair of real numbers called  coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, called coordinate lines, coordinate axes or just axes (plural of axis) of the system. The point where they meet is called the origin and has  (0, 0) as coordinates.","image":"Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg.png.webp","url":"Cartesian_coordinate_system"}
