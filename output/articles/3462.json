{"title":"Correlogram","summary":"In the analysis of data, a correlogram is a chart of correlation statistics. For example, in time series analysis, a plot of the sample autocorrelations r h {\\displaystyle r_{h}\\,} versus h {\\displaystyle h\\,} (the time lags) is an autocorrelogram. If cross-correlation is plotted, the result is called a cross-correlogram.","image":"cbf4185333d5e2b7ad63c746e3775b51ecc56748.svg","url":"Correlogram"}
