{"title":"Harmonic morphism","summary":"In mathematics, a harmonic morphism is a (smooth) map ϕ : ( M m , g ) → ( N n , h ) {\\displaystyle \\phi :(M^{m},g)\\to (N^{n},h)} between Riemannian manifolds that pulls back real-valued harmonic functions on the codomain to harmonic functions on the domain. Harmonic morphisms form a special class of harmonic maps i.e. those that are horizontally (weakly) conformal.[1]","image":"d8596f70e1ee0c00d31c5279451d068439d98b89.svg","url":"Harmonic_morphism"}
