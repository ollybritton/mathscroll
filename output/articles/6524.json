{"title":"Great ellipse","summary":"A great ellipse is an ellipse passing through two points on a spheroid and having the same center as that of the spheroid. Equivalently, it is an ellipse on the surface of a spheroid and centered on the origin, or the curve formed by intersecting the spheroid by a plane through its center.[1] For points that are separated by less than about a quarter of the circumference of the earth, about 10 000 k m {\\displaystyle 10\\,000\\,\\mathrm {km} } , the length of the great ellipse connecting the points is close (within one part in 500,000) to the geodesic distance.[2][3][4] The great ellipse therefore is sometimes proposed as a suitable route for marine navigation. The great ellipse is special case of an earth section path.","image":"c2afd4071a9aa917f5f4918f2d9d913cb8dbc01d.svg","url":"Great_ellipse"}
