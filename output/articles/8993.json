{"title":"Landau prime ideal theorem","summary":"In algebraic number theory, the prime ideal theorem is the number field generalization of the prime number theorem. It provides an asymptotic formula for counting the number of prime ideals of a number field K, with norm at most X.","image":"65818c07476993926b996092da85aaafebc49890.svg","url":"Landau_prime_ideal_theorem"}
