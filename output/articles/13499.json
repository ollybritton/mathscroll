{"title":"Rice's formula","summary":"In probability theory, Rice's formula counts the average number of times an ergodic stationary process X(t) per unit time crosses a fixed level u.[1] Adler and Taylor describe the result as \"one of the most important results in the applications of smooth stochastic processes.\"[2] The formula is often used in engineering.[3]","image":"309f96ffa21961c9ffb57a85e56a17c8e20c393a.svg","url":"Rice's_formula"}
