{"title":"Square class","summary":"In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, a square class of a field F {\\displaystyle F} is an element of the square class group, the quotient group F × / F × 2 {\\displaystyle F^{\\times }/F^{\\times 2}} of the multiplicative group of nonzero elements in the field modulo the square elements of the field. Each square class is a subset of the nonzero elements (a coset of the multiplicative group) consisting of the elements of the form xy2 where x is some particular fixed element and y ranges over all nonzero field elements.[1]","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"Square_class"}
