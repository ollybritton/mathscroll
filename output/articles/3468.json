{"title":"Costa's minimal surface","summary":"In mathematics, Costa's minimal surface, is an embedded minimal surface discovered in 1982 by the Brazilian mathematician Celso Jos√© da Costa. It is also a surface of finite topology, which means that it can be formed by puncturing a compact surface. Topologically, it is a thrice-punctured torus.","image":"Flower_Costa_minimal_surface.stl.png.webp","url":"Costa's_minimal_surface"}
