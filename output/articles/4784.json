{"title":"Elongated pentagonal rotunda","summary":"In geometry, the elongated pentagonal rotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J21). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal rotunda (J6) by attaching a decagonal prism to its base. It can also be seen as an elongated pentagonal orthobirotunda (J42) with one pentagonal rotunda removed.","image":"Elongated_pentagonal_rotunda.png.webp","url":"Elongated_pentagonal_rotunda"}
