{"title":"Qvist's theorem","summary":"In projective geometry, Qvist's theorem, named after the Finnish mathematician Bertil Qvist, is a statement on ovals in finite projective planes. Standard examples of ovals are non-degenerate (projective) conic sections. The theorem gives an answer to the question How many tangents to an oval can pass through a point in a finite projective plane? The answer depends essentially upon the order (number of points on a line âˆ’1) of the plane.","image":"Qvist-0-en.svg.png.webp","url":"Qvist's_theorem"}
