{"title":"Oval (projective plane)","summary":"In projective geometry an oval is a  point set  in a plane that is defined by incidence properties. The standard examples are the nondegenerate conics. However, a conic is only defined in a pappian plane, whereas an oval may exist in any type of projective plane. In the literature, there are many criteria which imply that an oval is a conic, but there are many examples, both infinite and finite, of ovals in pappian planes which are not conics.","image":"Oval-definition-en.svg.png.webp","url":"Oval_(projective_plane)"}
