{"title":"Fréchet inception distance","summary":"The Fréchet inception distance (FID) is a metric used to assess the quality of images created by a generative model, like a generative adversarial network (GAN).[1][2] Unlike the earlier inception score (IS), which evaluates only the distribution of generated images, the FID compares the distribution of generated images with the distribution of a set of real images (\"ground truth\").[1]","image":"489a4ac1b5d76663fa5328e6f3c1d382655cb496.svg","url":"Fréchet_inception_distance"}
