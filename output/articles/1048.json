{"title":"Artin–Rees lemma","summary":"In mathematics, the Artin–Rees lemma is a basic result about modules over a Noetherian ring, along with results such as the Hilbert basis theorem. It was proved in the 1950s in independent works by the mathematicians Emil Artin and David Rees;[1][2] a special case was known to Oscar Zariski prior to their work.","image":"a26b75aba2d4edd94bdb3b2827a71e91e177b92e.svg","url":"Artin–Rees_lemma"}
