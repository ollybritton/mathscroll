{"title":"Local Tate duality","summary":"In Galois cohomology, local Tate duality (or simply local duality) is a duality for Galois modules for the absolute Galois group of a non-archimedean local field. It is named after John Tate who first proved it. It shows that the dual of such a Galois module is the Tate twist of usual linear dual. This new dual is called the (local) Tate dual.","image":"1734d988a057c954f3b2c69f1ed7ea12b606265a.svg","url":"Local_Tate_duality"}
