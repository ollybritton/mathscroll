{"title":"Sobolev spaces for planar domains","summary":"In mathematics, Sobolev spaces for planar domains are one of the principal techniques used in the theory of partial differential equations for solving the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems for the Laplacian in a bounded domain in the plane with smooth boundary. The methods use the theory of bounded operators on Hilbert space. They can be used to deduce regularity properties of solutions and to solve the corresponding eigenvalue problems.","image":"442689d884de67c0b125fad98a81d2160a372986.svg","url":"Sobolev_spaces_for_planar_domains"}
