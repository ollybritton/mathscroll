{"title":"Planigon","summary":"In geometry, a planigon is a convex polygon that can fill the plane with only copies of itself (isotopic to the fundamental units of monohedral tessellations). In the Euclidean plane there are 3 regular planigons; equilateral triangle, squares, and regular hexagons; and 8 semiregular planigons; and 4 demiregular planigons which can tile the plane only with other planigons.","image":"All_Planigons.svg.png.webp","url":"Planigon"}
