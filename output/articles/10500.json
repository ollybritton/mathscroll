{"title":"Minimum bounding rectangle","summary":"In computational geometry, the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR), also known as bounding box (BBOX) or envelope, is an expression of the maximum extents of a two-dimensional object (e.g. point, line, polygon) or set of objects within its x-y coordinate system; in other words min(x), max(x), min(y), max(y). The MBR is a 2-dimensional case of the minimum bounding box.","image":"Minimum_bounding_rectangle.svg.png.webp","url":"Minimum_bounding_rectangle"}
