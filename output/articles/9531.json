{"title":"List of planar symmetry groups","summary":"This article summarizes the classes of discrete symmetry groups of the Euclidean plane. The symmetry groups are named here by three naming schemes: International notation, orbifold notation, and Coxeter notation. There are three kinds of symmetry groups of the plane:","image":"CDel_node_h2.png.webp","url":"List_of_planar_symmetry_groups"}
