{"title":"VEGAS algorithm","summary":"The VEGAS algorithm, due to G. Peter Lepage,[1][2][3] is a method for reducing error in Monte Carlo simulations by using a known or approximate probability distribution function to concentrate the search in those areas of the integrand that make the greatest contribution to the final integral.","image":"fcd44219cf38ef71f90bd3ba8a4e2393e8df9dbd.svg","url":"VEGAS_algorithm"}
