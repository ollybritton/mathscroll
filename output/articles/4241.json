{"title":"Discrete Chebyshev transform","summary":"In applied mathematics, the discrete Chebyshev transform (DCT), named after Pafnuty Chebyshev, is either of two main varieties of DCTs: the discrete Chebyshev transform on the 'roots' grid of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind T n ( x ) {\\displaystyle T_{n}(x)} and the discrete Chebyshev transform on the 'extrema' grid of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind.","image":"189f6ee3c1d17d5b774aa7d9555947d017c8f43d.svg","url":"Discrete_Chebyshev_transform"}
