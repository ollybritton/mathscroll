{"title":"Outer automorphism group","summary":"In mathematics, the outer automorphism group of a group, G, is the quotient, Aut(G) / Inn(G), where Aut(G) is the automorphism group of G and Inn(G) is the subgroup consisting of inner automorphisms. The outer automorphism group is usually denoted Out(G). If Out(G) is trivial and G has a trivial center, then G is said to be complete.","image":"e359a824ec3dc05384c5859d0a2af4bc12952600.svg","url":"Outer_automorphism_group"}
