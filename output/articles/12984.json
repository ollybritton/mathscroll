{"title":"Quotient","summary":"In arithmetic, a quotient (from Latin: quotiens 'how many times', pronounced /ˈkwoʊʃənt/) is a quantity produced by the division of two numbers.[1]  The quotient has widespread use throughout mathematics, and is commonly referred to as the integer part of a division (in the case of Euclidean division),[2] or as a fraction or a ratio (in the case of proper division).  For example, when dividing 20 (the dividend) by 3 (the divisor), the quotient is \"6 with a remainder of 2\" in the Euclidean division sense, and 6 2 3 {\\displaystyle 6{\\tfrac {2}{3}}} in the proper division sense. In the second sense, a quotient is simply the ratio of a dividend to its divisor.","image":"53a146fb6693547d1f2677c0405059c500c405ac.svg","url":"Quotient"}
