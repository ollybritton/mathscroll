{"title":"Logical biconditional","summary":"In logic and mathematics, the logical biconditional, sometimes known as the material biconditional, is the logical connective ( ↔ {\\displaystyle \\leftrightarrow } ) used to conjoin two statements P and Q to form the statement \"P if and only if Q\", where P is known as the antecedent, and Q the consequent.[1][2] This is often abbreviated as \"P iff Q\".[3] Other ways of denoting this operator may be seen occasionally, as a double-headed arrow (↔[4] or ⇔[5] may be represented in Unicode in various ways), a prefixed E \"Epq\" (in Łukasiewicz notation or Bocheński notation), an equality sign (=), an equivalence sign (≡),[3] or EQV. It is logically equivalent to both ( P → Q ) ∧ ( Q → P ) {\\displaystyle (P\\rightarrow Q)\\land (Q\\rightarrow P)} and ( P ∧ Q ) ∨ ( ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q ) {\\displaystyle (P\\land Q)\\lor (\\neg P\\land \\neg Q)} , and the XNOR (exclusive nor) boolean operator, which means \"both or neither\".","image":"046b918c43e05caf6624fe9b676c69ec9cd6b892.svg","url":"Logical_biconditional"}
