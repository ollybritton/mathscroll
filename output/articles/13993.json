{"title":"Schwartz kernel theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Schwartz kernel theorem is a foundational result in the theory of generalized functions, published by Laurent Schwartz in 1952. It states, in broad terms, that the generalized functions introduced by Schwartz (Schwartz distributions) have a two-variable theory that includes all reasonable bilinear forms on the space D {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {D}}} of test functions. The space D {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {D}}} itself consists of smooth functions of compact support.","image":"3277962e1959c3241fb1b70c7f0ac6dcefebd966.svg","url":"Schwartz_kernel_theorem"}
