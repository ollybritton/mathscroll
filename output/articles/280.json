{"title":"Absolute value","summary":"In mathematics, the absolute value or modulus of a real number x {\\displaystyle x} , denoted | x | {\\displaystyle |x|} , is the non-negative value of x {\\displaystyle x} without regard to its sign. Namely, | x | = x {\\displaystyle |x|=x} if x {\\displaystyle x} is a positive number, and | x | = − x {\\displaystyle |x|=-x} if x {\\displaystyle x} is negative (in which case negating x {\\displaystyle x} makes − x {\\displaystyle -x} positive), and | 0 | = 0 {\\displaystyle |0|=0} . For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Absolute_value"}
