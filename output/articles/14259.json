{"title":"Shapiro polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the Shapiro polynomials are a sequence of polynomials which were first studied by Harold S. Shapiro in 1951 when considering the magnitude of specific trigonometric sums.[1] In signal processing, the Shapiro polynomials have good autocorrelation properties and their values on the unit circle are small.[2]  The first few members of the sequence are:","image":"02027241b09240cf0fdd0034b6669315f041888e.svg","url":"Shapiro_polynomials"}
