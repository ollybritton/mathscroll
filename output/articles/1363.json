{"title":"Basis expansion time-frequency analysis","summary":"Linear expansions in a single basis, whether it is a Fourier series, wavelet, or any other basis, are not suitable enough. A Fourier basis provided a poor representation of functions well localized in time, and wavelet bases are not well adapted to represent functions whose Fourier transforms have a narrow high frequency support. In both cases, it is difficult to detect and identify the signal patterns from their expansion coefficients, because the information is diluted across the whole basis. Therefore, we must use large amounts of Fourier basis or Wavelets to represent whole signal with small approximation error. Some matching pursuit algorithms are proposed in reference papers to minimize approximation error when given the amount of basis.","image":"cadab28f7a83b948134c884b856be32f9ff9b57d.svg","url":"Basis_expansion_time-frequency_analysis"}
