{"title":"Ornstein isomorphism theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Ornstein isomorphism theorem is a deep result in ergodic theory.  It states that if two Bernoulli schemes have the same Kolmogorov entropy, then they are  isomorphic.[1][2] The result, given by Donald Ornstein in 1970, is important because it states that many systems previously believed to be unrelated are in fact isomorphic; these include all finite stationary stochastic processes, including Markov chains and subshifts of finite type, Anosov flows and Sinai's billiards, ergodic automorphisms of the n-torus, and the continued fraction transform.","image":"e8e8402d1ca8a7b2544de9e83db1c7580d80f6b7.svg","url":"Ornstein_isomorphism_theorem"}
