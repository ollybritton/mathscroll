{"title":"Maximal lotteries","summary":"Maximal lotteries refers to a probabilistic voting system first considered by the French mathematician and social scientist Germain Kreweras[1] in 1965. The method uses preferential ballots and returns so-called maximal lotteries, i.e., probability distributions over the alternatives that are weakly preferred to any other probability distribution. Maximal lotteries satisfy the Condorcet criterion,[2] the Smith criterion,[2] reversal symmetry, polynomial runtime, and probabilistic versions of reinforcement,[3] participation,[4] and independence of clones.[3]","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Maximal_lotteries"}
