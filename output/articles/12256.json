{"title":"Point groups in three dimensions","summary":"In geometry, a point group in three dimensions is an isometry group in three dimensions that leaves the origin fixed, or correspondingly, an isometry group of a sphere. It is a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(3), the group of all isometries that leave the origin fixed, or correspondingly, the group of orthogonal matrices. O(3) itself is a subgroup of the Euclidean group E(3) of all isometries.","image":"Sphere_symmetry_group_cs.png.webp","url":"Point_groups_in_three_dimensions"}
