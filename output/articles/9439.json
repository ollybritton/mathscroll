{"title":"List of International Mathematical Olympiads","summary":"The first of the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs) was held in Romania in 1959. The oldest of the International Science Olympiads, the IMO has since been held annually, except in 1980. That year, the competition initially planned to be held in Mongolia was cancelled due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.[1] Because the competition was initially founded for Eastern European countries participating in the Warsaw Pact, under the influence of the Eastern Bloc,[2] the earlier IMOs were hosted only in Eastern European countries, gradually spreading to other nations.[3] Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs and the exact dates when they took place.[4]","image":"IMO_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_International_Mathematical_Olympiads"}
