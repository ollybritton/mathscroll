{"title":"Fischer's inequality","summary":"In mathematics, Fischer's inequality gives an upper bound for the determinant of a  positive-semidefinite matrix whose entries are complex numbers in terms of the determinants of its principal diagonal blocks. Suppose A, C are respectively p×p, q×q positive-semidefinite complex matrices and B is a p×q complex matrix. Let","image":"2ef3250b13425beae7af2115f00a825f7b7152a2.svg","url":"Fischer's_inequality"}
