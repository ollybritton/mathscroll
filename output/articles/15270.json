{"title":"Superfactorial","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically number theory, the superfactorial of a positive integer n {\\displaystyle n} is the product of the first n {\\displaystyle n} factorials. They are a special case of the Jordan–Pólya numbers, which are products of arbitrary collections of factorials.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Superfactorial"}
