{"title":"Mark and recapture","summary":"Mark and recapture is a method commonly used in ecology to estimate an animal population's size where it is impractical to count every individual.[1] A portion of the population is captured, marked, and released. Later, another portion will be captured and the number of marked individuals within the sample is counted. Since the number of marked individuals within the second sample should be proportional to the number of marked individuals in the whole population, an estimate of the total population size can be obtained by dividing the number of marked individuals by the proportion of marked individuals in the second sample. Other names for this method, or closely related methods, include capture-recapture, capture-mark-recapture, mark-recapture, sight-resight, mark-release-recapture, multiple systems estimation, band recovery, the Petersen method,[2] and the Lincoln method.","image":"Novisuccinea_chittenangoensis_5.png.webp","url":"Mark_and_recapture"}
