{"title":"Monotonically normal space","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in the field of topology, a monotonically normal space is a particular kind of normal space, defined in terms of a monotone normality operator.  It satisfies some interesting properties; for example metric spaces and linearly ordered spaces are monotonically normal, and every monotonically normal space is hereditarily normal.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Monotonically_normal_space"}
