{"title":"Jeu de taquin","summary":"In the mathematical field of combinatorics, jeu de taquin  is a construction due to Marcel-Paul Schützenberger (1977) which defines an equivalence relation on the set of skew standard Young tableaux. A jeu de taquin slide is a transformation where the numbers in a tableau are moved around in a way similar to how the pieces in the fifteen puzzle move.  Two tableaux are jeu de taquin equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a sequence of such slides.","image":"Jeu_de_taquin.svg.png.webp","url":"Jeu_de_taquin"}
