{"title":"Totative","summary":"In number theory, a totative of a given positive integer n is an integer k such that 0 < k ≤ n and k is coprime to n.  Euler's totient function φ(n) counts the number of totatives of n.  The totatives under multiplication modulo n form the multiplicative group of integers modulo n.","image":"b034645e8b3dc341d5c284af0b4bb187b167a47d.svg","url":"Totative"}
