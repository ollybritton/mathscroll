{"title":"Radial basis function","summary":"A radial basis function (RBF) is a real-valued function φ {\\textstyle \\varphi } whose value depends only on the distance between the input and some fixed point, either the origin, so that φ ( x ) = φ ^ ( ‖ x ‖ ) {\\textstyle \\varphi (\\mathbf {x} )={\\hat {\\varphi }}(\\left\\|\\mathbf {x} \\right\\|)} , or some other fixed point c {\\textstyle \\mathbf {c} } , called a center, so that φ ( x ) = φ ^ ( ‖ x − c ‖ ) {\\textstyle \\varphi (\\mathbf {x} )={\\hat {\\varphi }}(\\left\\|\\mathbf {x} -\\mathbf {c} \\right\\|)} . Any function φ {\\textstyle \\varphi } that satisfies the property φ ( x ) = φ ^ ( ‖ x ‖ ) {\\textstyle \\varphi (\\mathbf {x} )={\\hat {\\varphi }}(\\left\\|\\mathbf {x} \\right\\|)} is a radial function. The distance is usually Euclidean distance, although other metrics are sometimes used. They are often used as a collection { φ k } k {\\displaystyle \\{\\varphi _{k}\\}_{k}} which forms a basis for some function space of interest, hence the name.","image":"99015519246670af1cb5592e439ad64a27fb4830.svg","url":"Radial_basis_function"}
