{"title":"Stochastic approximation","summary":"Stochastic approximation methods are a family of iterative methods typically used for root-finding problems or for optimization problems. The recursive update rules of stochastic approximation methods can be used, among other things, for solving linear systems when the collected data is corrupted by noise, or for approximating extreme values of functions which cannot be computed directly, but only estimated via noisy observations.","image":"31cf543bfe9725aa8ce3f8ef4233e64a7823f531.svg","url":"Stochastic_approximation"}
