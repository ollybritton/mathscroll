{"title":"Contiguity (probability theory)","summary":"In probability theory, two sequences of probability measures are said to be contiguous if asymptotically they share the same support. Thus the notion of contiguity extends the concept of absolute continuity to the sequences of measures.","image":"36849432394e0c3aa0beb282f53a9b414b1e75a1.svg","url":"Contiguity_(probability_theory)"}
