{"title":"Kolmogorov equations","summary":"In probability theory, Kolmogorov equations, including Kolmogorov forward equations and Kolmogorov backward equations, characterize continuous-time Markov processes. In particular, they describe how the probability that a continuous-time Markov process is in a certain state changes over time.","image":"a7fb519902b392849b8caa01b42adb4b8c9a8a6d.svg","url":"Kolmogorov_equations"}
