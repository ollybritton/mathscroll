{"title":"Distributed minimum spanning tree","summary":"The distributed minimum spanning tree (MST) problem involves the construction of a minimum spanning tree by a distributed algorithm, in a network where nodes communicate by message passing. It is radically different from the classical sequential problem, although the most basic approach resembles Bor≈Øvka's algorithm. One important application of this problem is to find a tree that can be used for broadcasting. In particular, if the cost for a message to pass through an edge in a graph is significant, an MST can minimize the total cost for a source process to communicate with all the other processes in the network.","image":"Minimum_spanning_tree.svg.png.webp","url":"Distributed_minimum_spanning_tree"}
