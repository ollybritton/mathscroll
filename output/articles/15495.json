{"title":"Tangential and normal components","summary":"In mathematics, given a vector at a point on a curve, that vector can be decomposed uniquely as a sum of two vectors, one tangent to the curve, called the tangential component of the vector, and another one perpendicular to the curve, called the normal component of the vector. Similarly, a vector at a point on a surface can be broken down the same way.","image":"Surface_normal_tangent.svg.png.webp","url":"Tangential_and_normal_components"}
