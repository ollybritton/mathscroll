{"title":"Closed and exact differential forms","summary":"In mathematics, especially vector calculus and differential topology, a closed form is a differential form α whose exterior derivative is zero (dα = 0), and an exact form is a differential form, α, that is the exterior derivative of another differential form β.  Thus, an exact form is in the image of d, and a closed form is in the kernel of d.","image":"Irrotationalfield.svg.png.webp","url":"Closed_and_exact_differential_forms"}
