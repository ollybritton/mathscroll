{"title":"Quantum walk","summary":"Quantum walks are quantum analogues of classical random walks. In contrast to the classical random walk, where the walker occupies definite states and the randomness arises due to stochastic transitions between states, in quantum walks randomness arises through: (1) quantum superposition of states, (2) non-random, reversible unitary evolution and (3) collapse of the wave function due to state measurements.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Quantum_walk"}
