{"title":"Cramér–Wold theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Cramér–Wold theorem in measure theory states that a Borel probability measure on R k {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{k}} is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections. It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results. The theorem is named after Harald Cramér and Herman Ole Andreas Wold.","image":"1bcd8908c9fa46eb979ef7b67d1bb65eb3692cbb.svg","url":"Cramér–Wold_theorem"}
