{"title":"Unitary representation","summary":"In mathematics, a unitary representation of a group G is a linear representation π of G on a complex Hilbert space V such that π(g) is a unitary operator for every g ∈ G. The general theory is well-developed in case G is a locally compact (Hausdorff) topological group and the representations are strongly continuous.","image":"4f273d80b08bc10e9c568d013632e929eb57056d.svg","url":"Unitary_representation"}
