{"title":"Null hypothesis","summary":"In scientific research, the null hypothesis (often denoted H0)[1] is the claim that no relationship exists between two sets of data or variables being analyzed. The null hypothesis is that any experimentally observed difference is due to chance alone, and an underlying causative relationship does not exist, hence the term \"null\". In addition to the null hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis is also developed, which claims that a relationship does exist between two variables.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Null_hypothesis"}
