{"title":"Beta skeleton","summary":"In computational geometry and geometric graph theory, a β-skeleton or beta skeleton is an undirected graph defined from a set of points in the Euclidean plane. Two points p and q are connected by an edge whenever all the angles prq are sharper than a threshold determined from the numerical parameter β.","image":"Beta-skeleton.svg.png.webp","url":"Beta_skeleton"}
