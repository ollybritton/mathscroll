{"title":"Ars Magna (Cardano book)","summary":"The Ars Magna (The Great Art, 1545) is an important Latin-language book on algebra written by Gerolamo Cardano. It was first published in 1545 under the title Artis Magnae, Sive de Regulis Algebraicis Liber Unus (Book number one about The Great Art, or The Rules of Algebra). There was a second edition in Cardano's lifetime, published in 1570. It is considered[1] one of the three greatest scientific treatises of the early Renaissance, together with Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium and Vesalius' De humani corporis fabrica. The first editions of these three books were published within a two-year span (1543â€“1545).","image":"ArsMagna.jpg.webp","url":"Ars_Magna_(Cardano_book)"}
