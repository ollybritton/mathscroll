{"title":"Weil–Brezin Map","summary":"In mathematics, the Weil–Brezin map, named after André Weil[1] and Jonathan Brezin,[2] is a unitary transformation that maps a Schwartz function on the real line  to a smooth function  on the Heisenberg manifold. The Weil–Brezin map gives a geometric interpretation of the Fourier transform, the Plancherel theorem and the Poisson summation formula.[3][4][5] The image of Gaussian functions under the Weil–Brezin map are nil-theta functions, which are related to theta functions. The Weil–Brezin map is sometimes referred to as the Zak transform,[6] which is widely applied in the field of physics and signal processing; however, the Weil–Brezin Map is defined via Heisenberg group geometrically, whereas there is no direct geometric or group theoretic interpretation from the Zak transform.","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Weil–Brezin_Map"}
