{"title":"Kripke–Platek set theory with urelements","summary":"The Kripke–Platek set theory with urelements (KPU) is an axiom system for set theory with urelements, based on the traditional (urelement-free) Kripke–Platek set theory. It is considerably weaker than the (relatively) familiar system ZFU. The purpose of allowing urelements is to allow large or high-complexity objects (such as the set of all reals) to be included in the theory's transitive models without disrupting the usual well-ordering and recursion-theoretic properties of the constructible universe; KP is so weak that this is hard to do by traditional means.","image":"d9a3547ba2f3cc5cb4463473815f227092b4766a.svg","url":"Kripke–Platek_set_theory_with_urelements"}
