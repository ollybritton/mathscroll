{"title":"Dihedral group","summary":"In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon,[1][2] which includes rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Dihedral_group"}
