{"title":"Shear mapping","summary":"In plane geometry, a shear mapping is a linear map that displaces each point in a fixed direction, by an amount proportional to its signed distance from the line that is parallel to that direction and goes through the origin.[1]  This type of mapping is also called shear transformation, transvection, or just shearing.","image":"VerticalShear_m%3D1.25_(blue_and_red).svg.png.webp","url":"Shear_mapping"}
