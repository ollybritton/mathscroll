{"title":"Skein relation","summary":"Skein relations are a mathematical tool used to study knots. A central question in the mathematical theory of knots is whether two knot diagrams represent the same knot. One way to answer the question is using knot polynomials, which are invariants of the knot. If two diagrams have different polynomials, they represent different knots. In general, the converse does not hold.","image":"Skein-relation-patches.png.webp","url":"Skein_relation"}
