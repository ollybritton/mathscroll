{"title":"Extension by definitions","summary":"In mathematical logic, more specifically in the proof theory of first-order theories, extensions by definitions formalize the introduction of new symbols by means of a definition. For example, it is common in naive set theory to introduce a symbol ∅ {\\displaystyle \\emptyset } for the set that has no member. In the formal setting of first-order theories, this can be done by adding to the theory a new constant ∅ {\\displaystyle \\emptyset } and the new axiom ∀ x ( x ∉ ∅ ) {\\displaystyle \\forall x(x\\notin \\emptyset )} , meaning \"for all x, x is not a member of ∅ {\\displaystyle \\emptyset } \". It can then be proved that doing so adds essentially nothing to the old theory, as should be expected from a definition. More precisely, the new theory is a conservative extension of the old one.","image":"6af50205f42bb2ec3c666b7b847d2c7f96e464c7.svg","url":"Extension_by_definitions"}
