{"title":"Stein's method","summary":"Stein's method is a general method in probability theory to obtain bounds on the distance between two probability distributions with respect to a probability metric. It was introduced by Charles Stein, who first published it in 1972,[1] to obtain a bound between the distribution of a sum of m {\\displaystyle m} -dependent sequence of random variables and a standard normal distribution in the Kolmogorov (uniform) metric and hence to prove not only a central limit theorem, but also bounds on the rates of convergence for the given metric.","image":"0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc.svg","url":"Stein's_method"}
