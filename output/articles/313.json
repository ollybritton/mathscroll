{"title":"Abundance conjecture","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the abundance conjecture is a conjecture in birational geometry, more precisely in the minimal model program, stating that for every projective variety X {\\displaystyle X} with Kawamata log terminal singularities over a field k {\\displaystyle k} if the canonical bundle K X {\\displaystyle K_{X}} is nef, then K X {\\displaystyle K_{X}} is semi-ample.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Abundance_conjecture"}
