{"title":"Finiteness properties of groups","summary":"In mathematics, finiteness properties of a group are a collection of properties that allow the use of various algebraic and topological tools, for example group cohomology, to study the group. It is mostly of interest for the study of infinite groups.","image":"4cfde86a3f7ec967af9955d0988592f0693d2b19.svg","url":"Finiteness_properties_of_groups"}
