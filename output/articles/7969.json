{"title":"Intuitionistic logic","summary":"Intuitionistic logic, sometimes more generally called constructive logic, refers to systems of symbolic logic that differ from the systems used for classical logic by more closely mirroring the notion of constructive proof. In particular, systems of intuitionistic logic do not assume the law of the excluded middle and double negation elimination, which are fundamental inference rules in classical logic.","image":"02ccf58345b8b31d226065b4f07a6476b0ecc22e.svg","url":"Intuitionistic_logic"}
