{"title":"Berezinian","summary":"In mathematics and theoretical physics, the Berezinian or superdeterminant is a generalization of the determinant to the case of supermatrices. The name is for Felix Berezin. The Berezinian plays a role analogous to the determinant when considering coordinate changes for integration on a supermanifold.","image":"8847b1451a691d881faf6524f49808cc0781ca7e.svg","url":"Berezinian"}
