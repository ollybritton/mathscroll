{"title":"p-FEM","summary":"p-FEM or the p-version of the finite element method is a numerical method for solving partial differential equations. It is a discretization strategy in which the finite element mesh is fixed and the polynomial degrees of elements are increased such that the lowest polynomial degree, denoted by p min {\\displaystyle p_{\\min }} , approaches infinity. This is in contrast with the \"h-version\" or \"h-FEM\", a widely used discretization strategy, in which the polynomial degrees of elements are fixed and the mesh is refined such that the diameter of the largest element, denoted by h max {\\displaystyle h_{\\max }} approaches zero.","image":"60561798077ce041023f628b96755904296ea081.svg","url":"P-FEM"}
