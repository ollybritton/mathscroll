{"title":"Weierstrass functions","summary":"In mathematics, the Weierstrass functions are special functions of a complex variable that are auxiliary to the Weierstrass elliptic function.  They are named for Karl Weierstrass. The relation between the sigma, zeta, and â„˜ {\\displaystyle \\wp } functions is analogous to that between the sine, cotangent, and squared cosecant functions: the logarithmic derivative of the sine is the cotangent, whose derivative is negative the squared cosecant.","image":"f4050ebf63686af152bf1ef5caabcdf2a2d812cf.svg","url":"Weierstrass_functions"}
