{"title":"Pushforward (differential)","summary":"In differential geometry, pushforward is a linear approximation of smooth maps on tangent spaces. Suppose that φ : M → N {\\displaystyle \\varphi :M\\to N} is a smooth map between smooth manifolds; then the differential of φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } at a point x {\\displaystyle x} , denoted d φ x {\\displaystyle d\\varphi _{x}} , is, in some sense, the best linear approximation of φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } near x {\\displaystyle x} . It can be viewed as a generalization of the total derivative of ordinary calculus. Explicitly, the differential is a linear map from the tangent space of M {\\displaystyle M} at x {\\displaystyle x} to the tangent space of N {\\displaystyle N} at φ ( x ) {\\displaystyle \\varphi (x)} , d φ x : T x M → T φ ( x ) N {\\displaystyle d\\varphi _{x}:T_{x}M\\to T_{\\varphi (x)}N} . Hence it can be used to push tangent vectors on M {\\displaystyle M} forward to tangent vectors on N {\\displaystyle N} . The differential of a map φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } is also called, by various authors, the derivative or total derivative of φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } .","image":"d7dd52f475d4d090b5f59f745e773f63d3176a01.svg","url":"Pushforward_(differential)"}
