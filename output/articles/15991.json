{"title":"Transversality (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, transversality is a notion that describes how spaces can intersect; transversality can be seen as the \"opposite\" of tangency, and plays a role in general position. It formalizes the idea of a generic intersection in differential topology. It is defined by considering the linearizations of the intersecting spaces at the points of intersection.","image":"Sphere-transverse.svg.png.webp","url":"Transversality_(mathematics)"}
