{"title":"E6 (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, E6 is the name of some closely related Lie groups, linear algebraic groups or their Lie algebras e 6 {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {e}}_{6}} , all of which have dimension 78; the same notation E6 is used for the corresponding root lattice, which has rank 6.  The designation E6 comes from the Cartan–Killing classification of the complex simple Lie algebras (see Élie Cartan § Work). This classifies Lie algebras into four infinite series labeled An, Bn, Cn, Dn, and five exceptional cases labeled E6, E7, E8, F4, and G2. The E6 algebra is thus one of the five exceptional cases.","image":"f5f478652f321cdcdc6a3a0185a7beac54022adb.svg","url":"E6_(mathematics)"}
