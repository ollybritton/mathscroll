{"title":"Homeomorphism group","summary":"In mathematics, particularly topology, the homeomorphism group of a topological space is the group consisting of all homeomorphisms from the space to itself with function composition as the group operation. Homeomorphism groups are very important in the theory of topological spaces and in general are examples of automorphism groups. Homeomorphism groups are topological invariants in the sense that the homeomorphism groups of homeomorphic topological spaces are isomorphic as groups.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Homeomorphism_group"}
