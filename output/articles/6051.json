{"title":"Generality of algebra","summary":"In the history of mathematics, the generality of algebra was a phrase used by Augustin-Louis Cauchy to describe a method of argument that was used in the 18th century by mathematicians such as Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange,[1] particularly in manipulating infinite series. According to Koetsier,[2] the generality of algebra principle assumed, roughly, that the algebraic rules that hold for a certain class of expressions can be extended to hold more generally on a larger class of objects, even if the rules are no longer obviously valid.  As a consequence, 18th century mathematicians believed that they could derive meaningful results by applying the usual rules of algebra and calculus that hold for finite expansions even when manipulating infinite expansions.","image":"2b932094beb48a3b4ebd67348a24df226311344b.svg","url":"Generality_of_algebra"}
