{"title":"Kuramoto model","summary":"The Kuramoto model (or Kuramoto–Daido model), first proposed by Yoshiki Kuramoto (蔵本 由紀, Kuramoto Yoshiki),[1][2] is a mathematical model used in describing synchronization. More specifically, it is a model for the behavior of a large set of coupled oscillators.[3][4] Its formulation was motivated by the behavior of systems of chemical and biological oscillators, and it has found widespread applications in areas such as neuroscience[5][6][7][8] and oscillating flame dynamics.[9][10] Kuramoto was quite surprised when the behavior of some physical systems, namely coupled arrays of Josephson junctions, followed his model.[11]","image":"e174c191a5ba3889c66597461ef260811cce0481.svg","url":"Kuramoto_model"}
