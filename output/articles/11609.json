{"title":"Orthorhombic crystal system","summary":"In crystallography, the orthorhombic crystal system is one of the 7 crystal systems. Orthorhombic lattices result from stretching a cubic lattice along two of its orthogonal pairs by two different factors, resulting in a rectangular prism with a rectangular base (a by b) and height (c), such that a, b, and c are distinct. All three bases intersect at 90Â° angles, so the three lattice vectors remain mutually orthogonal.","image":"Orthorhombic.svg.png.webp","url":"Orthorhombic_crystal_system"}
