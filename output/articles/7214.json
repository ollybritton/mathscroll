{"title":"Hilbert's Nullstellensatz","summary":"In mathematics, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (German for \"theorem of zeros,\" or more literally, \"zero-locus-theorem\") is a theorem that establishes a fundamental relationship between geometry and algebra. This relationship is the basis of algebraic geometry. It relates algebraic sets to ideals in polynomial rings over algebraically closed fields. This relationship was discovered by David Hilbert, who proved the Nullstellensatz in his second major paper on invariant theory in 1893 (following his seminal 1890 paper in which he proved Hilbert's basis theorem).","image":"ff472a050c05d0bbc73bd23888d3d654df28fbfb.svg","url":"Hilbert's_Nullstellensatz"}
