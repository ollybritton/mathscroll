{"title":"Plumbing (mathematics)","summary":"In  the mathematical field of geometric topology, among the techniques known as surgery theory, the process of plumbing is a way to create new manifolds out of disk bundles. It was first described by John Milnor[1] and subsequently used extensively in surgery theory to produce manifolds and normal maps with given surgery obstructions.","image":"fdc1863681033f062b6b2554b94998dfba5dd8d2.svg","url":"Plumbing_(mathematics)"}
