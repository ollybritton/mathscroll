{"title":"Poisson manifold","summary":"In differential geometry, a field in mathematics, a Poisson manifold is a smooth manifold endowed with a Poisson structure. The notion of Poisson manifold generalises that of symplectic manifold, which in turn generalises the phase space from Hamiltonian mechanics.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Poisson_manifold"}
