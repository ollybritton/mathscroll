{"title":"Bhāskara II","summary":"Bhāskara II (c. 1114–1185), also known as Bhāskarāchārya (\"Bhāskara, the teacher\"), and as Bhāskara II to avoid confusion with Bhāskara I, was an Indian mathematician and astronomer. From verses, in his main work, Siddhānta Shiromani (सिद्धांतशिरोमणी), it can be inferred that he was born in 1114 in Vijjadavida (Vijjalavida) and living in the Sahyadri mountain ranges of Western Ghats, believed to be the town of Patan in Chalisgaon, located in present-day Khandesh region of Maharashtra by scholars.[6] He is the only ancient mathematician who has been immortalized on a monument. In a temple in Maharashtra, an inscription supposedly created by his grandson Changadeva, lists Bhaskaracharya's ancestral lineage for several generations before him as well as two generations after him.[7][8] Colebrooke who was the first European to translate (1817) Bhaskaracharya II's  mathematical classics refers to the family as Maharashtrian Brahmins residing on the banks of the Godavari.[9]","image":"Teorema_de_Pitágoras.Bhaskara.svg.png.webp","url":"Bhāskara_II"}
