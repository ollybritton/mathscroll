{"title":"Pentagonal gyrobicupola","summary":"In geometry, the pentagonal gyrobicupola is one of the Johnson solids (J31). Like the pentagonal orthobicupola (J30), it can be obtained by joining two pentagonal cupolae (J5) along their bases. The difference is that in this solid, the two halves are rotated 36 degrees with respect to one another.","image":"Pentagonal_gyrobicupola.png.webp","url":"Pentagonal_gyrobicupola"}
