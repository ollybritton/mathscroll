{"title":"Graph power","summary":"In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, the kth power Gk of an undirected graph G is another graph that has the same set of vertices, but in which two vertices are adjacent when their distance in G is at mostÂ k. Powers of graphs are referred to using terminology similar to that of exponentiation of numbers: G2 is called the square of G, G3 is called the cube of G, etc.[1]","image":"Square_of_a_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Graph_power"}
