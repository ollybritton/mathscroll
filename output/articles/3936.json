{"title":"Deltahedron","summary":"In geometry, a deltahedron (plural deltahedra) is a polyhedron whose faces are all equilateral triangles. The name is taken from the Greek upper case delta (Î”), which has the shape of an equilateral triangle. There are infinitely many deltahedra, all having an even number of faces by the handshaking lemma. Of these only eight are convex, having 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 20 faces.[1] The number of faces, edges, and vertices is listed below for each of the eight convex deltahedra.","image":"Icosahedron.jpg.webp","url":"Deltahedron"}
