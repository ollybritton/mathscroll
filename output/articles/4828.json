{"title":"Endomorphism","summary":"In mathematics, an endomorphism is a morphism from a mathematical object to itself.  An endomorphism that is also an isomorphism is an automorphism. For example, an endomorphism of a vector space V is a linear map f: V → V, and an endomorphism of a group G is a group homomorphism f: G → G. In general, we can talk about endomorphisms in any category. In the category of sets, endomorphisms are functions from a set S to itself.","image":"Orthogonal_projection.svg.png.webp","url":"Endomorphism"}
