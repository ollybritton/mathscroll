{"title":"Hasse–Davenport relation","summary":"The Hasse–Davenport relations, introduced by Davenport and  Hasse (1935), are two related identities for Gauss sums, one called the Hasse–Davenport lifting relation, and the other called the Hasse–Davenport product relation. The Hasse–Davenport lifting relation is an equality in number theory relating Gauss sums over different fields. Weil (1949) used it to calculate the zeta function of a Fermat hypersurface over a finite field, which motivated the Weil conjectures.","image":"63cd81e6270c74ce9bc0b315f4a282878dd05acb.svg","url":"Hasse–Davenport_relation"}
