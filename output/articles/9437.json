Being invited to talk at an International Congress of Mathematicians has been called \"the equivalent, in this community, of an induction to a hall of fame.\"[1] The current list of Plenary and Invited Speakers presented here is based on the ICM's post-WW II terminology, in which the one-hour speakers in the morning sessions are called \"Plenary Speakers\" and the other speakers (in the afternoon sessions) whose talks are included in the ICM published proceedings are called \"Invited Speakers\". In the pre-WW II congresses the Plenary Speakers were called \"Invited Speakers\".","image":"Felix_Klein.jpeg.webp","url":"List_of_International_Congresses_of_Mathematicians_Plenary_and_Invited_Speakers"}
