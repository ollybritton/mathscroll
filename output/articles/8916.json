It was founded in 1899 jointly by Henri Fehr from Geneva and by Charles-Ange Laisant from Paris as co-editors-in-chief. When Laisant died in 1920, Adolphe Buhl replaced him as co-editor-in-chief. Buhl died in 1949 and Fehr died in 1954 — since then the journal has been affiliated with the University of Geneva.
