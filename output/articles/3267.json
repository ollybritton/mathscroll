{"title":"Constant curvature","summary":"In mathematics, constant curvature is a concept from differential geometry. Here, curvature refers to the sectional curvature of a space (more precisely a manifold) and is a single number determining its local geometry. The sectional curvature is said to be constant if it has the same value at every point and for every two-dimensional tangent plane at that point. For example, a sphere is a surface of constant positive curvature.","image":"93b804c626f8e71a72ed80910898e9bbc173353f.svg","url":"Constant_curvature"}
