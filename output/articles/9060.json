{"title":"Lattice graph","summary":"In graph theory, a lattice graph, mesh graph, or grid graph is a graph whose drawing, embedded in some Euclidean space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} , forms a regular tiling. This implies that the group of bijective transformations that send the graph to itself is a lattice in the group-theoretical sense.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Lattice_graph"}
