{"title":"Vampire number","summary":"In number theory, a vampire number (or true vampire number) is a composite natural number with an even number of digits, that can be factored into two natural numbers each with half as many digits as the original number, where the two factors contain precisely all the digits of the original number, in any order, counting multiplicity. The two factors cannot both have trailing zeroes. The first vampire number is 1260 = 21 Ã— 60.[1][2]","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Vampire_number"}
