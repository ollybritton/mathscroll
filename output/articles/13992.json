{"title":"Schur–Zassenhaus theorem","summary":"The Schur–Zassenhaus theorem is a theorem in group theory which states that if G {\\displaystyle G} is a finite group, and N {\\displaystyle N} is a normal subgroup whose order is coprime to the order of the quotient group G / N {\\displaystyle G/N} , then G {\\displaystyle G} is a semidirect product (or split extension) of N {\\displaystyle N} and G / N {\\displaystyle G/N} . An alternative statement of the theorem is that any normal Hall subgroup N {\\displaystyle N} of a finite group G {\\displaystyle G} has a complement in G {\\displaystyle G} . Moreover if either N {\\displaystyle N} or G / N {\\displaystyle G/N} is solvable then the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem also states  that all complements of N {\\displaystyle N} in G {\\displaystyle G} are conjugate. The assumption that either N {\\displaystyle N} or G / N {\\displaystyle G/N} is solvable can be dropped as it is always satisfied, but all known proofs of this require the use of the much harder Feit–Thompson theorem.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Schur–Zassenhaus_theorem"}
