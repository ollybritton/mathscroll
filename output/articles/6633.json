{"title":"Group testing","summary":"In statistics and combinatorial mathematics, group testing is any procedure that breaks up the task of identifying certain objects into tests on groups of items, rather than on individual ones. First studied by Robert Dorfman in 1943, group testing is a relatively new field of applied mathematics that can be applied to a wide range of practical applications and is an active area of research today.","image":"Group_testing_lightbulbs.svg.png.webp","url":"Group_testing"}
