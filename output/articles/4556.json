{"title":"Dyson's transform","summary":"Dyson's transform is a fundamental technique in additive number theory.[1] It was developed by Freeman Dyson as part of his proof of Mann's theorem,[2]: 17  is used to prove such fundamental results of Additive Number Theory as the Cauchy-Davenport theorem,[1] and was used by Olivier Ramaré in his work on the Goldbach conjecture that proved that every even integer is the sum of at most 6 primes.[3]: 700–701  The term Dyson's transform for this technique is used by Ramaré.[3]: 700–701  Halberstam and Roth call it the τ-transformation.[2]: 58","image":"Freeman_Dyson.jpg.webp","url":"Dyson's_transform"}
