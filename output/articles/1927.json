{"title":"Braid group","summary":"In mathematics, the braid group on n strands (denoted B n {\\displaystyle B_{n}} ), also known as the Artin braid group,[1] is the group whose elements are equivalence classes of n-braids (e.g. under ambient isotopy), and whose group operation is composition of braids (see § Introduction). Example applications of braid groups include knot theory, where any knot may be represented as the closure of certain braids (a result known as Alexander's theorem); in mathematical physics where Artin's canonical presentation of the braid group corresponds to the Yang–Baxter equation (see § Basic properties); and in monodromy invariants of algebraic geometry.[2]","image":"2f568bf6d34e97b9fdda0dc7e276d6c4501d2045.svg","url":"Braid_group"}
