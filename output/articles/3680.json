{"title":"Cycle index","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics a cycle index is a polynomial in several variables which is structured in such a way that information about how a group of permutations acts on a set can be simply read off from the coefficients and exponents. This compact way of storing information in an algebraic form is frequently used in combinatorial enumeration.","image":"4f4a442195b3cfc630b7e01cbee1f22894824988.svg","url":"Cycle_index"}
