{"title":"Highly composite number","summary":"A highly composite number is a positive integer with more divisors than any smaller positive integer has. A related concept is that of a largely composite number, a positive integer which has at least as many divisors as any smaller positive integer. The name can be somewhat misleading, as the first two highly composite numbers (1 and 2) are not actually composite numbers; however, all further terms are.","image":"Highly_composite_number_Cuisenaire_rods_6.png.webp","url":"Highly_composite_number"}
