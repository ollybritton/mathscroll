{"title":"MOEA Framework","summary":"The MOEA Framework is an open-source evolutionary computation library for Java that specializes in multi-objective optimization.  It supports a variety of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, differential evolution, and particle swarm optimization.  As a result, it has been used to conduct numerous comparative studies to assess the efficiency, reliability, and controllability of state-of-the-art MOEAs.","image":"MOEA_Framework_Logo.png.webp","url":"MOEA_Framework"}
