{"title":"cis (mathematics)","summary":"cis is a mathematical notation defined by cis x = cos x + i sin x, where cos is the cosine function, i is the imaginary unit and sin is the sine function. The notation is less commonly used in mathematics than Euler's formula, eix, which offers an even shorter notation for cos x + i sin x, but cis(x) is widely used as a name for this function in software libraries.","image":"aab1fcd1a6db5cc6678bb9cbd871580eeeb86eda.svg","url":"Cis_(mathematics)"}
