{"title":"Continuous q-Hahn polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the continuous q-Hahn polynomials  are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme. Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties.","image":"9bdb7cc0b89b1774946a2593688f89baa8ceb6ae.svg","url":"Continuous_q-Hahn_polynomials"}
