{"title":"Algorism","summary":"Algorism is the technique of performing basic arithmetic by writing numbers in place value form and applying a set of memorized rules and facts to the digits. One who practices algorism is known as an algorist. This positional notation system has largely superseded earlier calculation systems that used a different set of symbols for each numerical magnitude, such as Roman numerals, and in some cases required a device such as an abacus.","image":"Gregor_Reisch%2C_Margarita_Philosophica%2C_1508_(1230x1615).png.webp","url":"Algorism"}
