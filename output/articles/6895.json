{"title":"Harish-Chandra isomorphism","summary":"In mathematics, the Harish-Chandra isomorphism, introduced by Harish-ChandraÂ (1951), is an isomorphism of commutative rings constructed in the theory of Lie algebras. The isomorphism maps the center Z ( U ( g ) ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {Z}}(U({\\mathfrak {g}}))} of the universal enveloping algebra U ( g ) {\\displaystyle U({\\mathfrak {g}})} of a reductive Lie algebra g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} to the elements S ( h ) W {\\displaystyle S({\\mathfrak {h}})^{W}} of the symmetric algebra S ( h ) {\\displaystyle S({\\mathfrak {h}})} of a Cartan subalgebra h {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {h}}} that are invariant under the Weyl group W {\\displaystyle W} .","image":"9dbbf009e4f6b83b6f074666d14ca559fa238eaf.svg","url":"Harish-Chandra_isomorphism"}
