{"title":"Sub-Riemannian manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a sub-Riemannian manifold is a certain type of generalization of a Riemannian manifold. Roughly speaking, to measure distances in a sub-Riemannian manifold, you are allowed to go only along curves tangent to so-called horizontal subspaces.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Sub-Riemannian_manifold"}
