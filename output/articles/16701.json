{"title":"W-algebra","summary":"In conformal field theory and representation theory, a W-algebra is an associative algebra that generalizes the Virasoro algebra. W-algebras were introduced by Alexander Zamolodchikov,[1] and the name \"W-algebra\" comes from the fact that Zamolodchikov used the letter W for one of the elements of one of his examples.","image":"8e8cddb51aa2e8b86144a27caede9aff388100de.svg","url":"W-algebra"}
