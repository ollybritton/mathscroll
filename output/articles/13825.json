{"title":"s-finite measure","summary":"In measure theory, a branch of mathematics that studies generalized notions of volumes, an s-finite measure is a special type of measure. An s-finite measure is more general than a finite measure, but allows one to generalize certain proofs for finite measures.","image":"0297c24d37da698d6c360440dd83c2f60a1ce3b6.svg","url":"S-finite_measure"}
