{"title":"Anamorphic stretch transform","summary":"An anamorphic stretch transform (AST) also referred to as warped stretch transform is a physics-inspired signal transform that emerged from time stretch dispersive Fourier transform. The transform can be applied to analog temporal signals such as communication signals, or to digital spatial data such as images.[1][2] The transform reshapes the data in such a way that its output has properties conducive for data compression and analytics. The reshaping consists of warped stretching in the Fourier domain. The name \"Anamorphic\" is used because of the metaphoric analogy between the warped stretch operation and warping of images in anamorphosis[3] and surrealist artworks.[4]","image":"c07048bd3824291a30622d649c0f02e95f214a6e.svg","url":"Anamorphic_stretch_transform"}
