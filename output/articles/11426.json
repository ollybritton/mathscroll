{"title":"Open set condition","summary":"In fractal geometry, the open set condition (OSC) is a commonly imposed condition on self-similar fractals. In some sense, the condition imposes restrictions on the overlap in a fractal construction.[1] Specifically, given an iterated function system of  contractive mappings ψ 1 , … , ψ m {\\displaystyle \\psi _{1},\\ldots ,\\psi _{m}} , the open set condition requires that there exists a nonempty, open set V satisfying two conditions:","image":"adb486a2ee9cba30a8eaa589eac17a5b51bbfc9f.svg","url":"Open_set_condition"}
