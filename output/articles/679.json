{"title":"Alphabet (formal languages)","summary":"In formal language theory, an alphabet is a non-empty set of symbols/glyphs, typically thought of as representing letters, characters, or digits[1] but among other possibilities the \"symbols\" could also be a set of phonemes (sound units). Alphabets in this technical sense of a set are used in a diverse range of fields including logic, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics. An alphabet may have any cardinality (\"size\") and depending on its purpose maybe be finite (e.g., the alphabet of letters \"a\" through \"z\"), countable (e.g., { v 1 , v 2 , … } {\\displaystyle \\{v_{1},v_{2},\\ldots \\}} ), or even uncountable (e.g., { v x : x ∈ R } {\\displaystyle \\{v_{x}:x\\in \\mathbb {R} \\}} ).","image":"7dc0ed3253fa6c9140d02edcbe511d218a73a3e5.svg","url":"Alphabet_(formal_languages)"}
