{"title":"Section (category theory)","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a section is a right inverse of some morphism. Dually, a retraction is a left inverse of some morphism. In other words, if f : X → Y {\\displaystyle f:X\\to Y} and g : Y → X {\\displaystyle g:Y\\to X} are morphisms whose composition f ∘ g : Y → Y {\\displaystyle f\\circ g:Y\\to Y} is the identity morphism on Y {\\displaystyle Y} , then g {\\displaystyle g} is a section of f {\\displaystyle f} , and f {\\displaystyle f} is a retraction of g {\\displaystyle g} .[1]","image":"abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c.svg","url":"Section_(category_theory)"}
