{"title":"Gyroelongated bicupola","summary":"In geometry, the gyroelongated bicupolae are an infinite sets of polyhedra, constructed by adjoining two n-gonal cupolas to an n-gonal Antiprism. The triangular, square, and pentagonal gyroelongated bicupola are three of five Johnson solids which are chiral, meaning that they have a \"left-handed\" and a \"right-handed\" form.","image":"Gyroelongated_pentagonal_bicupola.png.webp","url":"Gyroelongated_bicupola"}
