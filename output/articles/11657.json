{"title":"Oval","summary":"An oval (from Latin  ovumÂ 'egg') is a closed curve in a plane which resembles the outline of an egg. The term is not very specific, but in some areas (projective geometry, technical drawing, etc.) it is given a more precise definition, which may include either one or two axes of symmetry of an ellipse. In common English, the term is used in a broader sense: any shape which reminds one of an egg. The three-dimensional version of an oval is called an ovoid.","image":"Oval1.svg.png.webp","url":"Oval"}
