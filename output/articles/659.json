{"title":"Almost complex manifold","summary":"In mathematics, an almost complex manifold is a smooth manifold equipped with a smooth linear complex structure on each tangent space. Every complex manifold is an almost complex manifold, but there are almost complex manifolds that are not complex manifolds. Almost complex structures have important applications in symplectic geometry.","image":"82d2bb45f5120f5c885585143e126eb044268126.svg","url":"Almost_complex_manifold"}
