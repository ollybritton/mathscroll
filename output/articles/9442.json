{"title":"List of Laplace transforms","summary":"The following is a list of Laplace transforms for many common functions of a single variable.[1] The Laplace transform is an integral transform that takes a function of a positive real variable t (often time) to a function of a complex variable s (frequency).","image":"5bf044fe2fbfc4bd8d6d7230f4108430263f9fd6.svg","url":"List_of_Laplace_transforms"}
