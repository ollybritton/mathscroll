{"title":"Telegraph process","summary":"In probability theory, the telegraph process is a memoryless continuous-time stochastic process that shows two distinct values. It models burst noise (also called popcorn noise or random telegraph signal). If the two possible values that a random variable can take are c 1 {\\displaystyle c_{1}} and c 2 {\\displaystyle c_{2}} , then the process can be described by the following master equations:","image":"77b7dc6d279091d354e0b90889b463bfa7eb7247.svg","url":"Telegraph_process"}
