{"title":"Mathematical joke","summary":"A mathematical joke is a form of humor which relies on aspects of mathematics or a stereotype of mathematicians. The humor may come from a pun, or from a double meaning of a mathematical term, or from a lay person's misunderstanding of a mathematical concept. Mathematician and author John Allen Paulos in his book Mathematics and Humor described several ways that mathematics, generally considered a dry, formal activity, overlaps with humor, a loose, irreverent activity: both are forms of \"intellectual play\"; both have \"logic, pattern, rules, structure\"; and both are \"economical and explicit\".[2]","image":"Volume_of_a_pizza.svg.png.webp","url":"Mathematical_joke"}
