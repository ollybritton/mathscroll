{"title":"Combinatorics on words","summary":"Combinatorics on words is a fairly new field of mathematics, branching from combinatorics, which focuses on the study of words and formal languages.  The subject looks at letters or symbols, and the sequences they form.  Combinatorics on words affects various areas of mathematical study, including algebra and computer science.  There have been a wide range of contributions to the field.  Some of the first work was on square-free words by Axel Thue in the early 1900s.  He and colleagues observed patterns within words and tried to explain them.  As time went on, combinatorics on words became useful in the study of algorithms and coding.  It led to developments in abstract algebra and answering open questions.","image":"Morse-Thue_sequence.gif","url":"Combinatorics_on_words"}
