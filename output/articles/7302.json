{"title":"History of quaternions","summary":"In mathematics, quaternions are a non-commutative number system that extends the complex numbers. Quaternions and their applications to rotations were first described in print by Olinde Rodrigues in all but name in 1840,[1] but independently discovered by Irish mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton in 1843 and applied to mechanics in three-dimensional space. They find uses in both theoretical and applied mathematics, in particular for calculations involving three-dimensional rotations.","image":"Inscription_on_Broom_Bridge_(Dublin)_regarding_the_discovery_of_Quaternions_multiplication_by_Sir_William_Rowan_Hamilton.jpg.webp","url":"History_of_quaternions"}
