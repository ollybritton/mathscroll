{"title":"Residue (complex analysis)","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically complex analysis, the residue is a complex number proportional to the contour integral of a meromorphic function along a path enclosing one of its singularities. (More generally, residues can be calculated for any function f : C ∖ { a k } k → C {\\displaystyle f\\colon \\mathbb {C} \\setminus \\{a_{k}\\}_{k}\\rightarrow \\mathbb {C} } that is holomorphic except at the discrete points {ak}k, even if some of them are essential singularities.) Residues can be computed quite easily and, once known, allow the determination of general contour integrals via the residue theorem.","image":"24265b74a9fd05d00f5f9592113321eb8436f17b.svg","url":"Residue_(complex_analysis)"}
