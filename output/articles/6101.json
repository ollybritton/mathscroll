{"title":"Generator (category theory)","summary":"In mathematics, specifically category theory, a family of generators (or family of separators) of a category C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} is a collection G ⊆ O b ( C ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {G}}\\subseteq Ob({\\mathcal {C}})} of objects in C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} , such that for any two distinct morphisms f , g : X → Y {\\displaystyle f,g:X\\to Y} in C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} , that is with f ≠ g {\\displaystyle f\\neq g} , there is some G {\\displaystyle G} in G {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {G}}} and some morphism h : G → X {\\displaystyle h:G\\to X} such that f ∘ h ≠ g ∘ h . {\\displaystyle f\\circ h\\neq g\\circ h.} If the collection consists of a single object G {\\displaystyle G} , we say it is a generator (or separator).","image":"e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019.svg","url":"Generator_(category_theory)"}
