{"title":"Linear regression","summary":"In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.[1] This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.[2]","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Linear_regression"}
