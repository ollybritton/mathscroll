{"title":"Polar decomposition","summary":"In mathematics, the polar decomposition of a square real or complex matrix A {\\displaystyle A} is a factorization of the form A = U P {\\displaystyle A=UP} , where U {\\displaystyle U} is an orthogonal matrix and P {\\displaystyle P} is a positive semi-definite symmetric matrix ( U {\\displaystyle U} is a unitary matrix and P {\\displaystyle P} is a positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix in the complex case), both square and of the same size.[1]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Polar_decomposition"}
