{"title":"Isolating neighborhood","summary":"In the theory of dynamical systems, an isolating neighborhood is a compact set in the phase space of an invertible dynamical system with the property that any orbit contained entirely in the set belongs to its interior. This is a basic notion in the Conley index theory. Its variant for non-invertible systems is used in formulating a precise mathematical definition of an attractor.","image":"e418d57b3d2104300e02486fb8386d4aefe2fb6f.svg","url":"Isolating_neighborhood"}
