{"title":"Constraint inference","summary":"In constraint satisfaction, constraint inference is a relationship between constraints and their consequences. A set of constraints D {\\displaystyle D} entails a constraint C {\\displaystyle C} if every solution to D {\\displaystyle D} is also a solution to C {\\displaystyle C} . In other words, if V {\\displaystyle V} is a valuation of the variables in the scopes of the constraints in D {\\displaystyle D} and all constraints in D {\\displaystyle D} are satisfied by V {\\displaystyle V} , then V {\\displaystyle V} also satisfies the constraint C {\\displaystyle C} .","image":"f34a0c600395e5d4345287e21fb26efd386990e6.svg","url":"Constraint_inference"}
