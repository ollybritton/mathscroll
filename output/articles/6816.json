{"title":"Hall's conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, Hall's conjecture is an open question, as of 2015, on the differences between perfect squares and perfect cubes. It asserts that a perfect square y2 and a perfect cube x3 that are not equal must lie a substantial distance apart. This question arose from consideration of the Mordell equation in the theory of integer points on elliptic curves.","image":"4d7c1d0aa554d5888de507570ac70e74570889da.svg","url":"Hall's_conjecture"}
