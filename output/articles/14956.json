{"title":"Stationary point","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in calculus,  a stationary point of a differentiable function of one variable is a point on the graph of the function where the function's derivative is zero.[1][2][3] Informally, it is a point where the function \"stops\" increasing or decreasing (hence the name).","image":"Stationary_vs_inflection_pts.svg.png.webp","url":"Stationary_point"}
