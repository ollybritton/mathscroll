{"title":"2-bridge knot","summary":"In the mathematical field of knot theory, a 2-bridge knot is a knot which can be regular isotoped so that the natural height function given by the z-coordinate has only two maxima and two minima as critical points. Equivalently, these are the knots with bridge number 2, the smallest possible bridge number for a nontrivial knot.","image":"2-bridge-knot.jpg.webp","url":"2-bridge_knot"}
