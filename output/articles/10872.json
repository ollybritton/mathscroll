{"title":"Möbius ladder","summary":"In graph theory, the Möbius ladder Mn, for even numbers n, is formed from an n-cycle by adding edges (called \"rungs\") connecting opposite pairs of vertices in the cycle. It is a cubic, circulant graph, so-named because (with the exception of M6 (the utility graph K3,3), Mn has exactly n/2 four-cycles[1] which link together by their shared edges to form a topological Möbius strip. Möbius ladders were named and first studied by Guy and  Harary (1967).","image":"Moebius_ladder_colour.svg.png.webp","url":"Möbius_ladder"}
