{"title":"Linear recurrence with constant coefficients","summary":"In mathematics (including combinatorics, linear algebra, and dynamical systems), a linear recurrence with constant coefficients[1]: ch. 17 [2]: ch. 10  (also known as a linear recurrence relation or linear difference equation) sets equal to 0 a polynomial that is linear in the various iterates of a variable—that is, in the values of the elements of a sequence. The polynomial's linearity means that each of its terms has degree 0 or 1. A linear recurrence denotes the evolution of some variable over time, with the current time period or discrete moment in time denoted as t, one period earlier denoted as t − 1, one period later as t + 1, etc.","image":"341a2d12ce92e3fea7d84164718915a07861be18.svg","url":"Linear_recurrence_with_constant_coefficients"}
