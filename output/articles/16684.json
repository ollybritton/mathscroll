{"title":"Von Neumann bicommutant theorem","summary":"In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, the von Neumann bicommutant theorem relates the closure of a set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space in certain topologies to the bicommutant of that set. In essence, it is a connection between the algebraic and topological sides of operator theory.","image":"abbe59d144438944b6f8879b81a8cfab4ec8c40d.svg","url":"Von_Neumann_bicommutant_theorem"}
