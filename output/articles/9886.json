{"title":"Malliavin calculus","summary":"In probability theory and related fields, Malliavin calculus is a set of mathematical techniques and ideas that extend the mathematical field of calculus of variations from  deterministic functions to stochastic processes. In particular, it allows the computation of derivatives of random variables. Malliavin calculus is also called the stochastic calculus of variations. P. Malliavin first initiated the calculus on infinite dimensional space. Then, the significant contributors such as S. Kusuoka, D. Stroock, Bismut, S. Watanabe, I. Shigekawa, and so on finally completed the foundations.","image":"32e8566d3cd6e6a0dc523259efd3f28c95c0785f.svg","url":"Malliavin_calculus"}
