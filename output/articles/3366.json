{"title":"Convergence of Fourier series","summary":"In mathematics, the question of whether the Fourier series of a periodic function converges to a given function is researched by a field known as classical harmonic analysis, a branch of pure mathematics. Convergence is not necessarily given in the general case, and certain criteria must be met for convergence to occur.","image":"dcbd99c1d4c40b9ec9b6ff640ee2d48f16a92e07.svg","url":"Convergence_of_Fourier_series"}
