{"title":"Eternity puzzle","summary":"The Eternity puzzle is a tiling puzzle created by Christopher Monckton and launched by the Ertl Company in June 1999. It was marketed as being practically unsolvable, with a Â£1 million prize on offer for whoever could solve it within four years. The prize was paid out in October 2000 for a winning solution arrived at by two mathematicians from Cambridge.[1] A follow-up prize puzzle called Eternity II was launched in 2007.[2]","image":"Eternity_puzzle_board.svg.png.webp","url":"Eternity_puzzle"}
