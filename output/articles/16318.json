{"title":"Umbilical point","summary":"In the differential geometry of surfaces in three dimensions, umbilics or umbilical points are points on a surface that are locally spherical. At such points the normal curvatures in all directions are equal, hence, both principal curvatures are equal, and every tangent vector is a principal direction. The name \"umbilic\" comes from the Latin umbilicus (navel).","image":"Ellipso-KL-NP.svg.png.webp","url":"Umbilical_point"}
