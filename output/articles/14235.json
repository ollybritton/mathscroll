{"title":"Seven states of randomness","summary":"The seven states of randomness in probability theory, fractals and risk analysis are extensions of the concept of randomness as modeled by the normal distribution. These seven states were first introduced by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in his 1997 book Fractals and Scaling in Finance, which applied fractal analysis to the study of risk and randomness.[1] This classification builds upon the three main states of randomness: mild, slow, and wild.","image":"Stable_motion_blue.jpeg.webp","url":"Seven_states_of_randomness"}
