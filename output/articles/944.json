{"title":"Archimedean ordered vector space","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory, a binary relation ≤ {\\displaystyle \\,\\leq \\,} on a vector space X {\\displaystyle X} over the real or complex numbers is called Archimedean if for all x ∈ X , {\\displaystyle x\\in X,} whenever there exists some y ∈ X {\\displaystyle y\\in X} such that n x ≤ y {\\displaystyle nx\\leq y} for all positive integers n , {\\displaystyle n,} then necessarily x ≤ 0. {\\displaystyle x\\leq 0.} An Archimedean (pre)ordered vector space is a (pre)ordered vector space whose order is Archimedean.[1] A preordered vector space X {\\displaystyle X} is called almost Archimedean if for all x ∈ X , {\\displaystyle x\\in X,} whenever there exists a y ∈ X {\\displaystyle y\\in X} such that − n − 1 y ≤ x ≤ n − 1 y {\\displaystyle -n^{-1}y\\leq x\\leq n^{-1}y} for all positive integers n , {\\displaystyle n,} then x = 0. {\\displaystyle x=0.} [2]","image":"24112548985eab096493f73f838580442780b57f.svg","url":"Archimedean_ordered_vector_space"}
