{"title":"Bigyrate diminished rhombicosidodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the bigyrate diminished rhombicosidodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (J79). It can be constructed as a rhombicosidodecahedron with two pentagonal cupolae rotated through 36 degrees, and a third pentagonal cupola removed. (None of the cupolae can be adjacent.)","image":"Bigyrate_diminished_rhombicosidodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Bigyrate_diminished_rhombicosidodecahedron"}
