{"title":"Inclusion order","summary":"In the mathematical field of order theory, an inclusion order is the partial order that arises as the subset-inclusion relation on some collection of objects.  In a simple way, every poset P = (X,≤) is (isomorphic to) an inclusion order (just as every group is isomorphic to a permutation group – see Cayley's theorem).  To see this, associate to each element x of X the set","image":"965450e01470d72a275c0975d09d17297b8720bf.svg","url":"Inclusion_order"}
