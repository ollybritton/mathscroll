{"title":"Spectral theory of normal C*-algebras","summary":"In functional analysis, every C*-algebra is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the C*-algebra B ( H ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}(H)} of bounded linear operators on some Hilbert space H . {\\displaystyle H.} This article describes the spectral theory of closed normal subalgebras of B ( H ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}(H)} . A subalgebra A {\\displaystyle A} of B ( H ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}(H)} is called normal if it is commutative and closed under the ∗ {\\displaystyle \\ast } operation: for all x , y ∈ A {\\displaystyle x,y\\in A} , we have x ∗ ∈ A {\\displaystyle x^{\\ast }\\in A} and that x y = y x {\\displaystyle xy=yx} .[1]","image":"ee5ed95a5cecd6e72f35817da447ec0cce79508a.svg","url":"Spectral_theory_of_normal_C*-algebras"}
