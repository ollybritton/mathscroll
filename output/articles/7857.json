{"title":"Integer factorization records","summary":"Integer factorization is the process of determining which prime numbers divide a given positive integer. Doing this quickly has applications in cryptography. The difficulty depends on both the size and form of the number and its prime factors; it is currently very difficult to factorize large semiprimes (and, indeed, most numbers which have no small factors).","image":"2c5ce9b9694c12dc0dbfed0af10747e49060f602.svg","url":"Integer_factorization_records"}
