{"title":"Khintchine inequality","summary":"In mathematics, the Khintchine inequality, named after Aleksandr Khinchin and spelled in multiple ways in the Latin alphabet, is a theorem from probability, and is also frequently used in analysis. Heuristically, it says that if we pick N {\\displaystyle N} complex numbers x 1 , … , x N ∈ C {\\displaystyle x_{1},\\dots ,x_{N}\\in \\mathbb {C} } , and add them together each multiplied by a random sign ± 1 {\\displaystyle \\pm 1} , then the expected value of the sum's modulus, or the modulus it will be closest to on average, will be not too far off from | x 1 | 2 + ⋯ + | x N | 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {|x_{1}|^{2}+\\cdots +|x_{N}|^{2}}}} .","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Khintchine_inequality"}
