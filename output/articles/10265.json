{"title":"Measurable cardinal","summary":"In mathematics, a measurable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number. In order to define the concept, one introduces a two-valued measure on a cardinal κ, or more generally on any set. For a cardinal κ, it can be described as a subdivision of all of its subsets into large and small sets such that κ itself is large, ∅ and all singletons {α}, α ∈ κ are small, complements of small sets are large and vice versa. The intersection of fewer than κ large sets is again large.[1]","image":"242c68467833c956c6679580d6114028ffc85c71.svg","url":"Measurable_cardinal"}
