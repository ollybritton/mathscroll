{"title":"Defective matrix","summary":"In linear algebra, a defective matrix is a square matrix that does not have a complete basis of eigenvectors, and is therefore not diagonalizable.  In particular, an n × n matrix is defective if and only if it does not have n linearly independent eigenvectors.[1]  A complete basis is formed by augmenting the eigenvectors with generalized eigenvectors, which are necessary for solving defective systems of ordinary differential equations and other problems.","image":"f8a0e3400ffb97d67c00267ed50cddfe824cbe80.svg","url":"Defective_matrix"}
