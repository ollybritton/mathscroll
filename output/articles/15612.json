{"title":"Tetrahedral-square tiling honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the tetrahedral-square tiling honeycomb is a paracompact uniform honeycomb, constructed from tetrahedron, cuboctahedron and  square tiling cells, in a rhombicuboctahedron vertex figure. It has a single-ring Coxeter diagram, , and is named by its two regular cells.","image":"CDel_node.png.webp","url":"Tetrahedral-square_tiling_honeycomb"}
