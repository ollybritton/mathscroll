{"title":"Approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebra","summary":"In mathematics, an approximately finite-dimensional (AF) C*-algebra is a C*-algebra that is the inductive limit of a sequence of finite-dimensional C*-algebras. Approximate finite-dimensionality was first defined and described combinatorially by Ola Bratteli. Later, George A. Elliott gave a complete classification of AF algebras using the K0 functor whose range consists of ordered abelian groups with sufficiently nice order structure.","image":"44bbef4b6e58e2f00dca1fc8666698773570a5a6.svg","url":"Approximately_finite-dimensional_C*-algebra"}
