{"title":"Uses of trigonometry","summary":"Amongst the lay public of non-mathematicians and non-scientists, trigonometry is known chiefly for its application to measurement problems, yet is also often used in ways that are far more subtle, such as its place in the theory of music; still other uses are more technical, such as in number theory. The mathematical topics of Fourier series and Fourier transforms rely heavily on knowledge of trigonometric functions and find application in a number of areas, including statistics.","image":"Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_1.svg.png.webp","url":"Uses_of_trigonometry"}
