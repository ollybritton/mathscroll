{"title":"Multiple (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a multiple is the product of any quantity and an integer.[1] In other words, for the quantities a and b, it can be said that b is a multiple of a if b = na for some integer n, which is called the multiplier. If a is not zero, this is equivalent to saying that b / a {\\displaystyle b/a} is an integer.","image":"0e0082708c4a962619f1b493a22dc776b5fbab62.svg","url":"Multiple_(mathematics)"}
