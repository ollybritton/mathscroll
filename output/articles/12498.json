{"title":"Primes in arithmetic progression","summary":"In number theory, primes in arithmetic progression are any sequence of at least three prime numbers that are consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression. An example is the sequence of primes (3, 7, 11), which is given by a n = 3 + 4 n {\\displaystyle a_{n}=3+4n} for 0 ≤ n ≤ 2 {\\displaystyle 0\\leq n\\leq 2} .","image":"04333cbb39efb64fdc27a9a5de0b051ddfc6edcb.svg","url":"Primes_in_arithmetic_progression"}
