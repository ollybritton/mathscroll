{"title":"Dense submodule","summary":"In abstract algebra, specifically in module theory, a dense submodule of a module is a refinement of the notion of an essential submodule.  If N is a dense submodule of M, it may alternatively be said that \"N ⊆ M is a rational extension\". Dense submodules are connected with rings of quotients in noncommutative ring theory. Most of the results appearing here were first established in (Johnson 1951), (Utumi 1956) and (Findlay & Lambek 1958).","image":"401609e5a2a80ff0ed0b3319a0c7a945a3230fdd.svg","url":"Dense_submodule"}
