{"title":"Benktander type II distribution","summary":"The Benktander type II distribution, also called the Benktander distribution of the second kind, is one of two distributions introduced by Gunnar BenktanderÂ (1970) to model heavy-tailed losses commonly found in non-life/casualty actuarial science, using various forms of mean excess functions (Benktander & Segerdahl 1960). This distribution is \"close\" to the Weibull distribution (Kleiber & Kotz 2003).","image":"Benktander2PDF.svg.png.webp","url":"Benktander_type_II_distribution"}
