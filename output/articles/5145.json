{"title":"Existential quantification","summary":"In predicate logic, an existential quantification is a type of quantifier, a logical constant which is interpreted as \"there exists\", \"there is at least one\", or \"for some\". It is usually denoted by the logical operator symbol ∃, which, when used together with a predicate variable, is called an existential quantifier (\"∃x\" or \"∃(x)\" or \"(∃x)\"[1]). Existential quantification is distinct from universal quantification (\"for all\"), which asserts that the property or relation holds for all members of the domain.[2][3] Some sources use the term existentialization to refer to existential quantification.[4]","image":"d4bb6d8a3cf6275a71b7183604aa81e8ba7edb50.svg","url":"Existential_quantification"}
