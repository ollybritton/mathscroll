{"title":"Simple set","summary":"In computability theory, a subset of the natural numbers is called simple if it is computably enumerable (c.e.) and co-infinite (i.e. its complement is infinite), but every infinite subset of its complement is not c.e..  Simple sets are examples of c.e. sets that are not computable.","image":"833c53157b3eef79e84533a73f6a2c42581348b2.svg","url":"Simple_set"}
