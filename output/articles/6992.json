{"title":"Height function","summary":"A height function is a function that quantifies the complexity of mathematical objects. In Diophantine geometry, height functions quantify the size of solutions to Diophantine equations and are typically functions from a set of points on algebraic varieties (or a set of algebraic varieties) to the real numbers.[1]","image":"8ac633bf7339eec8bd33be29a877d8991c2132ac.svg","url":"Height_function"}
