{"title":"Noncommutative geometry","summary":"Noncommutative geometry (NCG) is a branch of mathematics concerned with a geometric approach to noncommutative algebras, and with the construction of spaces that are locally presented by noncommutative algebras of functions (possibly in some generalized sense). A noncommutative algebra is an associative algebra in which the multiplication is not commutative, that is, for which x y {\\displaystyle xy} does not always equal y x {\\displaystyle yx} ; or more generally an algebraic structure in which one of the principal binary operations is not commutative; one also allows additional structures, e.g. topology or norm, to be possibly carried by the noncommutative algebra of functions.","image":"c72eb345e496513fb8b2fa4aa8c4d89b855f9a01.svg","url":"Noncommutative_geometry"}
