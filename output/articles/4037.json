{"title":"Diagonal functor","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the diagonal functor C → C × C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}\\rightarrow {\\mathcal {C}}\\times {\\mathcal {C}}} is given by Δ ( a ) = ⟨ a , a ⟩ {\\displaystyle \\Delta (a)=\\langle a,a\\rangle } , which maps objects as well as morphisms.  This functor can be employed to give a succinct alternate description of the product of objects within the category C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} : a product a × b {\\displaystyle a\\times b} is a universal arrow from Δ {\\displaystyle \\Delta } to ⟨ a , b ⟩ {\\displaystyle \\langle a,b\\rangle } .  The arrow comprises the projection maps.","image":"5939cfd72c2461b8d2bb087320a6e0343d6370f1.svg","url":"Diagonal_functor"}
