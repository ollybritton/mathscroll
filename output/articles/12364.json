{"title":"Polytope","summary":"In elementary geometry, a polytope is a geometric object with flat sides (faces). Polytopes are the generalization of three-dimensional polyhedra to any number of dimensions. Polytopes may exist in any general number of dimensions n as an n-dimensional polytope or n-polytope. For example, a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope. In this context, \"flat sides\" means that the sides of a (k + 1)-polytope consist of k-polytopes that may have (k â€“ 1)-polytopes in common.","image":"First_stellation_of_octahedron.png.webp","url":"Polytope"}
