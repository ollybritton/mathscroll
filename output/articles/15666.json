{"title":"The Principles of Quantum Mechanics","summary":"The Principles of Quantum Mechanics is an influential monograph on quantum mechanics written by Paul Dirac and first published by Oxford University Press in 1930.[1] Dirac gives an account of quantum mechanics by \"demonstrating how to construct a completely new theoretical framework from scratch\"; \"problems were tackled top-down, by working on the great principles, with the details left to look after themselves\".[2] It leaves classical physics behind after the first chapter, presenting the subject with a logical structure. Its 82 sections contain 785 equations with no diagrams.[2]","image":"The_principles_of_quantum_mechanics_-_title_page.jpg.webp","url":"The_Principles_of_Quantum_Mechanics"}
