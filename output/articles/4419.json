{"title":"Doob's martingale inequality","summary":"In mathematics, Doob's martingale inequality, also known as Kolmogorovâ€™s submartingale inequality is a result in the study of stochastic processes. It gives a bound on the probability that a submartingale exceeds any given value over a given interval of time. As the name suggests, the result is usually given in the case that the process is a martingale, but the result is also valid for submartingales.","image":"b25f6643236337b4eb8e8dd466229b563012750e.svg","url":"Doob's_martingale_inequality"}
