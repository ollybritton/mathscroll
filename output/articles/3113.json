{"title":"Computably inseparable","summary":"In computability theory, two disjoint sets of natural numbers are called computably inseparable or recursively inseparable if they cannot be \"separated\" with a computable set.[1]  These sets arise in the study of computability theory itself, particularly in relation to Π01 classes. Computably inseparable sets also arise in the study of Gödel's incompleteness theorem.","image":"23481b70762be5f14cd641dc7333da70f57227c1.svg","url":"Computably_inseparable"}
