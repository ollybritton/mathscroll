{"title":"Compound probability distribution","summary":"In probability and statistics, a compound probability distribution (also known as a mixture distribution or contagious distribution) is the probability distribution that results from assuming that a random variable is distributed according to some parametrized distribution, with (some of) the parameters of that distribution themselves being random variables. If the parameter is a scale parameter, the resulting mixture is also called a scale mixture.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Compound_probability_distribution"}
