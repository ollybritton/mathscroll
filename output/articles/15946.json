{"title":"Train track map","summary":"In the mathematical subject of geometric group theory, a train track map is a continuous map f from a finite connected graph to itself which is a homotopy equivalence and which has particularly nice cancellation properties with respect to iterations. This map sends vertices to vertices and edges to nontrivial edge-paths with the property that for every edge e of the graph and for every positive integer n the path fn(e) is immersed, that is fn(e) is locally injective on e. Train-track maps are a key tool in  analyzing the dynamics of automorphisms of finitely generated free groups and in the study of the Cullerâ€“Vogtmann Outer space.","image":"b16c85beac5dcab3754a4cad9aa73c345a6b321a.svg","url":"Train_track_map"}
