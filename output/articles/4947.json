{"title":"Erdős–Diophantine graph","summary":"An Erdős–Diophantine graph is an object in the mathematical subject of Diophantine equations consisting of a set of integer points at integer distances in the plane that cannot be extended by any additional points. Equivalently, in geometric graph theory, it can be described as a complete graph with vertices located on the integer square grid Z 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} ^{2}} such that all mutual distances between the vertices are integers, while all other grid points have a non-integer distance to at least one vertex.","image":"a807ab4cb3de13a66771b5a303aca31e0391e6aa.svg","url":"Erdős–Diophantine_graph"}
