{"title":"Generalized permutation matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a generalized permutation matrix (or monomial matrix) is a matrix with the same nonzero pattern as a permutation matrix, i.e. there is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and each column. Unlike a permutation matrix, where the nonzero entry must be 1, in a generalized permutation matrix the nonzero entry can be any nonzero value. An example of a generalized permutation matrix is","image":"f75238a5170f4d9156886b73bfeaaec0809cd6e2.svg","url":"Generalized_permutation_matrix"}
