{"title":"Lieb–Thirring inequality","summary":"In mathematics and physics, Lieb–Thirring inequalities provide an upper bound on the sums of powers of the negative eigenvalues of a Schrödinger operator in terms of integrals of the potential. They are named after E. H. Lieb and W. E. Thirring.","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Lieb–Thirring_inequality"}
