{"title":"Cyclotruncated 6-simplex honeycomb","summary":"In six-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the cyclotruncated 6-simplex honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). The tessellation fills space by 6-simplex, truncated 6-simplex, bitruncated 6-simplex, and tritruncated 6-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 2:2:2:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.","image":"CDel_branch_11.png.webp","url":"Cyclotruncated_6-simplex_honeycomb"}
