{"title":"p-curvature","summary":"In algebraic geometry, p-curvature is an invariant of a connection on a coherent sheaf for schemes of characteristic p > 0. It is a construction similar to a usual curvature, but only exists in finite characteristic.","image":"a3d0e93b78c50237f9ea83d027e4ebbdaef354b2.svg","url":"P-curvature"}
