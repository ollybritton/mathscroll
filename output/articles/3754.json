{"title":"Dandelin spheres","summary":"In geometry, the Dandelin spheres are one or two spheres that are tangent both to a plane and to a cone that intersects the plane. The intersection of the cone and the plane is a conic section, and the point at which either sphere touches the plane is a focus of the conic section, so the Dandelin spheres are also sometimes called focal spheres.[1]","image":"Dandelin_spheres.svg.png.webp","url":"Dandelin_spheres"}
