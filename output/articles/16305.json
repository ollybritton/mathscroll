{"title":"Ultrabornological space","summary":"In functional analysis, a topological vector space (TVS) X {\\displaystyle X} is called ultrabornological if every bounded linear operator from X {\\displaystyle X} into another TVS is necessarily continuous. A general version of the closed graph theorem holds for ultrabornological spaces. Ultrabornological spaces were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck (Grothendieck [1955, p. 17] \"espace du type (Î²)\").[1]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Ultrabornological_space"}
