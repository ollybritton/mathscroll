{"title":"Non-standard model of arithmetic","summary":"In mathematical logic, a non-standard model of arithmetic is a model of (first-order) Peano arithmetic that contains non-standard numbers.  The term standard model of arithmetic refers to the standard natural numbers 0, 1, 2, â€¦.  The elements of any model of Peano arithmetic are linearly ordered and possess an initial segment isomorphic to the standard natural numbers. A non-standard model is one that has additional elements outside this initial segment.  The construction of such models is due to Thoralf Skolem (1934).","image":"d21f68ea2744de7fc0a11e441727935fbaf31839.svg","url":"Non-standard_model_of_arithmetic"}
