{"title":"Linear function (calculus)","summary":"In calculus and related areas of mathematics, a linear function from the real numbers to the real numbers is a function whose graph (in Cartesian coordinates) is a non-vertical line in the plane.[1] The characteristic property of linear functions is that when the input variable is changed, the change in the output is proportional to the change in the input.","image":"Wiki_linear_function.png.webp","url":"Linear_function_(calculus)"}
