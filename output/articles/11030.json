{"title":"Neville's algorithm","summary":"In mathematics, Neville's algorithm is an algorithm used for polynomial interpolation that was derived by the mathematician Eric Harold Neville in 1934. Given n + 1 points, there is a unique polynomial of degree â‰¤ n which goes through the given points. Neville's algorithm evaluates this polynomial.","image":"b702828c1d332a4438d2f86544f1b184ee3fa05a.svg","url":"Neville's_algorithm"}
