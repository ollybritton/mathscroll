{"title":"Conjugate element (field theory)","summary":"In mathematics, in particular field theory, the conjugate elements or algebraic conjugates of an algebraic element α, over a field extension L/K, are the roots of the minimal polynomial pK,α(x) of α over K. Conjugate elements are commonly called conjugates in contexts where this is not ambiguous.  Normally α itself is included in the set of conjugates of α.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Conjugate_element_(field_theory)"}
