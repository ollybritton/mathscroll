{"title":"Dot product","summary":"In mathematics, the dot product or scalar product[note 1] is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors), and returns a single number.  In Euclidean geometry, the dot product of the Cartesian coordinates of two vectors is widely used. It is often called the inner product (or rarely projection product) of Euclidean space, even though it is not the only inner product that can be defined on Euclidean space (see  inner product space for more).","image":"5ed657d7f0d7aa156e7b9b171f22b4a3aa6482c3.svg","url":"Dot_product"}
