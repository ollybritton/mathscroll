{"title":"Genus g surface","summary":"In mathematics, a genus g surface (also known as a g-torus or g-holed torus) is a surface formed by the connected sum of g many tori: the interior of a disk is removed from each of g many tori and the boundaries of the g many disks are identified (glued together), forming a g-torus. The genus of such a surface is g.","image":"Sphere_filled_blue.svg.png.webp","url":"Genus_g_surface"}
