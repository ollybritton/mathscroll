{"title":"Tournament (graph theory)","summary":"A tournament is a directed graph (digraph) obtained by assigning a direction for each edge in an undirected complete graph. That is, it is an orientation of a complete graph, or equivalently a directed graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a directed edge (often, called an arc) with any one of the two possible orientations.","image":"4-tournament.svg.png.webp","url":"Tournament_(graph_theory)"}
