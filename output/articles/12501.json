{"title":"Primitive part and content","summary":"In algebra, the content of a nonzero polynomial with integer coefficients (or, more generally,  with coefficients in a unique factorization domain) is the greatest common divisor of its coefficients. The primitive part of such a polynomial is the quotient of the polynomial by its content. Thus a polynomial is the product of its primitive part and its content, and this factorization is unique up to the multiplication of the content by a unit of the ring of the coefficients (and the multiplication of the primitive part by the inverse of the unit).","image":"d7994778915bf08f322c3dc78595d3eb660ef365.svg","url":"Primitive_part_and_content"}
