{"title":"Rewriting","summary":"In mathematics, computer science, and logic, rewriting covers a wide range of methods of replacing subterms of a formula with other terms. Such methods may be achieved by rewriting systems (also known as rewrite systems, rewrite engines,[1][2] or reduction systems). In their most basic form, they consist of a set of objects, plus relations on how to transform those objects.","image":"84aaf1a07ba682fb0d3a84a80bc528871cd5bd78.svg","url":"Rewriting"}
