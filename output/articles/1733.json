{"title":"Bivector (complex)","summary":"In mathematics, a bivector is the vector part of a biquaternion. For biquaternion q = w + xi + yj + zk, w is called the biscalar and xi + yj + zk is its bivector part. The coordinates w, x, y, z are complex numbers with imaginary unit h:","image":"a35589cf5128b05d02ce60f3e839ce04aa57e835.svg","url":"Bivector_(complex)"}
