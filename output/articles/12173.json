{"title":"Pigeonhole principle","summary":"In mathematics, the pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.[1] For example, if one has three gloves (and none is ambidextrous/reversible), then there must be at least two right-handed gloves, or at least two left-handed gloves, because there are three objects, but only two categories of handedness to put them into. This seemingly obvious statement, a type of counting argument, can be used to demonstrate possibly unexpected results. For example, given that the population of London is greater than the maximum number of hairs that can be present on a human's head, then the pigeonhole principle requires that there must be at least two people in London who have the same number of hairs on their heads.","image":"TooManyPigeons.jpg.webp","url":"Pigeonhole_principle"}
