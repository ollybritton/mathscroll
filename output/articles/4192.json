{"title":"Directed infinity","summary":"A directed infinity is a type of infinity in the complex plane that has a defined complex argument θ but an infinite absolute value r.[1] For example, the limit of 1/x where x is a positive real number approaching zero is a directed infinity with argument 0; however, 1/0 is not a directed infinity, but a complex infinity. Some rules for manipulation of directed infinities (with all variables finite) are:","image":"c26cac9768bb6d685006c9cc631a860a49282bc7.svg","url":"Directed_infinity"}
