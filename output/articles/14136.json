{"title":"Semiparametric regression","summary":"In statistics, semiparametric regression includes regression models that combine parametric  and nonparametric models. They are often used in situations where the fully nonparametric model may not perform well or when the researcher wants to use a parametric model but the functional form with respect to a subset of the regressors or the density of the errors is not known. Semiparametric regression models are a particular type of semiparametric modelling and, since semiparametric models contain a parametric component, they rely on parametric assumptions and may be misspecified and inconsistent, just like a fully parametric model.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Semiparametric_regression"}
