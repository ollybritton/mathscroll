{"title":"Proof that π is irrational","summary":"In the 1760s, Johann Heinrich Lambert was the first to prove that the number π is irrational, meaning it cannot be expressed as a fraction a / b {\\displaystyle a/b} , where a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} are both integers. In the 19th century, Charles Hermite found a proof that requires no prerequisite knowledge beyond basic calculus. Three simplifications of Hermite's proof are due to Mary Cartwright, Ivan Niven, and Nicolas Bourbaki. Another proof, which is a simplification of Lambert's proof, is due to Miklós Laczkovich. Many of these are proofs by contradiction.","image":"4a1b6c014398323cb45578581a536033fce1b28c.svg","url":"Proof_that_π_is_irrational"}
