{"title":"Lp sum","summary":"In mathematics, and specifically in functional analysis, the Lp sum of a family of Banach spaces is a way of turning a subset of the product set of the members of the family into a Banach space in its own right. The construction is motivated by the classical Lp spaces.[1]","image":"2ab2d7b5f5e797cd2f5436d3c2ca928e5340d27b.svg","url":"Lp_sum"}
