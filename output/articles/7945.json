{"title":"Intersection theory","summary":"In mathematics, intersection theory is one of the main branches of algebraic geometry, where it gives information about the intersection of two subvarieties of a given variety.[1] The theory for varieties is older, with roots in BÃ©zout's theorem on curves and elimination theory. On the other hand, the topological theory more quickly reached a definitive form.","image":"ac049c37858cc3f00ae99c97aff5e45f569ff5d9.svg","url":"Intersection_theory"}
