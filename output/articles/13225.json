{"title":"Rectified prism","summary":"In geometry, a rectified prism (also rectified bipyramid) is one of an infinite set of polyhedra, constructed as a rectification of an n-gonal prism, truncating the vertices down to the midpoint of the original edges. In Conway polyhedron notation, it is represented as aPn, an ambo-prism. The lateral squares or rectangular faces of the prism become squares or rhombic faces, and new isosceles triangle faces are truncations of the original vertices.","image":"Rectified_pentagonal_prism.png.webp","url":"Rectified_prism"}
