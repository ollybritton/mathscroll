{"title":"Aronszajn tree","summary":"In set theory, an Aronszajn tree is a tree of uncountable height with no uncountable branches and no uncountable levels. For example, every Suslin tree is an Aronszajn tree. More generally, for a cardinal κ, a κ-Aronszajn tree is a tree of height κ in which all levels have size less than κ and all branches have height less than κ (so Aronszajn trees are the same as ℵ 1 {\\displaystyle \\aleph _{1}} -Aronszajn trees). They are named for Nachman Aronszajn, who constructed an Aronszajn tree in 1934; his construction was described by Kurepa (1935).","image":"78c211ce8badf4ffbf9417ecceb0ef7ab0a8caed.svg","url":"Aronszajn_tree"}
