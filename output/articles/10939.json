{"title":"Nash blowing-up","summary":"In algebraic geometry, Nash blowing-up is a process in which, roughly speaking, each singular point is replaced by all limiting positions of the tangent spaces at the non-singular points. More formally, let X {\\displaystyle X} be an algebraic variety of pure dimension r embedded in a smooth variety Y {\\displaystyle Y} of dimension n, and let X reg {\\displaystyle X_{\\text{reg}}} be the complement of the singular locus of X {\\displaystyle X} . Define a map τ : X reg → X × G r ( T Y ) {\\displaystyle \\tau :X_{\\text{reg}}\\rightarrow X\\times G_{r}(TY)} , where G r ( T Y ) {\\displaystyle G_{r}(TY)} is the Grassmannian of r-planes in the tangent bundle of Y {\\displaystyle Y} , by τ ( a ) := ( a , T X , a ) {\\displaystyle \\tau (a):=(a,T_{X,a})} , where T X , a {\\displaystyle T_{X,a}} is the tangent space of X {\\displaystyle X} at a {\\displaystyle a} . The closure of the image of this map together with the projection to X {\\displaystyle X} is called the Nash blow-up of X {\\displaystyle X} .","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Nash_blowing-up"}
