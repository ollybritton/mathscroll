{"title":"Minkowski problem for polytopes","summary":"In the geometry of convex polytopes, the Minkowski problem for polytopes concerns the specification of the shape of a polytope by the directions and measures of its facets.[1] The theorem that every polytope is uniquely determined up to translation by this information was proven by Hermann Minkowski; it has been called \"Minkowski's theorem\", although the same name has also been given to several unrelated results of Minkowski.[2] The Minkowski problem for polytopes should also be distinguished from the Minkowski problem, on specifying convex shapes by their curvature.","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Minkowski_problem_for_polytopes"}
