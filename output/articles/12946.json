{"title":"Quasitoric manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a quasitoric manifold is a topological analogue of the nonsingular projective toric variety of algebraic geometry. A smooth 2 n {\\displaystyle 2n} -dimensional manifold is a quasitoric manifold if it admits a smooth, locally standard action of an n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional torus, with orbit space an n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional simple convex polytope.","image":"134afa8ff09fdddd24b06f289e92e3a045092bd1.svg","url":"Quasitoric_manifold"}
