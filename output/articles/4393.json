{"title":"Domatic number","summary":"In graph theory, a domatic partition of a graph G = ( V , E ) {\\displaystyle G=(V,E)} is a partition of V {\\displaystyle V} into disjoint sets V 1 {\\displaystyle V_{1}} , V 2 {\\displaystyle V_{2}} ,..., V K {\\displaystyle V_{K}} such that each Vi is a dominating set for G. The figure on the right shows a domatic partition of a graph; here the dominating set V 1 {\\displaystyle V_{1}} consists of the yellow vertices, V 2 {\\displaystyle V_{2}} consists of the green vertices, and V 3 {\\displaystyle V_{3}} consists of the blue vertices.","image":"644a8d85ee410b6159ca2bdb5dcb9097e2c8f182.svg","url":"Domatic_number"}
