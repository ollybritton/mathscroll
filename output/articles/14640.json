{"title":"Socolar–Taylor tile","summary":"The Socolar–Taylor tile is a single non-connected tile which is aperiodic on the Euclidean plane, meaning that it admits only non-periodic tilings of the plane (due to the Sierpinski's triangle-like tiling that occurs), with rotations and reflections of the tile allowed.[1] It is the first known example of a single aperiodic tile, or \"einstein\".[2] The basic version of the tile is a simple hexagon, with printed designs to enforce a local matching rule, regarding how the tiles may be placed.[3]","image":"Socolar-Taylor_tiling.svg.png.webp","url":"Socolar–Taylor_tile"}
