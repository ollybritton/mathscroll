{"title":"Finite group","summary":"In abstract algebra, a finite group is a group whose underlying set is finite.  Finite groups often arise when considering symmetry of mathematical or physical objects, when those objects admit just a finite number of structure-preserving transformations.  Important examples of finite groups include cyclic groups and permutation groups.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Finite_group"}
