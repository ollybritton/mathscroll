{"title":"Invertible sheaf","summary":"In mathematics, an invertible sheaf is a coherent sheaf S on a ringed space X, for which there is an inverse T with respect to tensor product of OX-modules. It is the equivalent in algebraic geometry of the topological notion of a line bundle. Due to their interactions with Cartier divisors, they play a central role in the study of algebraic varieties.","image":"64b37fa4dcba70492c4bbe035ada79fe68046727.svg","url":"Invertible_sheaf"}
