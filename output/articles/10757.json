{"title":"Moy–Prasad filtration","summary":"In mathematics, the Moy–Prasad  filtration is a family of filtrations of p-adic reductive groups and their Lie algebras, named after Allen Moy and Gopal Prasad. The family is parameterized by the Bruhat–Tits building; that is, each point of the building gives a different filtration. Alternatively, since the initial term in each filtration at a point of the building is the parahoric subgroup for that point, the Moy–Prasad  filtration can be viewed as a filtration of a parahoric subgroup of a reductive group.","image":"35f44bc6894c682710705f3ea74f33042e0acc3e.svg","url":"Moy–Prasad_filtration"}
