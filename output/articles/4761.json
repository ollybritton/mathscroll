{"title":"Elliptic rational functions","summary":"In mathematics the elliptic rational functions are a sequence of rational functions with real coefficients. Elliptic rational functions are extensively used in the design of elliptic electronic filters. (These functions are sometimes called Chebyshev rational functions, not to be confused with certain other functions of the same name).","image":"Rational_Elliptic_Functions_(n%3D1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C_x%3D--1%2C1-).svg.png.webp","url":"Elliptic_rational_functions"}
