{"title":"Lanczos algorithm","summary":"The Lanczos algorithm is an iterative method devised by Cornelius Lanczos that is an adaptation of power methods to find the m {\\displaystyle m} \"most useful\" (tending towards extreme highest/lowest) eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an n Ã— n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} Hermitian matrix, where m {\\displaystyle m} is often but not necessarily much smaller than n {\\displaystyle n} .[1] Although computationally efficient in principle, the method as initially formulated was not useful, due to its numerical instability.","image":"0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc.svg","url":"Lanczos_algorithm"}
