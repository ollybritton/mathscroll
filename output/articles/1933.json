{"title":"Bramble (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, a bramble for an undirected graph G is a family of connected subgraphs of G that all touch each other: for every pair of disjoint subgraphs, there must exist an edge in G that has one endpoint in each subgraph. The order of a bramble is the smallest size of a hitting set, a set of vertices of G that has a nonempty intersection with each of the subgraphs. Brambles may be used to characterize the treewidth of G.[1]","image":"3x3_grid_graph_haven.svg.png.webp","url":"Bramble_(graph_theory)"}
