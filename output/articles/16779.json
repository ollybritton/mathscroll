{"title":"Weakly measurable function","summary":"In mathematics—specifically, in functional analysis—a weakly measurable function taking values in a Banach space is a function whose composition with any element of the dual space is a measurable function in the usual (strong) sense.  For separable spaces, the notions of weak and strong measurability agree.","image":"63c4fcf15808c3dbf52cc4b3fd473e97e231f53f.svg","url":"Weakly_measurable_function"}
