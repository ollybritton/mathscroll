{"title":"Homotopy analysis method","summary":"The homotopy analysis method (HAM) is a semi-analytical technique to solve nonlinear ordinary/partial differential equations.  The homotopy analysis method employs the concept of the homotopy from topology to generate a convergent series solution for nonlinear systems.  This is enabled by utilizing a homotopy-Maclaurin series to deal with the nonlinearities in the system.","image":"HomotopySmall.gif","url":"Homotopy_analysis_method"}
