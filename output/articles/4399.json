{"title":"Dominating set","summary":"In graph theory, a dominating set for a graph G is a subset D of its vertices, such that any vertex of G is either in D, or has a neighbor in D. The domination number Î³(G) is the number of vertices in a smallest dominating set for G.","image":"Dominating-set.svg.png.webp","url":"Dominating_set"}
