{"title":"Definite quadratic form","summary":"In mathematics, a definite quadratic form is a quadratic form over some real vector space V that has the same sign (always positive or always negative) for every non-zero vector of V. According to that sign, the quadratic form is called positive-definite or negative-definite.","image":"cfbe7088c234bad711fe43fd60d8628520be8bb7.svg","url":"Definite_quadratic_form"}
