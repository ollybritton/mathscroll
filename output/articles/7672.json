{"title":"Implicit curve","summary":"In mathematics, an implicit curve is a plane curve defined by an implicit equation relating two coordinate variables, commonly x and y. For example, the unit circle is defined by the implicit equation x 2 + y 2 = 1 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=1} . In general, every implicit curve is defined by an equation of the form","image":"ec84b90236512e8d27ff1a8f7707b60b63327de1.svg","url":"Implicit_curve"}
