{"title":"Algebra homomorphism","summary":"In mathematics, an algebra homomorphism is a homomorphism between two  algebras. More precisely, if A and B are algebras over a field (or a ring) K, it is a function F : A â†’ B {\\displaystyle F\\colon A\\to B} such that, for all k in K and x, y in A, one has[1][2]","image":"3cfbc3fd174d1c062c103e88c174b67d72f483cb.svg","url":"Algebra_homomorphism"}
