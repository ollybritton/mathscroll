{"title":"Hypergraph regularity method","summary":"In mathematics, the hypergraph regularity method is a powerful tool in extremal graph theory that refers to the combined application of the hypergraph regularity lemma and the associated counting lemma. It is a generalization of the graph regularity method, which refers to the use of Szemer√©di's regularity and counting lemmas.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Hypergraph_regularity_method"}
