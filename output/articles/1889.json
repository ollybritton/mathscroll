{"title":"Boundary value problem","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of differential equations, a boundary value problem is a differential equation together with a set of additional constraints, called the boundary conditions.[1] A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the differential equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.","image":"Boundary_value_problem-en.svg.png.webp","url":"Boundary_value_problem"}
