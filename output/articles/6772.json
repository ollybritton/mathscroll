{"title":"Hadamard's dynamical system","summary":"In physics and mathematics, the Hadamard dynamical system (also called Hadamard's billiard or the Hadamardâ€“Gutzwiller model[1]) is a chaotic dynamical system, a type of dynamical billiards. Introduced by Jacques Hadamard in 1898,[2] and studied by Martin Gutzwiller in the 1980s,[3][4] it is the first dynamical system to be proven chaotic.","image":"be31a1345d31127e93106d29c124d3860067bbe6.svg","url":"Hadamard's_dynamical_system"}
