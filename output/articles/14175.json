{"title":"Sequence transformation","summary":"In mathematics, a sequence transformation is an operator acting on a given space of sequences (a sequence space). Sequence transformations include linear mappings such as convolution with another sequence, and resummation of a sequence and, more generally, are commonly used for series acceleration, that is, for improving the rate of convergence of a slowly convergent sequence or series. Sequence transformations are also commonly used to compute the  antilimit of a divergent series numerically, and are used in conjunction with extrapolation methods.","image":"e1e69c33600911bc111d6d1b00f72698edd3a0cb.svg","url":"Sequence_transformation"}
