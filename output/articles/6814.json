{"title":"Halin's grid theorem","summary":"In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, Halin's grid theorem states that the infinite graphs with thick ends are exactly the graphs containing subdivisions of the hexagonal tiling of the plane.[1] It was published by Rudolf HalinÂ (1965), and is a precursor to the work of Robertson and Seymour linking treewidth to large grid minors, which became an important component of the algorithmic theory of bidimensionality.","image":"Tiling_Regular_6-3_Hexagonal.svg.png.webp","url":"Halin's_grid_theorem"}
