{"title":"Frobenius–Schur indicator","summary":"In mathematics, and especially the discipline of representation theory, the Schur indicator, named after Issai Schur, or Frobenius–Schur indicator describes what invariant bilinear forms a given irreducible representation of a compact group on a complex vector space has. It can be used to classify the  irreducible representations of compact groups on real vector spaces.","image":"2fcefbc4e519a1285205270cfd49fd67fbb74cb0.svg","url":"Frobenius–Schur_indicator"}
