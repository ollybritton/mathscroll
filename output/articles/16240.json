{"title":"Tutte embedding","summary":"In graph drawing and geometric graph theory, a Tutte embedding or barycentric embedding of a simple, 3-vertex-connected, planar graph is a crossing-free straight-line embedding with the properties that the outer face is a convex polygon and that each interior vertex is at the average (or barycenter) of its neighbors' positions. If the outer polygon is fixed, this condition on the interior vertices determines their position uniquely as the solution to a system of linear equations. Solving the equations geometrically produces a planar embedding. Tutte's spring theorem, proven by W. T. TutteÂ (1963), states that this unique solution is always crossing-free, and more strongly that every face of the resulting planar embedding is convex.[1] It is called the spring theorem because such an embedding can be found as the equilibrium position for a system of springs representing the edges of the graph.","image":"Tutte_cube.svg.png.webp","url":"Tutte_embedding"}
