{"title":"Lebesgue integration","summary":"In mathematics, the integral of a non-negative function of a single variable can be regarded, in the simplest case, as the area between the graph of that function and the x-axis. The Lebesgue integral, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, extends the integral to a larger class of functions. It also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined.","image":"Integral-area-under-curve.svg.png.webp","url":"Lebesgue_integration"}
