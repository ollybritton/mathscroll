{"title":"Pseudo-differential operator","summary":"In mathematical analysis a pseudo-differential operator  is an extension of the concept of differential operator. Pseudo-differential operators are used extensively in the theory of partial differential equations and quantum field theory, e.g. in mathematical models that include ultrametric pseudo-differential equations in a non-Archimedean space.","image":"18115569ce3c6c5b96e8a155bfbbaf2a93797a2e.svg","url":"Pseudo-differential_operator"}
