{"title":"Sedrakyan's inequality","summary":"The following inequality is known as Sedrakyan's inequality,   Bergström's inequality, Engel's form or Titu's lemma, respectively, referring to the article About the applications of one useful inequality of Nairi Sedrakyan published in 1997,[1] to the book Problem-solving strategies of Arthur Engel published in 1998 and to the book Mathematical Olympiad Treasures of Titu Andreescu published in 2003.[2][3] It is a direct consequence of Cauchy–Bunyakovsky–Schwarz inequality. Nevertheless, in his article (1997) Sedrakyan has noticed that written in this form this inequality can be used as a mathematical proof technique and it has very useful new applications. In the book Algebraic Inequalities (Sedrakyan) are provided several generalizations of this inequality.[4]","image":"b279cb74e43e5ac622f68e86ec3ffd00fd6be531.svg","url":"Sedrakyan's_inequality"}
