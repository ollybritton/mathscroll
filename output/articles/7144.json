{"title":"Heun's method","summary":"In mathematics and computational science, Heun's method may refer to the improved[1] or modified Euler's method (that is, the explicit trapezoidal rule[2]), or a similar two-stage Runge–Kutta method. It is named after Karl Heun and is a numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. Both variants can be seen as extensions of the Euler method into two-stage second-order Runge–Kutta methods.","image":"c23fb210b5b081d30b297cb7e7ec54e9522e7cd7.svg","url":"Heun's_method"}
