{"title":"Vermeil's theorem","summary":"In differential geometry, Vermeil's theorem essentially states that the scalar curvature is the only (non-trivial) absolute invariant among those of prescribed type suitable for Albert Einsteinâ€™s theory of General Relativity. The theorem was proved by the German mathematician Hermann Vermeil in 1917.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Vermeil's_theorem"}
