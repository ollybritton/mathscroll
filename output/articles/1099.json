{"title":"Asymptotic dimension","summary":"In metric geometry, asymptotic dimension of a metric space is a large-scale analog of Lebesgue covering dimension.  The notion of asymptotic dimension was introduced by Mikhail Gromov in his 1993 monograph Asymptotic invariants of infinite groups[1] in the context of geometric group theory, as a quasi-isometry invariant of finitely generated groups. As shown by Guoliang Yu, finitely generated groups of finite homotopy type with finite asymptotic dimension satisfy the Novikov conjecture.[2]  Asymptotic dimension has important applications in geometric analysis and index theory.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Asymptotic_dimension"}
