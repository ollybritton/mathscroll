{"title":"Holt graph","summary":"In graph theory, the Holt graph or Doyle graph is the smallest half-transitive graph, that is, the smallest example of a vertex-transitive and edge-transitive graph which is not also symmetric.[1][2] Such graphs are not common.[3]  It is named after Peter G. Doyle and Derek F. Holt, who discovered the same graph independently in 1976[4] and 1981[5] respectively.","image":"HoltGraph.svg.png.webp","url":"Holt_graph"}
