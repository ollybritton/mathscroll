{"title":"Néron model","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the Néron model (or Néron minimal model, or minimal model) for an abelian variety AK defined over the field of fractions K  of a Dedekind domain R is the \"push-forward\" of AK from Spec(K) to Spec(R), in other words the \"best possible\"  group scheme AR defined over R corresponding to AK.","image":"8a5fdaab4e43d62ef48065a7535dc8382cbd21d8.svg","url":"Néron_model"}
