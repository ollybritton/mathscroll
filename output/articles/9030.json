{"title":"Laplacian of the indicator","summary":"In mathematics, the Laplacian of the indicator of the domain D is a generalisation of the derivative of the Dirac delta function to higher dimensions, and is non-zero only on the surface of D. It can be viewed as the surface delta prime function. It is analogous to the second derivative of the Heaviside step function in one dimension. It can be obtained by letting the Laplace operator work on the indicator function of some domain D.","image":"Laplacian_of_the_indicator_v2.jpg.webp","url":"Laplacian_of_the_indicator"}
