{"title":"Period (algebraic geometry)","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a period is a number that can be expressed as an integral of an algebraic function over an algebraic domain. Sums and products of periods remain periods, so the periods form a ring.","image":"495eb9a769ac0d8011fc13319e2e7b140c940792.svg","url":"Period_(algebraic_geometry)"}
