{"title":"Admissible decision rule","summary":"In statistical decision theory, an admissible decision rule is a rule for making a decision such that there is no other rule that is always \"better\" than it[1] (or at least sometimes better and never worse), in the precise sense of \"better\" defined below. This concept is analogous to Pareto efficiency.","image":"Bayes_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Admissible_decision_rule"}
