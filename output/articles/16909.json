{"title":"Wiener–Araya graph","summary":"The Wiener–Araya graph is, in graph theory, a graph on 42 vertices with 67 edges. It is hypohamiltonian, which means that it does not itself have a Hamiltonian cycle but every graph formed by removing a single vertex from it is Hamiltonian. It is also planar.","image":"Wiener-Araya.svg.png.webp","url":"Wiener–Araya_graph"}
