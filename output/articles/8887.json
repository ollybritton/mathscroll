{"title":"Kuratowski's theorem","summary":"In graph theory, Kuratowski's theorem is a mathematical forbidden graph characterization of planar graphs, named after Kazimierz Kuratowski.  It states that a finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K 5 {\\displaystyle K_{5}} (the complete graph on five vertices) or of K 3 , 3 {\\displaystyle K_{3,3}} (a complete bipartite graph on six vertices, three of which connect to each of the other three, also known as the utility graph).","image":"10a83da34fe45aa3be9a7d0b197417021bb4a884.svg","url":"Kuratowski's_theorem"}
