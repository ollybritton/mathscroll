{"title":"Yang–Mills–Higgs equations","summary":"In mathematics, the Yang–Mills–Higgs equations are a set of non-linear partial differential equations for a Yang–Mills field, given by a connection, and a Higgs field, given by a section of a vector bundle (specifically, the adjoint bundle). These equations are","image":"9ae41f8395208616f52d865665f3fbd4a4e36aaa.svg","url":"Yang–Mills–Higgs_equations"}
