{"title":"Geometric measure theory","summary":"In mathematics, geometric measure theory (GMT) is the study of geometric properties of sets (typically in Euclidean space) through measure theory. It allows mathematicians to extend tools from differential geometry to a much larger class of surfaces that are not necessarily smooth.","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg","url":"Geometric_measure_theory"}
