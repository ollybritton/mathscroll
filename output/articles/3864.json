{"title":"Decomposition of spectrum (functional analysis)","summary":"The spectrum of a linear operator T {\\displaystyle T} that operates on a Banach space X {\\displaystyle X} is a fundamental concept of functional analysis. The spectrum consists of all scalars λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } such that the operator T − λ {\\displaystyle T-\\lambda } does not have a bounded inverse on X {\\displaystyle X} .  The spectrum has a standard decomposition into three parts:","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Decomposition_of_spectrum_(functional_analysis)"}
