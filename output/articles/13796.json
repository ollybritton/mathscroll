{"title":"Runcinated tesseractic honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the runcinated tesseractic honeycomb is a uniform  space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 4-space. It is constructed by a runcination of a tesseractic honeycomb creating runcinated tesseracts, and new tesseract, rectified tesseract and cuboctahedral prism facets.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Runcinated_tesseractic_honeycomb"}
