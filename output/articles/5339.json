{"title":"Fenchel's theorem","summary":"In differential geometry, Fenchel's theorem is an inequality on the total absolute curvature of a closed smooth space curve, stating that it is always at least 2 π {\\displaystyle 2\\pi } . Equivalently, the average curvature is at least 2 π / L {\\displaystyle 2\\pi /L} , where L {\\displaystyle L} is the length of the curve. The only curves of this type whose total absolute curvature equals 2 π {\\displaystyle 2\\pi } and whose average curvature equals 2 π / L {\\displaystyle 2\\pi /L} are the plane convex curves. The theorem is named after Werner Fenchel, who published it in 1929.","image":"73efd1f6493490b058097060a572606d2c550a06.svg","url":"Fenchel's_theorem"}
