{"title":"Proof by contradiction","summary":"In logic, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction. Although it is quite freely used in mathematical proofs, not every school of mathematical thought accepts this kind of nonconstructive proof as universally valid.","image":"056a5ffbbbfb285b6959e55f96c84e0751ebd6a9.svg","url":"Proof_by_contradiction"}
