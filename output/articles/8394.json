{"title":"Join (topology)","summary":"In topology, a field of mathematics, the join of two topological spaces A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} , often denoted by A ∗ B {\\displaystyle A\\ast B} or A ⋆ B {\\displaystyle A\\star B} , is a topological space formed by taking the disjoint union of the two spaces, and attaching line segments joining every point in A {\\displaystyle A} to every point in B {\\displaystyle B} . The join of a space A {\\displaystyle A} with itself is denoted by A ⋆ 2 := A ⋆ A {\\displaystyle A^{\\star 2}:=A\\star A} . The join is defined in slightly different ways in different contexts","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Join_(topology)"}
