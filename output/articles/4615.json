{"title":"Edge tessellation","summary":"In geometry, an edge tessellation is a partition of the plane into non-overlapping polygons (a tessellation) with the property that the reflection of any of these polygons across any of its edges is another polygon in the tessellation. All of the resulting polygons must be convex, and congruent to each other. There are eight possible edge tessellations in Euclidean geometry,[1] but others exist in non-Euclidean geometry.","image":"Stacked_bond.png.webp","url":"Edge_tessellation"}
