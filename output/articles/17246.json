{"title":"μ operator","summary":"In computability theory, the μ-operator, minimization operator, or unbounded search operator searches for the least natural number with a given property. Adding the μ-operator to the primitive recursive functions makes it possible to define all computable functions.","image":"ef1d39463e7a365cf1592d6f4a21af8ebcf17afe.svg","url":"Μ_operator"}
