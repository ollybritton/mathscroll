{"title":"Natural logarithm","summary":"The natural logarithm of a number is its logarithm to the base of the mathematical constant e, which is an irrational and transcendental number approximately equal to 2.718281828459. The natural logarithm of x is generally written as ln x, loge x,  or sometimes, if the base e is implicit, simply log x.[1][2] Parentheses are sometimes added for clarity, giving ln(x), loge(x), or log(x). This is done particularly when the argument to the logarithm is not a single symbol, so as to prevent ambiguity.","image":"Log_(2).svg.png.webp","url":"Natural_logarithm"}
