{"title":"Slide rule scale","summary":"A slide rule scale is a line with graduated markings  inscribed along the length of a slide rule used for mathematical calculations. The earliest such device had a single logarithmic scale for performing multiplication and division but soon an improved technique was developed which involved two such scales sliding alongside each other â€“ hence the name slide rule (colloquially called a slipstick in the United States). Later, multiple scales were provided with the most basic being logarithmic but with others graduated according to the mathematical function required.","image":"Keuffel_and_Esser-Model_4181-1_Log_log_Duplex_Decitrig_slide_rule-IMG_5821-white_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Slide_rule_scale"}
