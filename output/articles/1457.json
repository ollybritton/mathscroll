{"title":"Benson's algorithm","summary":"Benson's algorithm, named after Harold Benson, is a method for solving multi-objective linear programming problems and vector linear programs.  This works by finding the \"efficient extreme points in the outcome set\".[1]  The primary concept in Benson's algorithm is to evaluate the upper image of the vector optimization problem by cutting planes.[2]","image":"93d96699cf8198dd7d61bd62d20e56443a96d7e3.svg","url":"Benson's_algorithm"}
