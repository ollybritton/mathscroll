{"title":"Type constructor","summary":"In the area of mathematical logic and computer science known as type theory, a type constructor is a feature of a typed formal language that builds new types from old ones. Basic types are considered to be built using nullary type constructors. Some type constructors take another type as an argument, e.g., the constructors for product types, function types, power types and list types. New types can be defined by recursively composing type constructors.","image":"8e9972f426d9e07855984f73ee195a21dbc21755.svg","url":"Type_constructor"}
