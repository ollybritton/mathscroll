{"title":"Slope field","summary":"Slope fields (also called direction fields[1]) are a graphical representation of the solutions to a first-order differential equation[2] of a scalar function. Solutions to a slope field are functions drawn as solid curves. A slope field shows the slope of a differential equation at certain vertical and horizontal intervals on the x-y plane, and can be used to determine the approximate tangent slope at a point on a curve, where the curve is some solution to the differential equation.","image":"Slope_Field.png.webp","url":"Slope_field"}
