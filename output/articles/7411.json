{"title":"Hopfion","summary":"A hopfion is a topological soliton.[1][2][3] It is a stable three-dimensional localised configuration of a three-component field n â†’ = ( n x , n y , n z ) {\\displaystyle {\\vec {n}}=(n_{x},n_{y},n_{z})} with a knotted topological structure. They are the three-dimensional counterparts of skyrmions, which exhibit similar topological properties in 2D.","image":"ae3c51016598d6dec8c1a4b9bf6373ef82bce396.svg","url":"Hopfion"}
