{"title":"Fundamental vector field","summary":"In the study of mathematics and especially differential geometry, fundamental vector fields are an instrument that describes the infinitesimal behaviour of a smooth Lie group action on a smooth manifold. Such vector fields find important applications in the study of Lie theory, symplectic geometry, and the study of Hamiltonian group actions.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Fundamental_vector_field"}
