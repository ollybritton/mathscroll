{"title":"Star (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, a star Sk is the complete bipartite graph K1,k : a tree with one internal node and k leaves (but no internal nodes and k + 1 leaves when k ≤ 1).  Alternatively, some authors define Sk to be the tree of order k with maximum diameter 2; in which case a star of k > 2 has k − 1 leaves.","image":"Star_network_7.svg.png.webp","url":"Star_(graph_theory)"}
