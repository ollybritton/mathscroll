{"title":"Breather","summary":"In physics, a breather is a nonlinear wave  in which energy concentrates in a localized and oscillatory fashion. This contradicts with the expectations derived from the corresponding linear system for infinitesimal amplitudes, which tends towards an even distribution of initially localized energy.","image":"Breather-surface.png.webp","url":"Breather"}
