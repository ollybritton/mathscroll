{"title":"Johnson scheme","summary":"In mathematics, the Johnson scheme, named after Selmer M. Johnson, is also known as the triangular association scheme. It consists of the set of all binary vectors X of length ℓ and weight n, such that v = | X | = ( ℓ n ) {\\displaystyle v=\\left|X\\right|={\\binom {\\ell }{n}}} .[1][2][3]  Two vectors x, y ∈ X are called ith associates if dist(x, y) = 2i for i = 0, 1, ..., n. The eigenvalues are given by","image":"ac1cbac293c5d636aec67323177b6d9e8a98c7cd.svg","url":"Johnson_scheme"}
