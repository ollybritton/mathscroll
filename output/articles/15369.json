{"title":"Symmetric function","summary":"In mathematics, a function of n {\\displaystyle n} variables is symmetric if its value is the same no matter the order of its arguments. For example, a function f ( x 1 , x 2 ) {\\displaystyle f\\left(x_{1},x_{2}\\right)} of two arguments is a symmetric function if and only if f ( x 1 , x 2 ) = f ( x 2 , x 1 ) {\\displaystyle f\\left(x_{1},x_{2}\\right)=f\\left(x_{2},x_{1}\\right)} for all x 1 {\\displaystyle x_{1}} and x 2 {\\displaystyle x_{2}} such that ( x 1 , x 2 ) {\\displaystyle \\left(x_{1},x_{2}\\right)} and ( x 2 , x 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\left(x_{2},x_{1}\\right)} are in the domain of f . {\\displaystyle f.} The most commonly encountered symmetric functions are polynomial functions, which are given by the symmetric polynomials.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Symmetric_function"}
