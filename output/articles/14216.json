{"title":"Sesquilinear form","summary":"In mathematics, a sesquilinear form is a generalization of a bilinear form that, in turn, is a generalization of the concept of the dot product of Euclidean space. A bilinear form is linear in each of its arguments, but a sesquilinear form allows one of the arguments to be \"twisted\" in a semilinear manner, thus the name; which originates from the Latin numerical prefix sesqui- meaning \"one and a half\". The basic concept of the dot product – producing a scalar from a pair of vectors – can be generalized by allowing a broader range of scalar values and, perhaps simultaneously, by widening the definition of a vector.","image":"068c328b1030876cc80b53dcbeac12344c565426.svg","url":"Sesquilinear_form"}
