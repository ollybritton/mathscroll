{"title":"Miquel configuration","summary":"In geometry, the Miquel configuration is a configuration of eight points and six circles in the Euclidean plane, with four points per circle and three circles through each point.[1] Its Levi graph is the Rhombic dodecahedral graph, the skeleton of both Rhombic dodecahedron and Bilinski dodecahedron. The configuration is related to Miquel's theorem.","image":"Miquel_isometric.svg.png.webp","url":"Miquel_configuration"}
