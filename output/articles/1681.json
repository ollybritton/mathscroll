{"title":"Bipartite realization problem","summary":"The bipartite realization problem is a classical decision problem in graph theory, a branch of combinatorics. Given two finite sequences ( a 1 , … , a n ) {\\displaystyle (a_{1},\\dots ,a_{n})} and ( b 1 , … , b n ) {\\displaystyle (b_{1},\\dots ,b_{n})} of natural numbers, the problem asks whether there is labeled simple bipartite graph such that ( a 1 , … , a n ) , ( b 1 , … , b n ) {\\displaystyle (a_{1},\\dots ,a_{n}),(b_{1},\\dots ,b_{n})} is the degree sequence of this bipartite graph.","image":"f32ea8be17cff0b2d07309b931aa8a6af949ac8d.svg","url":"Bipartite_realization_problem"}
