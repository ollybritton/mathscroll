{"title":"Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)","summary":"In complex analysis, Liouville's theorem, named after Joseph Liouville (although the theorem was first proven by Cauchy in 1844[1]), states that every bounded entire function must be constant. That is, every holomorphic function f {\\displaystyle f} for which there exists a positive number M {\\displaystyle M} such that | f ( z ) | â‰¤ M {\\displaystyle |f(z)|\\leq M} for all z {\\displaystyle z} in C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } is constant. Equivalently, non-constant holomorphic functions on C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } have unbounded images.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Liouville's_theorem_(complex_analysis)"}
