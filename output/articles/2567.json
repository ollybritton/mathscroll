{"title":"Chi-squared distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the chi-squared distribution (also chi-square or Ï‡ 2 {\\displaystyle \\chi ^{2}} -distribution) with k {\\displaystyle k} degrees of freedom is the distribution of a sum of the squares of k {\\displaystyle k} independent standard normal random variables. The chi-squared distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution and is one of the most widely used probability distributions in inferential statistics, notably in hypothesis testing and in construction of confidence intervals.[2][3][4][5] This distribution is sometimes called the central chi-squared distribution, a special case of the more general noncentral chi-squared distribution.","image":"8c0cc9237ec72a1da6d18bc8e7fb24cdda43a49a.svg","url":"Chi-squared_distribution"}
