{"title":"Darboux frame","summary":"In the differential geometry of surfaces, a Darboux frame is a natural moving frame constructed on a surface.  It is the analog of the Frenetâ€“Serret frame as applied to surface geometry.  A Darboux frame exists at any non-umbilic point of a surface embedded in Euclidean space. It is named after French mathematician Jean Gaston Darboux.","image":"b400545538efeeedb55f6d5f5056c7ed2ffa8bdc.svg","url":"Darboux_frame"}
