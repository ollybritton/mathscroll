{"title":"Multilinear algebra","summary":"Multilinear algebra is a subfield of mathematics that extends the methods of linear algebra. Just as linear algebra builds on the concept of a vector and develops the theory of vector spaces, multilinear algebra builds on the concepts of p-vectors and multivectors with Grassmann algebras.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Multilinear_algebra"}
