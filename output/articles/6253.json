{"title":"Gieseking manifold","summary":"In mathematics, the Gieseking manifold is a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume.  It is non-orientable and has the smallest volume among non-compact hyperbolic manifolds, having volume approximately V ≈ 1.0149416 {\\displaystyle V\\approx 1.0149416} .  It was discovered by Hugo Gieseking (1912). The volume is called Gieseking constant and has a closed-form,","image":"722474e5e4b99f89cf31aebbf3927284e7c574f5.svg","url":"Gieseking_manifold"}
