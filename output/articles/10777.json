{"title":"Multicanonical ensemble","summary":"In statistics and physics, multicanonical ensemble (also called multicanonical sampling or flat histogram) is a  Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling technique that uses the Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm to compute integrals where the integrand has a rough landscape with multiple local minima. It samples states according to the inverse of the density of states,[1] which has to be known a priori or be computed using other techniques like the Wang and Landau algorithm.[2] Multicanonical sampling is an important technique for spin systems like the Ising model or spin glasses.[1][3][4]","image":"cab8a8badc55ad26f3f33e6e3a1cf6e22a7216b4.svg","url":"Multicanonical_ensemble"}
