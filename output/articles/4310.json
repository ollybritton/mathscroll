{"title":"Distributed constraint optimization","summary":"Distributed constraint optimization (DCOP or DisCOP) is the distributed analogue to constraint optimization.  A DCOP is a problem in which a group of agents must distributedly choose values for a set of variables such that the cost of a set of constraints over the variables is minimized.","image":"4159233e269f0c6acf7469b9b29c7e101f4507ca.svg","url":"Distributed_constraint_optimization"}
