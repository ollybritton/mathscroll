{"title":"Almost everywhere","summary":"In measure theory (a branch of mathematical analysis), a property holds almost everywhere if, in a technical sense, the set for which the property holds takes up nearly all possibilities. The notion of \"almost everywhere\" is a companion notion to the concept of measure zero, and is analogous to the notion of almost surely in probability theory.","image":"Rectangle_example.svg.png.webp","url":"Almost_everywhere"}
