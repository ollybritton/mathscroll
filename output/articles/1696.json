{"title":"Biregular graph","summary":"In graph-theoretic mathematics, a biregular graph[1] or semiregular bipartite graph[2] is a bipartite graph G = ( U , V , E ) {\\displaystyle G=(U,V,E)} for which every two vertices on the same side of the given bipartition have the same degree as each other. If the degree of the vertices in U {\\displaystyle U} is x {\\displaystyle x} and the degree of the vertices in V {\\displaystyle V} is y {\\displaystyle y} , then the graph is said to be ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle (x,y)} -biregular.","image":"9bc0b98e98b9111a77c95e1424c9a6576fc5689c.svg","url":"Biregular_graph"}
