{"title":"Monodomain model","summary":"The monodomain model is a reduction of the bidomain model of the electrical propagation in myocardial tissue. The reduction comes from assuming that the intra- and extracellular domains have equal anisotropy ratios. Although not as physiologically accurate as the bidomain model, it is still adequate in some cases, and has reduced complexity.[1]","image":"9c039979935c00b3b216cbb065999207872677f6.svg","url":"Monodomain_model"}
