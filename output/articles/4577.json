{"title":"EXPSPACE","summary":"In computational complexity theory, EXPSPACE is the set of all decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in exponential space, i.e., in O ( 2 p ( n ) ) {\\displaystyle O(2^{p(n)})} space, where p ( n ) {\\displaystyle p(n)} is a polynomial function of n {\\displaystyle n} . Some authors restrict p ( n ) {\\displaystyle p(n)} to be a linear function, but most authors instead call the resulting class ESPACE. If we use a nondeterministic machine instead, we get the class NEXPSPACE, which is equal to EXPSPACE by Savitch's theorem.","image":"eadef2538edcbdbc2faa0fad6724e00023321556.svg","url":"EXPSPACE"}
