{"title":"Noetherian ring","summary":"In mathematics, a Noetherian ring is a ring that satisfies the ascending chain condition on left and right ideals; if the chain condition is satisfied only for left ideals or for right ideals, then the ring is said left-Noetherian or right-Noetherian respectively. That is, every increasing sequence I 1 ⊆ I 2 ⊆ I 3 ⊆ ⋯ {\\displaystyle I_{1}\\subseteq I_{2}\\subseteq I_{3}\\subseteq \\cdots } of left (or right) ideals has a largest element; that is, there exists an n such that: I n = I n + 1 = ⋯ . {\\displaystyle I_{n}=I_{n+1}=\\cdots .}","image":"73d203ecbba4448e6b882af7e4fbef4ed109f3f1.svg","url":"Noetherian_ring"}
