{"title":"Cylinder set measure","summary":"In mathematics, cylinder set measure (or promeasure, or premeasure, or quasi-measure, or CSM) is a kind of prototype for a measure on an infinite-dimensional vector space. An example is the Gaussian cylinder set measure on Hilbert space.","image":"4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b.svg","url":"Cylinder_set_measure"}
