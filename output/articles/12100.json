{"title":"Petri net","summary":"A Petri net, also known as a place/transition (PT) net, is one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems.  It is a class of discrete event dynamic system. A Petri net is a directed bipartite graph that has two types of elements: places and transitions.  Place elements are depicted as white circles and transition elements are depicted as rectangles. A place can contain any number of tokens, depicted as black circles. A transition is enabled if all places connected to it as inputs contain at least one token. Some sources[1] state that Petri nets were invented in August 1939 by Carl Adam Petri—at the age of 13—for the purpose of describing chemical processes.","image":"Animated_Petri_net_commons.gif","url":"Petri_net"}
