{"title":"Group ring","summary":"In algebra, a group ring is a free module and at the same time a ring, constructed in a natural way from any given ring and any given group. As a free module, its ring of scalars is the given ring, and its basis is the set of elements of the given group. As a ring, its addition law is that of the free module and its multiplication extends \"by linearity\" the given group law on the basis. Less formally, a group ring is a generalization of a given group, by attaching to each element of the group a \"weighting factor\" from a given ring.","image":"619e6518cac7b1518f66326410c9d740ee861f69.svg","url":"Group_ring"}
