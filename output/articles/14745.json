{"title":"Spectral radius","summary":"In mathematics, the spectral radius of a square matrix is the maximum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues.[1] More generally, the spectral radius of a bounded linear operator is the supremum of the absolute values of the elements of its spectrum. The spectral radius is often denoted by ρ(·).","image":"61b0c999c62441fe1ba0b9d9417fa3be1fdab500.svg","url":"Spectral_radius"}
