{"title":"Hosoya index","summary":"The Hosoya index, also known as the Z index, of a graph is the total number of matchings in it. The Hosoya index is always at least one, because the empty set of edges is counted as a matching for this purpose. Equivalently, the Hosoya index is the number of non-empty matchings plus one. The index is named after Haruo Hosoya. It is used as a topological index in chemical graph theory.","image":"K4_matchings.svg.png.webp","url":"Hosoya_index"}
