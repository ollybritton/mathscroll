{"title":"GIT quotient","summary":"In algebraic geometry, an affine GIT quotient, or affine geometric invariant theory quotient, of an affine scheme X = Spec ⁡ A {\\displaystyle X=\\operatorname {Spec} A} with an action by a group scheme G is the affine scheme Spec ⁡ ( A G ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Spec} (A^{G})} , the prime spectrum of the ring of invariants of A, and is denoted by X / / G {\\displaystyle X/\\!/G} . A GIT quotient is a categorical quotient: any invariant morphism uniquely factors through it.","image":"729a50e2df83e0d1aaa004c24d5b445b65402b0a.svg","url":"GIT_quotient"}
