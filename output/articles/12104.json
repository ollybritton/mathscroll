{"title":"Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem","summary":"In geometry, the Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem (or the PDN-theorem) is a result concerning arbitrary planar polygons. The theorem asserts that a certain procedure when applied to an arbitrary polygon always yields a regular polygon having the same number of sides as the initial polygon. The theorem was first published by Karel Petr (1868–1950) of Prague in 1908.[1][2] The theorem was independently rediscovered by Jesse Douglas (1897–1965) in 1940[3] and also by B H Neumann (1909–2002) in 1941.[2][4]  The naming of the theorem as Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem, or as the PDN-theorem for short,  is due to Stephen B Gray.[2] This theorem has also been called Douglas's theorem, the Douglas–Neumann theorem, the Napoleon–Douglas–Neumann theorem  and Petr's theorem.[2]","image":"PDNTheoremForTriangle.svg.png.webp","url":"Petr–Douglas–Neumann_theorem"}
