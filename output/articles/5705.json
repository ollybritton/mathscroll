{"title":"Free-by-cyclic group","summary":"In group theory, especially, in geometric group theory, the class of free-by-cyclic groups have been deeply studied as important examples. A group G {\\displaystyle G} is said to be free-by-cyclic if it has a free normal subgroup F {\\displaystyle F} such that the quotient group G / F {\\displaystyle G/F} is cyclic. In other words, G {\\displaystyle G} is free-by-cyclic if it can be expressed as a group extension of a free group by a cyclic group (NB there are two conventions for 'by'). Usually, we assume F {\\displaystyle F} is finitely generated and the quotient is an infinite cyclic group. Equivalently, we can define a free-by-cyclic group constructively: if φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } is an automorphism of F {\\displaystyle F} , the semidirect product F ⋊ φ Z {\\displaystyle F\\rtimes _{\\varphi }\\mathbb {Z} } is a free-by-cyclic group.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Free-by-cyclic_group"}
