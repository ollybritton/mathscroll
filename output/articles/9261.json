{"title":"Lie algebra-valued differential form","summary":"In differential geometry, a Lie-algebra-valued form is a differential form with values in a Lie algebra. Such forms have important applications in the theory of connections on a principal bundle as well as in the theory of Cartan connections.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Lie_algebra-valued_differential_form"}
