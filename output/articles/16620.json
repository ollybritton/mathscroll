{"title":"Virtual knot","summary":"In knot theory, a virtual knot is a generalization of knots in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R3, to knots in thickened surfaces Σ × [ 0 , 1 ] {\\displaystyle \\Sigma \\times [0,1]} modulo an equivalence relation called stabilization/destabilization. Here Σ {\\displaystyle \\Sigma } is required to be closed and oriented. Virtual knots were first introduced by Kauffman (1999).","image":"8345a9efebafd1b3bb6f17e91eccdb0f479869e6.svg","url":"Virtual_knot"}
