{"title":"Bridge (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, a bridge, isthmus, cut-edge, or cut arc is an edge of a graph whose deletion increases the graph's number of connected components.[1] Equivalently, an edge is a bridge if and only if it is not contained in any cycle. For a connected graph, a bridge can uniquely determine a cut. A graph is said to be bridgeless or isthmus-free if it contains no bridges.","image":"Graph_cut_edges.svg.png.webp","url":"Bridge_(graph_theory)"}
