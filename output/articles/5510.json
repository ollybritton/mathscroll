{"title":"Fixed-point property","summary":"A mathematical object X has the fixed-point property if every suitably well-behaved mapping from X to itself has a fixed point. The term is most commonly used to describe topological spaces on which every continuous mapping has a fixed point.  But another use is in order theory, where a partially ordered set P is said to have the fixed point property if every increasing function on P has a fixed point.","image":"eb4c3b0de08168fb03bbbb9505cb1b192cff5866.svg","url":"Fixed-point_property"}
