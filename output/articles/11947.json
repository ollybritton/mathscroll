{"title":"Penrose transform","summary":"In theoretical physics, the Penrose transform, introduced by Roger PenroseÂ (1967, 1968, 1969), is a complex analogue of the Radon transform that relates massless fields on spacetime, or more precisely the space of solutions to massless field equations to sheaf cohomology groups on complex projective space.  The projective space in question is the twistor space, a geometrical space naturally associated to the original spacetime, and the twistor transform is also geometrically natural in the sense of integral geometry.  The Penrose transform is a major component of classical twistor theory.","image":"047526f71c13a0803702f403f836d8949b783838.svg","url":"Penrose_transform"}
