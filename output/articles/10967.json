{"title":"Near-field (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a near-field is an algebraic structure similar to a division ring, except that it has only one of the two distributive laws. Alternatively, a near-field is a near-ring in which there is a multiplicative identity and every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.","image":"8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed.svg","url":"Near-field_(mathematics)"}
