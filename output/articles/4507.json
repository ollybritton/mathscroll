{"title":"Duality gap","summary":"In optimization problems in applied mathematics, the duality gap is the difference between the primal and dual solutions.  If d ∗ {\\displaystyle d^{*}} is the optimal dual value and p ∗ {\\displaystyle p^{*}} is the optimal primal value then the duality gap is equal to p ∗ − d ∗ {\\displaystyle p^{*}-d^{*}} .  This value is always greater than or equal to 0 (for minimization problems).  The duality gap is zero if and only if strong duality holds.  Otherwise the gap is strictly positive and weak duality holds.[1]","image":"6de21e957a2d59bc958c7b842fd35f2b5277728e.svg","url":"Duality_gap"}
