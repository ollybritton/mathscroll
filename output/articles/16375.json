{"title":"Uniformization theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the uniformization theorem says that every simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of three Riemann surfaces: the open unit disk, the complex plane, or the Riemann sphere. The theorem is a generalization of the Riemann mapping theorem from simply connected open subsets of the plane to arbitrary simply connected Riemann surfaces.","image":"102416b229bdb308773ed725bb8c4e62d8eb9a86.svg","url":"Uniformization_theorem"}
