{"title":"Location–scale family","summary":"In probability theory, especially in mathematical statistics, a location–scale family is a family of probability distributions parametrized by a location parameter and a non-negative scale parameter. For any random variable X {\\displaystyle X} whose probability distribution function belongs to such a family, the distribution function of Y = d a + b X {\\displaystyle Y{\\stackrel {d}{=}}a+bX} also belongs to the family (where = d {\\displaystyle {\\stackrel {d}{=}}} means \"equal in distribution\"—that is, \"has the same distribution as\").","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Location–scale_family"}
