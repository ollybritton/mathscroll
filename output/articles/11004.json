{"title":"Nerve (category theory)","summary":"In category theory, a discipline within mathematics, the nerve N(C) of a small category C is a simplicial set constructed from the objects and morphisms of C. The geometric realization of this simplicial set is a topological space, called the classifying space of the category C. These closely related objects can provide information about some familiar and useful categories using algebraic topology, most often homotopy theory.","image":"Nerve-2-simplex.png.webp","url":"Nerve_(category_theory)"}
