{"title":"Dirichlet process","summary":"In probability theory, Dirichlet processes (after the distribution associated with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet) are a family of stochastic processes whose realizations are probability distributions. In other words, a Dirichlet process is a probability distribution whose range is itself a set of probability distributions. It is often used in Bayesian inference to describe the prior knowledge about the distribution of random variablesâ€”how likely it is that the random variables are distributed according to one or another particular distribution.","image":"Dirichlet_process_draws.svg.png.webp","url":"Dirichlet_process"}
