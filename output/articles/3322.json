{"title":"Continuous geometry","summary":"In mathematics, continuous geometry is an analogue of complex projective geometry introduced  by von Neumann (1936, 1998), where instead of the dimension of a subspace being in a discrete set 0 , 1 , … , n {\\displaystyle 0,1,\\dots ,{\\textit {n}}} , it can be an element of the unit interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\\displaystyle [0,1]} . Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of von Neumann algebras with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions, and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the projections of the hyperfinite type II factor.","image":"d1221be8beebcc8ebfc2bde462ab9b2574286a66.svg","url":"Continuous_geometry"}
