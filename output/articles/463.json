{"title":"Aitken's delta-squared process","summary":"In numerical analysis, Aitken's delta-squared process or Aitken extrapolation is a series acceleration method, used for accelerating the rate of convergence of a sequence. It is named after Alexander Aitken, who introduced this method in 1926.[1] Its early form was known to Seki Kōwa (end of 17th century) and was found for rectification of the circle, i.e. the calculation of π. It is most useful for accelerating the convergence of a sequence that is converging linearly.","image":"0a8fd0db458fb7bf54d80036ad3cee33e8f75ed1.svg","url":"Aitken's_delta-squared_process"}
