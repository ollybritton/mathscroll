{"title":"Wave surface","summary":"In mathematics, Fresnel's wave surface, found by Augustin-Jean Fresnel in 1822, is a quartic surface describing the propagation of light in an optically biaxial crystal. Wave surfaces are special cases of tetrahedroids which are in turn special cases of  Kummer surfaces.","image":"6623a18b47e40f75d729d7ffc05b340685c4965e.svg","url":"Wave_surface"}
