{"title":"Wild arc","summary":"In geometric topology, a wild arc is an embedding of the unit interval into 3-dimensional space not equivalent to the usual one in the sense that there does not exist an ambient isotopy taking the arc to a straight line segment.  Antoine (1920) found the first example of a wild arc,  and Fox & Artin (1948) found another example called the Fox-Artin arc whose complement is not simply connected.","image":"Fox-Artin_(large).png.webp","url":"Wild_arc"}
