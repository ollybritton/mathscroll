{"title":"UTM theorem","summary":"In computability theory, the UTM theorem, or universal Turing machine theorem, is a basic result about GÃ¶del numberings of the set of computable functions. It affirms the existence of a computable universal function, which is capable of calculating any other computable function.[1] The universal function is an abstract version of the universal Turing machine, thus the name of the theorem.","image":"a509d1da943c92fedc9794dbd8a5b282ea77507e.svg","url":"UTM_theorem"}
