{"title":"Eleny Ionel","summary":"Eleny-Nicoleta Ionel is a Romanian mathematician whose research concerns symplectic geometry, including the study of the Gromov–Witten invariants and Gopakumar–Vafa invariant.  Among her most significant results are the construction of relative Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic manifolds, and the proof of the vanishing in codimension at least g of the tautological ring of the moduli space of genus-g curves.","image":"614b35a0d2988c7dd1908d082be3804b2e9a33f8.svg","url":"Eleny_Ionel"}
