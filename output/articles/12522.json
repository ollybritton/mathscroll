{"title":"Principal ideal theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the principal ideal theorem of class field theory, a branch of algebraic number theory, says that extending ideals gives a mapping on the class group of an algebraic number field to the class group of its Hilbert class field, which sends all ideal classes to the class of a principal ideal. The phenomenon has also been called principalization, or sometimes capitulation.","image":"a765972bf993594f0f17e173456d413cfba214b2.svg","url":"Principal_ideal_theorem"}
