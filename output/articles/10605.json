{"title":"Module (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a module is a generalization of the notion of vector space in which the field of scalars is replaced by a ring. The concept of module generalizes also the notion of abelian group, since the abelian groups are exactly the modules over the ring of integers.","image":"Latex_integers.svg.png.webp","url":"Module_(mathematics)"}
