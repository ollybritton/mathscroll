{"title":"Stirling numbers of the first kind","summary":"In mathematics, especially in combinatorics, Stirling numbers of the first kind arise in the study of permutations.  In particular, the Stirling numbers of the first kind count permutations according to their number of cycles (counting fixed points as cycles of length one).","image":"a462712cd2a4765947d2ca485db7b9d86cdc370f.svg","url":"Stirling_numbers_of_the_first_kind"}
