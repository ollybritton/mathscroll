{"title":"Birth窶電eath process","summary":"The birth窶電eath process (or birth-and-death process) is a special case of continuous-time Markov process where the state transitions are of only two types: \"births\", which increase the state variable by one and \"deaths\", which decrease the state by one. It was introduced by William Feller. [1]  The model's name comes from a common application, the use of such models to represent the current size of a population where the transitions are literal births and deaths. Birth窶電eath processes have many applications in demography, queueing theory, performance engineering, epidemiology, biology and other areas. They may be used, for example, to study the evolution of bacteria, the number of people with a disease within a population, or the number of customers in line at the supermarket.","image":"3cc700926a4e32fcddc673b6ddee97a51714bbda.svg","url":"Birth窶電eath_process"}
