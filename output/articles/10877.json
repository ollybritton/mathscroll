{"title":"Möbius–Kantor polygon","summary":"In geometry, the Möbius–Kantor polygon is a regular complex polygon 3{3}3, , in C 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{2}} . 3{3}3 has 8 vertices, and 8 edges. It is self-dual. Every vertex is shared by 3 triangular edges.[1] Coxeter named it a Möbius–Kantor polygon for sharing the complex configuration structure as the Möbius–Kantor configuration, (83).[2]","image":"CDel_3node_1.png.webp","url":"Möbius–Kantor_polygon"}
