{"title":"Superior highly composite number","summary":"In mathematics, a superior highly composite number is a natural number which, in a particular rigorous sense, has many divisors. Particularly, it's defined by a ratio between the number of divisors an integer has and that integer raised to some positive power. For any possible exponent, whichever integer has the highest ratio is a superior highly composite number. It is a stronger restriction than that of a highly composite number, which is defined as having more divisors than any smaller positive integer.","image":"Divisor.svg.png.webp","url":"Superior_highly_composite_number"}
