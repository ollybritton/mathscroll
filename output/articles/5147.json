{"title":"Exotic R4","summary":"In mathematics, an exotic R 4 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{4}} is a differentiable manifold that is homeomorphic (i.e. shape preserving) but not diffeomorphic (i.e. non smooth) to the Euclidean space R 4 . {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{4}.} The first examples were found in 1982 by Michael Freedman and others, by using the contrast between Freedman's theorems about topological 4-manifolds, and Simon Donaldson's theorems about smooth 4-manifolds.[1][2] There is a continuum of non-diffeomorphic differentiable structures of R 4 , {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{4},} as was shown first by Clifford Taubes.[3]","image":"e4abb9b9dab94f7b25a4210364f0f9032704bfb9.svg","url":"Exotic_R4"}
