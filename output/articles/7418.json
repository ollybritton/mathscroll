{"title":"Horocycle","summary":"In hyperbolic geometry, a horocycle (from Greek  ὅριον (hórion) 'border', and  κύκλος (kúklos) 'circle'), sometimes called an oricycle, oricircle, or limit circle, is a curve whose normal or perpendicular geodesics all converge asymptotically in the same direction. It is the two-dimensional case of a horosphere (or orisphere).","image":"Horocycle_normals.svg.png.webp","url":"Horocycle"}
