{"title":"Endomorphism ring","summary":"In mathematics, the endomorphisms of an abelian group X form a ring. This ring is called the endomorphism ring of X, denoted by End(X); the set of all homomorphisms of X into itself. Addition of endomorphisms arises naturally in a pointwise manner and multiplication via endomorphism composition.  Using these operations, the set of endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a (unital) ring, with the zero map 0 : x ↦ 0 {\\textstyle 0:x\\mapsto 0} as additive identity and the identity map 1 : x ↦ x {\\textstyle 1:x\\mapsto x} as multiplicative identity.[1][2]","image":"f28b14e4ef7ee91bdb78f39dff73920193f58c41.svg","url":"Endomorphism_ring"}
