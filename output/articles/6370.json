{"title":"Gomory–Hu tree","summary":"In combinatorial optimization, the Gomory–Hu tree[1] of an undirected graph with capacities is a weighted tree that represents the minimum s-t cuts for all s-t pairs in the graph. The Gomory–Hu tree can be constructed in |V| − 1 maximum flow computations.","image":"Gomory–Hu_G.svg.png.webp","url":"Gomory–Hu_tree"}
