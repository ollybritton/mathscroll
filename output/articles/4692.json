{"title":"Einstein notation","summary":"In mathematics, especially the usage of linear algebra in mathematical physics, Einstein notation (also known as the  Einstein summation convention or Einstein summation notation) is a notational convention that implies summation over a set of indexed terms in a formula, thus achieving brevity. As part of mathematics it is a notational subset of Ricci calculus; however, it is often used in physics applications that do not distinguish between tangent and cotangent spaces. It was introduced to physics by Albert Einstein in 1916.[1]","image":"d1c4d40cbd9eedd4606d5eaba7ae11bcf1e81ed4.svg","url":"Einstein_notation"}
