{"title":"Knuth–Bendix completion algorithm","summary":"The Knuth–Bendix completion algorithm (named after Donald Knuth and Peter Bendix[1]) is a semi-decision[2][3] algorithm for transforming a set of equations (over terms) into a confluent term rewriting system.  When the algorithm succeeds, it effectively solves the word problem for the specified algebra.","image":"caba58cca4130a1982a82152979d2e991025307f.svg","url":"Knuth–Bendix_completion_algorithm"}
