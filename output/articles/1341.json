{"title":"Bartlett's test","summary":"In statistics, Bartlett's test, named after Maurice Stevenson Bartlett,[1] is used to test homoscedasticity, that is, if multiple samples are from populations with equal variances.[2] Some statistical tests, such as the analysis of variance, assume that variances are equal across groups or samples, which can be verified with Bartlett's test.","image":"57f87f905ba5a4d8c691ccaecd65fc47bd007ba4.svg","url":"Bartlett's_test"}
