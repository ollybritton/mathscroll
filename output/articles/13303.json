{"title":"Regular cardinal","summary":"In set theory, a regular cardinal is a  cardinal number that is equal to its own cofinality.  More explicitly, this means that κ {\\displaystyle \\kappa } is a regular cardinal if and only if every unbounded subset C ⊆ κ {\\displaystyle C\\subseteq \\kappa } has cardinality κ {\\displaystyle \\kappa } .  Infinite well-ordered cardinals that are not regular are called singular cardinals. Finite cardinal numbers are typically not called regular or singular.","image":"54ddec2e922c5caea4e47d04feef86e782dc8e6d.svg","url":"Regular_cardinal"}
