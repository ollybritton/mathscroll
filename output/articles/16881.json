{"title":"Whitehead manifold","summary":"In mathematics, the Whitehead manifold is an open 3-manifold that is contractible, but not homeomorphic to R 3 . {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}.} J. H. C. Whitehead (1935) discovered this puzzling object while he was trying to prove the Poincaré conjecture, correcting an error in an earlier paper Whitehead (1934, theorem 3) where he incorrectly claimed that no such manifold exists.","image":"b00b2b4fd27c2cbffa02df568472f77b194a6db9.svg","url":"Whitehead_manifold"}
