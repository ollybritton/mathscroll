{"title":"G2 manifold","summary":"In differential geometry, a G2 manifold is a seven-dimensional Riemannian manifold with holonomy group contained in G2. The group G 2 {\\displaystyle G_{2}} is one of the five exceptional simple Lie groups. It can be described as the automorphism group of the octonions, or equivalently, as a proper subgroup of special orthogonal group SO(7) that preserves a spinor in the eight-dimensional spinor representation or lastly as the subgroup of the general linear group GL(7) which preserves the non-degenerate 3-form ϕ {\\displaystyle \\phi } , the associative form. The Hodge dual, ψ = ∗ ϕ {\\displaystyle \\psi =*\\phi } is then a parallel 4-form, the coassociative form. These forms are calibrations in the sense of Reese Harvey and H. Blaine Lawson,[1] and thus define special classes of 3- and 4-dimensional submanifolds.","image":"645011b0c6933a02f5f7d84624f78220d747427e.svg","url":"G2_manifold"}
