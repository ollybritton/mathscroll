{"title":"Mathematical economics","summary":"Mathematical economics is the application of mathematical methods to represent theories and analyze problems in economics.  Often, these applied methods are beyond simple geometry, and may include differential and integral calculus, difference and differential equations, matrix algebra, mathematical programming, or other computational methods.[1][2] Proponents of this approach claim that it allows the formulation of theoretical relationships with rigor, generality, and simplicity.[3]","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp","url":"Mathematical_economics"}
