{"title":"Lusin's theorem","summary":"In the mathematical field of real analysis, Lusin's theorem (or Luzin's theorem, named for Nikolai Luzin) or Lusin's criterion states that an almost-everywhere finite function is measurable if and only if it is a continuous function on nearly all its domain. In the informal formulation of J. E. Littlewood, \"every measurable function is nearly continuous\".","image":"808e07bf306bb74c974003e5e32cd5dc306fd093.svg","url":"Lusin's_theorem"}
