{"title":"Bernstein's theorem (polynomials)","summary":"Bernstein's theorem is an inequality relating the maximum modulus of a complex polynomial function on the unit disk with the maximum modulus of its derivative on the unit disk. It was proven by Sergei Bernstein while he was working on approximation theory.[1]","image":"d5aaf40b92ad5f8b2c2346b55460b7f2b40193eb.svg","url":"Bernstein's_theorem_(polynomials)"}
