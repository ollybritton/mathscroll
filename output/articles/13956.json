{"title":"Schoof–Elkies–Atkin algorithm","summary":"The Schoof–Elkies–Atkin algorithm (SEA) is an algorithm used for finding the order of or calculating the number of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field. Its primary application is in elliptic curve cryptography. The algorithm is an extension of Schoof's algorithm by Noam Elkies and A. O. L. Atkin to significantly improve its efficiency (under heuristic assumptions).","image":"fd76e544e1240e24b65c9a0ab4a02f122a81883e.svg","url":"Schoof–Elkies–Atkin_algorithm"}
