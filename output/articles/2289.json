{"title":"Cartesian monoidal category","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in the field known as category theory, a monoidal category where the monoidal (\"tensor\") product is the categorical product is called a cartesian monoidal category. Any category with finite products (a \"finite product category\") can be thought of as a cartesian monoidal category. In any cartesian monoidal category, the terminal object is the monoidal unit. Dually, a monoidal finite coproduct category with the monoidal structure given by the coproduct and unit the initial object is called a cocartesian monoidal category, and any finite coproduct category can be thought of as a cocartesian monoidal category.","image":"6322e6cc4a02925100882637f1cb9629394c9d58.svg","url":"Cartesian_monoidal_category"}
