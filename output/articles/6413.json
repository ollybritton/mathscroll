{"title":"Graded ring","summary":"In mathematics, in particular abstract algebra, a graded ring is a ring such that the underlying additive group is a direct sum of abelian groups R i {\\displaystyle R_{i}} such that R i R j âŠ† R i + j {\\displaystyle R_{i}R_{j}\\subseteq R_{i+j}} . The index set is usually the set of nonnegative integers or the set of integers, but can be any monoid. The direct sum decomposition is usually referred to as gradation or grading.","image":"db421291be9d0103404ced7495b363437b67b6b1.svg","url":"Graded_ring"}
