{"title":"Mathematical game","summary":"A mathematical game is a game whose rules, strategies, and outcomes are defined by clear mathematical parameters.[1] Often, such games have simple rules and match procedures, such as tic-tac-toe and dots and boxes. Generally, mathematical games need not be conceptually intricate to involve deeper computational underpinnings. For example, even though the rules of Mancala are relatively basic, the game can be rigorously analyzed through the lens of combinatorial game theory.","image":"People_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Mathematical_game"}
