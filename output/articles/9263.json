{"title":"Lie algebra cohomology","summary":"In mathematics, Lie algebra cohomology is a cohomology theory for Lie algebras. It was first introduced in 1929 by Élie Cartan to study the topology of Lie groups and homogeneous spaces[1] by relating cohomological methods of Georges de Rham to properties of the Lie algebra. It was later extended by Claude Chevalley and Samuel Eilenberg (1948) to coefficients in an arbitrary Lie module.[2]","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Lie_algebra_cohomology"}
