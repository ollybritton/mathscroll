{"title":"Saddle point","summary":"In mathematics, a saddle point or minimax point[1] is a point on the surface of the graph of a function where the slopes (derivatives) in orthogonal directions are all zero (a critical point), but which is not a local extremum of the function.[2]  An example of a saddle point is when there is a critical point with a relative minimum along one axial direction (between peaks) and at a relative maximum along the crossing axis.  However, a saddle point need not be in this form.  For example, the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 3 {\\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{3}} has a critical point at ( 0 , 0 ) {\\displaystyle (0,0)} that is a saddle point since it is neither a relative maximum nor relative minimum, but it does not have a relative maximum or relative minimum in the y {\\displaystyle y} -direction.","image":"10f495e0036715bf53be1d3ba382a207e4327093.svg","url":"Saddle_point"}
