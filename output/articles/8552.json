{"title":"k shortest path routing","summary":"The k shortest path routing problem is a generalization of the shortest path routing problem in a given network. It asks not only about a shortest path but also about next kâˆ’1 shortest paths (which may be longer than the shortest path). A variation of the problem is the loopless k shortest paths.","image":"15-node_network_containing_a_combination_of_bi-directional_and_uni-directional_links.png.webp","url":"K_shortest_path_routing"}
