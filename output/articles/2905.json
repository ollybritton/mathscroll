{"title":"Commensurability (group theory)","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in group theory, two groups are commensurable if they differ only by a finite amount, in a precise sense. The commensurator of a subgroup is another subgroup, related to the normalizer.","image":"64e735c526395c23dc4b8934d8cd8671d820082c.svg","url":"Commensurability_(group_theory)"}
