{"title":"Dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, a dodecahedron (Greek δωδεκάεδρον, from δώδεκα dōdeka \"twelve\" + ἕδρα hédra \"base\", \"seat\" or \"face\") or duodecahedron[1] is any polyhedron  with twelve flat faces. The most familiar dodecahedron is the regular dodecahedron with regular pentagons as faces, which is a Platonic solid. There are also three regular star dodecahedra, which are constructed as stellations of the convex form. All of these have icosahedral symmetry, order 120.","image":"Dodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Dodecahedron"}
