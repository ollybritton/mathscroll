{"title":"Knight's tour","summary":"A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant); otherwise, it is open.[1][2]","image":"Knight's_tour_anim_2.gif","url":"Knight's_tour"}
