{"title":"Line element","summary":"In geometry, the line element or length element can be informally thought of as a line segment associated with an infinitesimal displacement vector in a metric space. The length of the line element, which may be thought of as a differential arc length, is a function of the metric tensor and is denoted by d s {\\displaystyle ds} .","image":"5f0fb36e4308227d3e4a1f809c2571ec02527100.svg","url":"Line_element"}
