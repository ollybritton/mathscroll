{"title":"Extendible cardinal","summary":"In mathematics, extendible cardinals are large cardinals introduced by Reinhardt (1974), who was partly motivated by reflection principles.  Intuitively, such a cardinal represents a point beyond which initial pieces of the universe of sets start to look similar, in the sense that each is elementarily embeddable into a later one.","image":"54ddec2e922c5caea4e47d04feef86e782dc8e6d.svg","url":"Extendible_cardinal"}
