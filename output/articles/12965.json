{"title":"Queen's graph","summary":"In mathematics, a queen's graph is a graph that represents all legal moves of the queen—a chess piece—on a chessboard. In the graph, each vertex represents a square on a chessboard, and each edge is a legal move the queen can make, that is, a horizontal, vertical or diagonal move by any number of squares. If the chessboard has dimensions m × n {\\displaystyle m\\times n} , then the induced graph is called the m × n {\\displaystyle m\\times n} queen's graph.","image":"12b23d207d23dd430b93320539abbb0bde84870d.svg","url":"Queen's_graph"}
