{"title":"Triaugmented triangular prism","summary":"The triaugmented triangular prism, in geometry, is a convex polyhedron with 14 equilateral triangles as its faces. It can be constructed from a triangular prism by attaching equilateral square pyramids to each of its three square faces. The same shape is also called the tetrakis triangular prism,[1] tricapped trigonal prism,[2] tetracaidecadeltahedron,[3][4] or tetrakaidecadeltahedron;[1] these last names mean a polyhedron with 14 triangular faces. It is an example of a deltahedron and of a Johnson solid.","image":"Triaugmented_triangular_prism_(symmetric_view).svg.png.webp","url":"Triaugmented_triangular_prism"}
