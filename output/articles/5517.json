{"title":"Flag algebra","summary":"Flag algebras are an important computational tool in the field of graph theory which have a wide range of applications in homomorphism density and related topics. Roughly, they formalize the notion of adding and multiplying homomorphism densities and set up a framework to solve graph homomorphism inequalities with computers by reducing them to semidefinite programming problems. Originally introduced by Alexander Razborov in a 2007 paper,[1] the method has since come to solve numerous difficult, previously unresolved graph theoretic questions. These include the D 2 , 3 {\\displaystyle D_{2,3}} question regarding the region of feasible edge density, triangle density pairs and the maximum number of pentagons in triangle free graphs.[2]","image":"87d2b9d4164b4c3fcfc39d06049c054060e49a29.svg","url":"Flag_algebra"}
