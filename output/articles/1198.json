{"title":"Axiom of infinity","summary":"In axiomatic set theory and the branches of mathematics and philosophy that use it, the axiom of infinity is one of the axioms of Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory.  It guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, namely a set containing the natural numbers. It was first published by Ernst Zermelo as part of his set theory in 1908.[1]","image":"e2d866a2b812cbd6f5e1e1709ee1585b2269bb83.svg","url":"Axiom_of_infinity"}
