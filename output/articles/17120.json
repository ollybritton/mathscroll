{"title":"Z function","summary":"In mathematics, the Z function is a function used for studying the Riemann zeta function along the critical line where the argument is one-half. It is also called the Riemann–Siegel Z function, the Riemann–Siegel zeta function, the Hardy function, the Hardy Z function and  the Hardy zeta function. It can be defined in terms of the Riemann–Siegel theta function and the Riemann zeta function by","image":"2cf838967176f1f069d0c1433d9c0c153da26341.svg","url":"Z_function"}
