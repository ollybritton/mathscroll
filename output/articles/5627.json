{"title":"Fractal-generating software","summary":"Fractal-generating software is any type of graphics software that generates images of fractals. There are many fractal generating programs available, both free and commercial. Mobile apps are available to play or tinker with fractals. Some programmers create fractal software for themselves because of the novelty and because of the challenge in understanding the related mathematics.  The generation of fractals has led to some very large problems for pure mathematics.[1]","image":"Fragmentarium.png.webp","url":"Fractal-generating_software"}
