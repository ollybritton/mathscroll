{"title":"Wythoff array","summary":"In mathematics, the Wythoff array is an infinite matrix of integers derived from the Fibonacci sequence and named after Dutch mathematician Willem Abraham Wythoff. Every positive integer occurs exactly once in the array, and every integer sequence defined by the Fibonacci recurrence can be derived by shifting a row of the array.","image":"5263b4f7334ad95ff33e904e349b9cc19695549b.svg","url":"Wythoff_array"}
