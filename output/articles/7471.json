{"title":"Huzita–Hatori axioms","summary":"The Huzita–Justin axioms or Huzita–Hatori axioms are a set of rules related to the mathematical principles of origami, describing the operations that can be made when folding a piece of paper. The axioms assume that the operations are completed on a plane (i.e. a perfect piece of paper), and that all folds are linear. These are not a minimal set of axioms but rather the complete set of possible single folds.","image":"Huzita_axiom_1.png.webp","url":"Huzita–Hatori_axioms"}
