{"title":"Hyperhomology","summary":"In homological algebra, the hyperhomology or hypercohomology ( H ∗ ( − ) , H ∗ ( − ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} _{*}(-),\\mathbb {H} ^{*}(-)} ) is a generalization of (co)homology functors which takes as input not objects in an abelian category A {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}} but instead chain complexes of objects, so objects in Ch ( A ) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Ch}}({\\mathcal {A}})} . It is a sort of cross between the derived functor cohomology of an object and the homology of a chain complex since hypercohomology corresponds to the derived global sections functor R ∗ Γ ( − ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} ^{*}\\Gamma (-)} .","image":"12853bf5bd889fdbdbab96f578af26fa5611e1d1.svg","url":"Hyperhomology"}
