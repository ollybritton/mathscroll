{"title":"Π01 class","summary":"In computability theory, a Π01 class is a subset of 2ω of a certain form. These classes are of interest as technical tools within recursion theory and effective descriptive set theory. They are also used in the application of recursion theory to other branches of mathematics (Cenzer 1999, p. 39).","image":"b0b3c0e79d8a5db977a9838be477eb3e30348937.svg","url":"Π01_class"}
