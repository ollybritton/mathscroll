{"title":"Abel's irreducibility theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Abel's irreducibility theorem, a field theory result described in 1829 by Niels Henrik Abel,[1] asserts that if ƒ(x) is a polynomial over a field F that shares a root with a polynomial g(x) that is  irreducible over F, then every root of g(x) is a root of ƒ(x). Equivalently, if ƒ(x) shares at least one root with g(x) then ƒ is divisible evenly by g(x), meaning that ƒ(x) can be factored as g(x)h(x) with h(x) also having coefficients in F.[2][3]","image":"b4afc1e27d418021bf10898eb44a7f5f315735ff.svg","url":"Abel's_irreducibility_theorem"}
