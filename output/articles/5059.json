{"title":"Euler's factorization method","summary":"Euler's factorization method is a technique for factoring a number by writing it as a sum of two squares in two different ways. For example the number 1000009 {\\displaystyle 1000009} can be written as 1000 2 + 3 2 {\\displaystyle 1000^{2}+3^{2}} or as 972 2 + 235 2 {\\displaystyle 972^{2}+235^{2}} and Euler's method gives the factorization 1000009 = 293 â‹… 3413 {\\displaystyle 1000009=293\\cdot 3413} .","image":"08b5ae9ca8ae584e75b2436afa5a5e7dba9e58ac.svg","url":"Euler's_factorization_method"}
