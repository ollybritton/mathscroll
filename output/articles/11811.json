{"title":"Pareto distribution","summary":"The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian civil engineer, economist, and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto[2] (Italian: [.mw-parser-output .tooltip-dotted{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}paˈreːto] US: /pəˈreɪtoʊ/ pə-RAY-toh),[3] is a power-law probability distribution that is used in description of social, quality control, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of observable phenomena; the principle originally applied to describing the distribution of wealth in a society, fitting the trend that a large portion of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population.[4][5] The Pareto principle or \"80-20 rule\" stating that 80% of outcomes are due to 20% of causes was named in honour of Pareto, but the concepts are distinct, and only Pareto distributions with shape value (α) of log45 ≈ 1.16 precisely reflect it. Empirical observation has shown that this 80-20 distribution fits a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena[6] and human activities.[7][8]","image":"Probability_density_function_of_Pareto_distribution.svg.png.webp","url":"Pareto_distribution"}
