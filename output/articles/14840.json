{"title":"Sprague–Grundy theorem","summary":"In combinatorial game theory, the Sprague–Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a one-heap game of nim, or to an infinite generalization of nim. It can therefore be represented as a natural number, the size of the heap in its equivalent game of nim, as an ordinal number in the infinite generalization, or alternatively as a nimber, the value of that one-heap game in an algebraic system whose addition operation combines multiple heaps to form a single equivalent heap in nim.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Sprague–Grundy_theorem"}
