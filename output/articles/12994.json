{"title":"Quotient space (topology)","summary":"In topology and related areas of mathematics, the quotient space of a topological space under a given equivalence relation is a new topological space constructed by endowing the quotient set of the original topological space with the quotient topology, that is, with the finest topology that makes continuous the canonical projection map (the function that maps points to their equivalence classes). In other words, a subset of a quotient space is open if and only if its preimage under the canonical projection map is open in the original topological space.","image":"Disk_to_Sphere_using_Quotient_Space.gif","url":"Quotient_space_(topology)"}
