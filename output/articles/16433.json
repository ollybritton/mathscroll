{"title":"Universal instantiation","summary":"In predicate logic, universal instantiation[1][2][3] (UI; also called universal specification or universal elimination, and sometimes confused with dictum de omni) is a valid rule of inference from a truth about each member of a class of individuals to the truth about a particular individual of that class. It is generally given as a quantification rule for the universal quantifier but it can also be encoded in an axiom schema. It is one of the basic principles used in quantification theory.","image":"1f0e013cdbf59ae0de99050d75ece9b775f06f7d.svg","url":"Universal_instantiation"}
