{"title":"Jorge Luis Borges and mathematics","summary":"Jorge Luis Borges and mathematics concerns several modern mathematical concepts found in certain essays and short stories of Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986), including concepts such as set theory, recursion, chaos theory, and infinite sequences,[1]  although Borges' strongest links to mathematics are through Georg Cantor's theory of infinite sets, outlined in \"The Doctrine of Cycles\" (La doctrina de los ciclos). Some of Borges' most popular works such as \"The Library of Babel\" (La Biblioteca de Babel), \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" (El Jardín de Senderos que se Bifurcan), \"The Aleph\" (El Aleph), an allusion to Cantor's use of the Hebrew letter aleph ( ℵ {\\displaystyle \\aleph } ) to denote cardinality of transfinite sets,[2] and \"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim\" (El acercamiento a Almotásim) illustrate his use of mathematics.","image":"306c55e6bc96d94db729ff5821c8f45a34c72bce.svg","url":"Jorge_Luis_Borges_and_mathematics"}
