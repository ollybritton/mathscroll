{"title":"Bunyakovsky conjecture","summary":"The Bunyakovsky conjecture (or Bouniakowsky conjecture) gives a criterion for a polynomial f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} in one variable with integer coefficients to give infinitely many prime values in the sequence f ( 1 ) , f ( 2 ) , f ( 3 ) , â€¦ . {\\displaystyle f(1),f(2),f(3),\\ldots .} It was stated in 1857 by the Russian mathematician Viktor Bunyakovsky.  The following three conditions are necessary for f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} to have the desired prime-producing property:","image":"202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074.svg","url":"Bunyakovsky_conjecture"}
