{"title":"Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular in mathematical analysis, the Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality is a result in the theory of Sobolev spaces that relates the L p {\\displaystyle L^{p}} -norms of different weak derivatives of a function through an interpolation inequality. The theorem is of particular importance in the framework of elliptic partial differential equations and was originally formulated by Emilio Gagliardo and Louis Nirenberg in 1958. The Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality has found numerous applications in the investigation of nonlinear partial differential equations, and has been generalized to fractional Sobolev spaces by Haim Brezis and Petru Mironescu in the late 2010s.","image":"cf2317aaca1ecee4b8ccf667bc1001059eae5850.svg","url":"Gagliardo–Nirenberg_interpolation_inequality"}
