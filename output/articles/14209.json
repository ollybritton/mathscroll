{"title":"Serre's modularity conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, Serre's modularity conjecture, introduced by Jean-Pierre SerreÂ (1975, 1987), states that an odd, irreducible, two-dimensional Galois representation over a finite field arises from a modular form. A stronger version of this conjecture specifies the weight and level of the modular form. The conjecture in the level 1 case was proved by Chandrashekhar Khare in 2005,[1] and a proof of the full conjecture was completed jointly by Khare and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger in 2008.[2]","image":"9be5e75c03c6735b51597a10e6e5c9185dbbde3d.svg","url":"Serre's_modularity_conjecture"}
