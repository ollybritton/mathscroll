{"title":"Senary","summary":"A senary (/ˈsiːnəri, ˈsɛnəri/) numeral system (also known as base-6, heximal, or seximal) has six as its base. It has been adopted independently by a small number of cultures. Like decimal, it is a semiprime, though it is unique as the product of the only two consecutive numbers that are both prime (2 and 3).  As six is a superior highly composite number, many of the arguments made in favor of the duodecimal system also apply to senary.","image":"1612b3c85ae54bab238e30f3dde047efcee08481.svg","url":"Senary"}
