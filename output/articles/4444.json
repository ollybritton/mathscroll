{"title":"Double counting (proof technique)","summary":"In combinatorics, double counting, also called counting in two ways, is a combinatorial proof technique for showing that two expressions are equal by demonstrating that they are two ways of counting the size of one set. In this technique, which van Lint & Wilson (2001) call \"one of the most important tools in combinatorics\",[1] one describes a finite set from two perspectives leading to two distinct expressions for the size of the set. Since both expressions equal the size of the same set, they equal each other.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Double_counting_(proof_technique)"}
