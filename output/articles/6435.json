{"title":"Graham–Rothschild theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Graham–Rothschild theorem is a theorem that applies Ramsey theory to combinatorics on words and combinatorial cubes. It is named after Ronald Graham and Bruce Lee Rothschild, who published its proof in 1971.[1] Through the work of Graham, Rothschild, and Klaus Leeb in 1972, it became part of the foundations of structural Ramsey theory.[2] A special case of the Graham–Rothschild theorem motivates the definition of Graham's number, a number that was popularized by Martin Gardner in Scientific American[3] and listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest number ever appearing in a mathematical proof.[4]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Graham–Rothschild_theorem"}
