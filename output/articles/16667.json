{"title":"Volterra operator","summary":"In mathematics, in the area of functional analysis and operator theory, the Volterra operator, named after Vito Volterra, is a bounded linear operator on the space L2[0,1] of complex-valued square-integrable functions on the interval [0,1]. On the subspace C[0,1] of continuous functions it represents indefinite integration. It is the operator corresponding to the Volterra integral equations.","image":"f449332fd3a0589720c61d046798105a275c8a75.svg","url":"Volterra_operator"}
