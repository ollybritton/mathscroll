{"title":"Arthur–Selberg trace formula","summary":"In mathematics, the Arthur–Selberg trace formula is a generalization of the Selberg trace formula from the group SL2 to arbitrary reductive groups over global fields, developed by James Arthur in a long series of papers from 1974 to 2003. It describes the character of the representation of G(A) on the discrete part L20(G(F)\\G(A)) of L2(G(F)\\G(A)) in terms of geometric data, where G is a reductive algebraic group defined over a global field F and A is the ring of adeles of F.","image":"4a31235620ebba122385e6af81216918a4ad54aa.svg","url":"Arthur–Selberg_trace_formula"}
