{"title":"Free matroid","summary":"In mathematics, the free matroid over a given ground-set E is the matroid in which the independent sets are all subsets of E.[1] It is a special case of a uniform matroid. The unique basis of this matroid is the ground-set itself, E. Among matroids on E, the free matroid on E has the most independent sets, the highest rank, and the fewest circuits.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Free_matroid"}
