{"title":"Projective frame","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in projective geometry, a projective frame or projective basis is a tuple of points in a projective space that can be used for defining homogeneous coordinates in this space. More precisely, in a projective space of dimension n, a projective frame is a n + 2-tuple of points such that no hyperplane contains n + 1 of them. A projective frame is sometimes called a simplex,[1] although a simplex in a space of dimension n has at most n + 1 vertices.","image":"398800fafbac541592c06b20a7ccfb3da9e8a771.svg","url":"Projective_frame"}
