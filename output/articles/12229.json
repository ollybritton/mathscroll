{"title":"Plücker embedding","summary":"In mathematics,  the Plücker map embeds the Grassmannian G r ( k , V ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} , whose elements are k-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space V, in a projective space, thereby realizing it as an algebraic variety. More precisely, the Plücker map embeds G r ( k , V ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} into the projectivization P ( Λ k V ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {P} (\\Lambda ^{k}V)} of the k {\\displaystyle k} -th exterior power of V {\\displaystyle V} . The image is algebraic, consisting of the intersection of a number of quadrics defined by the Plücker relations (see below).","image":"932e9ef9d4ea6b1839a6346b6c874689548826c9.svg","url":"Plücker_embedding"}
