{"title":"Seiberg–Witten theory","summary":"In theoretical physics, Seiberg–Witten theory is an N = 2 {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {N}}=2} supersymmetric gauge theory with an exact low-energy effective action (for massless degrees of freedom), of which the kinetic part coincides with the Kähler potential of the moduli space of vacua. Before taking the low-energy effective action, the theory is known as N = 2 {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {N}}=2} supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory, as the field content is a single N = 2 {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {N}}=2} vector supermultiplet, analogous to the field content of Yang–Mills theory being a single vector gauge field (in particle theory language) or connection (in geometric language).","image":"81f52d38c18106a1322d74903137ab9a0c87b4d8.svg","url":"Seiberg–Witten_theory"}
