{"title":"Computational statistics","summary":"Computational statistics, or statistical computing, is the bond between statistics and computer science. It means statistical methods that are enabled by using computational methods. It is the area of computational science (or scientific computing) specific to the mathematical science of statistics. This area is also developing rapidly, leading to calls that a broader concept of computing should be taught as part of general statistical education.[1]","image":"London_School_of_Economics_Statistics_Machine_Room_1964.jpg.webp","url":"Computational_statistics"}
