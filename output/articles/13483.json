{"title":"Rhombitrioctagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the rhombitrioctagonal tiling is a semiregular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. At each vertex of the tiling there is one triangle and one octagon, alternating between two squares. The tiling has Schl√§fli symbol rr{8,3}. It can be seen as constructed as a rectified trioctagonal tiling, r{8,3}, as well as an expanded octagonal tiling or expanded order-8 triangular tiling.","image":"H2-8-3-cantellated.svg.png.webp","url":"Rhombitrioctagonal_tiling"}
