{"title":"Arithmetic of abelian varieties","summary":"In mathematics, the arithmetic of abelian varieties is the study of the number theory of an abelian variety, or a family of abelian varieties. It goes back to the studies of Pierre de Fermat on what are now recognized as elliptic curves; and has become a very substantial area of arithmetic geometry both in terms of results and conjectures. Most of these can be posed for an abelian variety A over a number field K; or more generally (for global fields or more general finitely-generated rings or fields).","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Arithmetic_of_abelian_varieties"}
