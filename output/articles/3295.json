{"title":"Constructive set theory","summary":"Axiomatic constructive set theory is an approach to mathematical constructivism following the program of axiomatic set theory. The same first-order language with \" = {\\displaystyle =} \" and \" âˆˆ {\\displaystyle \\in } \" of classical set theory is usually used, so this is not to be confused with a constructive types approach. On the other hand, some constructive theories are indeed motivated by their interpretability in type theories.","image":"505a4ceef454c69dffd23792c84b90f488543743.svg","url":"Constructive_set_theory"}
