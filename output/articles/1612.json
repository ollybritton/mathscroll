{"title":"Biharmonic map","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a biharmonic map is a map between Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds which satisfies a certain fourth-order partial differential equation. A biharmonic submanifold refers to an embedding or immersion into a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold which is a biharmonic map when the domain is equipped with its induced metric. The problem of understanding biharmonic maps was posed by James Eells and Luc Lemaire in 1983.[1] The study of harmonic maps, of which the study of biharmonic maps is an outgrowth (any harmonic map is also a biharmonic map), had been (and remains) an active field of study for the previous twenty years.[2] A simple case of biharmonic maps is given by biharmonic functions.","image":"03e163c208457ad2c9afa48a6805828e18ecf83d.svg","url":"Biharmonic_map"}
