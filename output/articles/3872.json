{"title":"Dedekind number","summary":"In mathematics, the Dedekind numbers are a rapidly growing sequence of integers named after Richard Dedekind, who defined them in 1897. The Dedekind number M(n) counts the number of monotone boolean functions of n variables. Equivalently, it counts the number of antichains of subsets of an n-element set, the number of elements in a free distributive lattice with n generators, or the number of abstract simplicial complexes with n elements.","image":"Monotone_Boolean_functions_0%2C1%2C2%2C3.svg.png.webp","url":"Dedekind_number"}
