{"title":"Rouché's theorem","summary":"Rouché's theorem, named after Eugène Rouché, states that for any two  complex-valued functions f and g holomorphic inside some region K {\\displaystyle K} with closed contour ∂ K {\\displaystyle \\partial K} , if |g(z)| < |f(z)| on ∂ K {\\displaystyle \\partial K} , then f and f + g have the same number of zeros inside K {\\displaystyle K} , where each zero is counted as many times as its multiplicity. This theorem assumes that the contour ∂ K {\\displaystyle \\partial K} is simple, that is, without self-intersections. Rouché's theorem is an easy consequence of a stronger symmetric Rouché's theorem described below.","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Rouché's_theorem"}
