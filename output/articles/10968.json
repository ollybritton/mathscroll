{"title":"Near-miss Johnson solid","summary":"In geometry, a near-miss Johnson solid is a strictly convex polyhedron whose faces are close to being regular polygons but some or all of which are not precisely regular. Thus, it fails to meet the definition of a Johnson solid, a polyhedron whose faces are all regular, though it \"can often be physically constructed without noticing the discrepancy\" between its regular and irregular faces.[1] The precise number of near-misses depends on how closely the faces of such a polyhedron are required to approximate regular polygons.","image":"Associahedron.gif","url":"Near-miss_Johnson_solid"}
