{"title":"Recam치n's sequence","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, Recam치n's sequence[1][2] is a well known sequence defined by a recurrence relation. Because its elements are related to the previous elements in a straightforward way, they are often defined using recursion.","image":"Recam치n_Sequence_Visualisation.svg.png.webp","url":"Recam치n's_sequence"}
