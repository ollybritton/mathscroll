{"title":"Invariant decomposition","summary":"The invariant decomposition is a decomposition of the elements of Pin ( p , q , r ) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Pin}}(p,q,r)} groups into orthogonal commuting elements. It is also valid in their subgroups, e.g. orthogonal, pseudo-Euclidean, conformal, and classical groups. Because the elements of Pin groups are the composition of k {\\displaystyle k} oriented reflections, the invariant decomposition theorem reads","image":"8801b2ce6f149976111e7f9d05de5bf55547baa3.svg","url":"Invariant_decomposition"}
