{"title":"Derivator","summary":"In mathematics, derivators are a proposed framework[1][2]pg 190-195  for homological algebra giving a foundation for both abelian and non-abelian homological algebra and various generalizations of it. They were introduced to address the deficiencies of derived categories (such as the non-functoriality of the cone construction) and provide at the same time a language for homotopical algebra.","image":"18f33ef263e1fab42722bb5a4ddebe6522f3c489.svg","url":"Derivator"}
