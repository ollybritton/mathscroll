{"title":"BF model","summary":"The BF model or BF theory is a topological field, which when quantized, becomes a topological quantum field theory. BF stands for background field B and F, as can be seen below, are also the variables appearing in the Lagrangian of the theory, which is helpful as a mnemonic device.","image":"5b69670e0ab2f542ab907c5eb3f49cda4746ef41.svg","url":"BF_model"}
