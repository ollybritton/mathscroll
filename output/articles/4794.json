{"title":"Elongated triangular pyramid","summary":"In geometry, the elongated triangular pyramid is one of the Johnson solids (J7).  As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a tetrahedron by attaching a triangular prism to its base. Like any elongated pyramid, the resulting solid is topologically (but not geometrically) self-dual.","image":"Elongated_triangular_pyramid.png.webp","url":"Elongated_triangular_pyramid"}
