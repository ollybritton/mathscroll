{"title":"Inverse function rule","summary":"In calculus, the inverse function rule is a formula that expresses the derivative of the inverse of a bijective and differentiable function f in terms of the derivative of f. More precisely, if the inverse of f {\\displaystyle f} is denoted as f − 1 {\\displaystyle f^{-1}} , where f − 1 ( y ) = x {\\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)=x} if and only if f ( x ) = y {\\displaystyle f(x)=y} , then the inverse function rule is, in Lagrange's notation,","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Inverse_function_rule"}
