{"title":"Linear complex structure","summary":"In mathematics, a complex structure on a real vector space V is an automorphism of V that squares to the minus identity, âˆ’I. Such a structure on V allows one to define multiplication by complex scalars in a canonical fashion so as to regard V as a complex vector space.","image":"aff180f3f0b608e92f918e989920f3b74f207c05.svg","url":"Linear_complex_structure"}
