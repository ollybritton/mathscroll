{"title":"Minimal model program","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the minimal model program is part of the birational classification of algebraic varieties. Its goal is to construct a birational model of any complex projective variety which is as simple as possible. The subject has its origins in the classical birational geometry of surfaces studied by the Italian school, and is currently an active research area within algebraic geometry.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Minimal_model_program"}
