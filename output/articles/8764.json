{"title":"Knot (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a knot is an embedding of the circle S1 into three-dimensional Euclidean space, R3 (also known as E3).  Often two knots are considered equivalent if they are ambient isotopic, that is, if there exists a continuous deformation of R3 which takes one knot to the other.","image":"Knot_table.svg.png.webp","url":"Knot_(mathematics)"}
