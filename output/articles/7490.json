{"title":"Hyperbolic metric space","summary":"In mathematics, a hyperbolic metric space is a metric space satisfying certain metric relations (depending quantitatively on a nonnegative real number Î´) between points. The definition, introduced by Mikhael Gromov, generalizes the metric properties of classical hyperbolic geometry and of trees. Hyperbolicity is a large-scale property, and is very useful to the study of certain infinite groups called Gromov-hyperbolic groups.","image":"c5321cfa797202b3e1f8620663ff43c4660ea03a.svg","url":"Hyperbolic_metric_space"}
