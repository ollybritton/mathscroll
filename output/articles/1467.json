{"title":"Berger's isoembolic inequality","summary":"In mathematics, Berger's isoembolic inequality is a result in Riemannian geometry that gives a lower bound on the volume of a Riemannian manifold and also gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the manifold to be isometric to the m-dimensional sphere with its usual \"round\" metric. The theorem is named after the mathematician Marcel Berger, who derived it from an inequality proved by Jerry Kazdan.","image":"cb063aec73882d860e7b22cc3437537a78b18bac.svg","url":"Berger's_isoembolic_inequality"}
