{"title":"Theorem of Bertini","summary":"In mathematics, the theorem of Bertini is an existence and genericity theorem for smooth connected hyperplane sections for smooth projective varieties over algebraically closed fields, introduced by Eugenio Bertini. This is the simplest and broadest of the \"Bertini theorems\" applying to a linear system of divisors; simplest because there is no restriction on the characteristic of the underlying field, while the extensions require characteristic 0.[1][2]","image":"614b35a0d2988c7dd1908d082be3804b2e9a33f8.svg","url":"Theorem_of_Bertini"}
