{"title":"Pin group","summary":"In mathematics, the pin group is a certain subgroup of the Clifford algebra associated to a quadratic space. It maps 2-to-1 to the orthogonal group, just as the spin group maps 2-to-1 to the special orthogonal group.","image":"0a4fc060b181efc0730a7633597ba96a3215dbaa.svg","url":"Pin_group"}
