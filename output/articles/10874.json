{"title":"Möbius strip","summary":"In mathematics, a Möbius strip, Möbius band, or Möbius loop[lower-alpha 1] is a surface that can be formed by attaching the ends of a strip of paper together with a half-twist. As a mathematical object, it was discovered by Johann Benedict Listing and August Ferdinand Möbius in 1858, but it had already appeared in Roman mosaics from the third century CE. The Möbius strip is a non-orientable surface, meaning that within it one cannot consistently distinguish clockwise from counterclockwise turns. Every non-orientable surface contains a Möbius strip.","image":"Möbius_strip.jpg.webp","url":"Möbius_strip"}
