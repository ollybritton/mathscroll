{"title":"Practical number","summary":"In number theory, a practical number or panarithmic number[1] is a positive integer n {\\displaystyle n} such that all smaller positive integers can be represented as sums of distinct divisors of n {\\displaystyle n} . For example, 12 is a practical number because all the numbers from 1 to 11 can be expressed as sums of its divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: as well as these divisors themselves, we have 5 = 3 + 2, 7 = 6 + 1, 8 = 6 + 2, 9 = 6 + 3, 10 = 6 + 3 + 1, and 11 = 6 + 3 + 2.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Practical_number"}
