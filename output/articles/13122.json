{"title":"Rankin–Selberg method","summary":"In mathematics, the Rankin–Selberg method, introduced by (Rankin 1939) and Selberg (1940), also known as the theory of integral representations of L-functions, is a technique for directly constructing and analytically continuing several important examples of automorphic L-functions.  Some authors reserve the term for a special type of integral representation, namely those that involve an Eisenstein series.  It has been one of the most powerful techniques for studying the Langlands program.","image":"3d16deb23ea2d3ae8b2b95e0bb0221bceabc5548.svg","url":"Rankin–Selberg_method"}
