{"title":"Euler's rotation theorem","summary":"In geometry, Euler's rotation theorem states that, in three-dimensional space, any displacement of a rigid body such that a point on the rigid body remains fixed, is equivalent to a single rotation about some axis that runs through the  fixed point. It also means that the composition of two rotations is also a rotation. Therefore the set of rotations has a group structure, known as a rotation group.","image":"Euler_AxisAngle.png.webp","url":"Euler's_rotation_theorem"}
