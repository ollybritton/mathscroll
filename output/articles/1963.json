{"title":"Bregman divergence","summary":"In mathematics, specifically statistics and information geometry, a Bregman divergence or Bregman distance is a measure of difference between two points, defined in terms of a strictly convex function; they form an important class of divergences. When the points are interpreted as probability distributions – notably as either values of the parameter of a parametric model or as a data set of observed values – the resulting distance is a statistical distance. The most basic Bregman divergence is the squared Euclidean distance.","image":"8ea27b7e0e41804f1bef6a758dd9fb7d2e7f2fea.svg","url":"Bregman_divergence"}
