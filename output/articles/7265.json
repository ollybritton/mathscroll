{"title":"Hill's spherical vortex","summary":"Hill's spherical vortex is an exact solution of the Euler equations that is commonly used to model a vortex ring. The solution is also used to model the velocity distribution inside a spherical drop of one fluid moving at a constant velocity through another fluid at small Reynolds number.[1] The vortex is named after Micaiah John Muller Hill who discovered the exact solution in 1894.[2] The two-dimensional analogue of this vortex is the Lambâ€“Chaplygin dipole.","image":"b9e918fbb45350470ed9142d8ba0016fed78e130.svg","url":"Hill's_spherical_vortex"}
