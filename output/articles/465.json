{"title":"Akaike information criterion","summary":"The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is an estimator of prediction error and thereby relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data.[1][2][3] Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for model selection.","image":"c5914e99ad679b0a2d962ea00e6167a20ff0d4ce.svg","url":"Akaike_information_criterion"}
