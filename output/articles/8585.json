{"title":"Karamata's inequality","summary":"In mathematics, Karamata's inequality,[1] named after Jovan Karamata,[2] also known as the majorization inequality, is a theorem in elementary algebra for convex and concave real-valued functions, defined on an interval of the real line. It generalizes the discrete form of Jensen's inequality, and generalizes in turn to the concept of Schur-convex functions.","image":"fe8f6b3b36b6eaa87ee8c5a117c4b30cdd7a2602.svg","url":"Karamata's_inequality"}
