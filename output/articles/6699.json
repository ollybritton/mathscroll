{"title":"Gyroelongated square bipyramid","summary":"In geometry, the gyroelongated square bipyramid, heccaidecadeltahedron, or tetrakis square antiprism is one of the Johnson solids (J17). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating an octahedron (square bipyramid) by inserting a square antiprism between its congruent halves. It is one of the eight strictly-convex deltahedra.","image":"Gyroelongated_square_dipyramid.png.webp","url":"Gyroelongated_square_bipyramid"}
