{"title":"Fenchel–Moreau theorem","summary":"In convex analysis, the Fenchel–Moreau theorem (named after Werner Fenchel and Jean Jacques Moreau) or Fenchel biconjugation theorem (or just biconjugation theorem) is a theorem which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to be equal to its biconjugate.  This is in contrast to the general property that for any function f ∗ ∗ ≤ f {\\displaystyle f^{**}\\leq f} .[1][2]  This can be seen as a generalization of the bipolar theorem.[1]  It is used in duality theory to prove strong duality (via the perturbation function).","image":"9abc63cc52e03934908aa5d890d833b22fb87fc9.svg","url":"Fenchel–Moreau_theorem"}
