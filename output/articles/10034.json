{"title":"Material implication (rule of inference)","summary":"In propositional logic, material implication[1][2] is a valid rule of replacement that allows for a conditional statement to be replaced by a disjunction in which the antecedent is negated. The rule states that P implies Q is logically equivalent to not- P {\\displaystyle P} or Q {\\displaystyle Q} and that either form can replace the other in logical proofs. In other words, if P {\\displaystyle P} is true, then Q {\\displaystyle Q} must also be true, while if Q {\\displaystyle Q} is not true, then P {\\displaystyle P} cannot be true either; additionally, when P {\\displaystyle P} is not true, Q {\\displaystyle Q} may be either true or false.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Material_implication_(rule_of_inference)"}
