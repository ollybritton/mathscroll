{"title":"First and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory","summary":"In algebra, the first and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory concern the generators and the relations of the ring of invariants in the ring of polynomial functions for classical groups (roughly the first concerns the generators and the second the relations).[1] The theorems are among the most important results of invariant theory.","image":"4ad853a4ebab014e00fbd05a7a75beca186ed9a6.svg","url":"First_and_second_fundamental_theorems_of_invariant_theory"}
