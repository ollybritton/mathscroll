{"title":"Éléments de géométrie algébrique","summary":"The Éléments de géométrie algébrique (\"Elements of Algebraic Geometry\") by Alexander Grothendieck (assisted by Jean Dieudonné), or EGA for short, is a rigorous treatise, in French, on algebraic geometry that was published (in eight parts or fascicles) from 1960 through 1967 by the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques.  In it, Grothendieck established systematic foundations of algebraic geometry, building upon the concept of schemes, which he defined. The work is now considered the foundation stone and basic reference of modern algebraic geometry.","image":"Éléments_de_géométrie_algébrique_title_page.jpg.webp","url":"Éléments_de_géométrie_algébrique"}
