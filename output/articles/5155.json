{"title":"Expander mixing lemma","summary":"The expander mixing lemma intuitively states that the edges of certain d {\\displaystyle d} -regular graphs are evenly distributed throughout the graph. In particular, the number of edges between two vertex subsets S {\\displaystyle S} and T {\\displaystyle T} is always close to the expected number of edges between them in a random d {\\displaystyle d} -regular graph, namely d n | S | | T | {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d}{n}}|S||T|} .","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Expander_mixing_lemma"}
