{"title":"Quasirandom group","summary":"In mathematics, a quasirandom group is a group that does not contain a large product-free subset. Such groups are precisely those without a small non-trivial irreducible representation. The namesake of these groups stems from their connection to graph theory: bipartite Cayley graphs over any subset of a quasirandom group are always bipartite  quasirandom graphs.","image":"86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455.svg","url":"Quasirandom_group"}
