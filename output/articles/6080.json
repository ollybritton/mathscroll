{"title":"Generalized inverse","summary":"In mathematics, and in particular, algebra, a generalized inverse (or, g-inverse) of an element x is an element y that has some properties of an inverse element but not necessarily all of them. The purpose of constructing a generalized inverse of a matrix is to obtain a matrix that can serve as an inverse in some sense for a wider class of matrices than invertible matrices. Generalized inverses can be defined in any mathematical structure that involves associative multiplication, that is, in a semigroup.  This article describes generalized inverses of a matrix A {\\displaystyle A} .","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Generalized_inverse"}
