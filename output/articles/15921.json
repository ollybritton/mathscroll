{"title":"Totally positive matrix","summary":"In mathematics, a totally positive matrix is a square matrix in which all the minors are positive: that is, the determinant of every square submatrix is a positive number.[1]  A totally positive matrix has all entries positive, so it is also a positive matrix; and it has all principal minors positive (and positive eigenvalues). A symmetric totally positive matrix is therefore also positive-definite. A totally non-negative matrix is defined similarly, except that all the minors must be non-negative (positive or zero). Some authors use \"totally positive\" to include all totally non-negative matrices.","image":"0063ba3a82416e47556ed03183c3cd78716ba520.svg","url":"Totally_positive_matrix"}
