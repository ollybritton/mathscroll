{"title":"Discrete uniform distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the discrete uniform distribution is a symmetric probability distribution wherein a finite number of values are equally likely to be observed; every one of n values has equal probability 1/n. Another way of saying \"discrete uniform distribution\" would be \"a known, finite number of outcomes equally likely to happen\".","image":"Uniform_discrete_pmf_svg.svg.png.webp","url":"Discrete_uniform_distribution"}
