{"title":"Elements of Algebra","summary":"Elements of Algebra is an elementary mathematics textbook written by mathematician Leonhard Euler around 1765 in German. It was first published in Russian as \"Universal Arithmetic\" (Универсальная арифметика), two volumes appearing in 1768-9[1] and in 1770 was printed from the original text. Elements of Algebra is one of the earliest books to set out algebra in the modern form we would recognize today (another early book being Elements of Algebra by Nicholas Saunderson, published in 1740), and is one of Euler's few writings, along with Letters to a German Princess, that are accessible to the general public. Written in numbered paragraphs as was common practice till the 19th century, Elements begins with the definition of mathematics and builds on the fundamental operations of arithmetic and number systems, and gradually moves towards more abstract topics.","image":"page7-220px-Elements_of_algebra_(IA_elementsofalgebr00eule).pdf.jpg.webp","url":"Elements_of_Algebra"}
