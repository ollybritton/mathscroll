{"title":"N-transform","summary":"In mathematics, the Natural transform is an integral transform similar to the Laplace transform and Sumudu transform, introduced by Zafar Hayat Khan[1] in 2008. It converges to both Laplace and Sumudu transform just by changing variables. Given the convergence to the Laplace and Sumudu transforms, the N-transform inherits all the applied aspects of the both transforms. Most recently, F. B. M. Belgacem[2] has renamed it the natural transform and has proposed a detail theory and applications.[3][4]","image":"369258f5fa9c0ea578ca65469f7f1ad8bf458bf3.svg","url":"N-transform"}
