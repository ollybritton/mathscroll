{"title":"Poncelet–Steiner theorem","summary":"In the branch of mathematics known as Euclidean geometry, the Poncelet–Steiner theorem is one of several results concerning compass and straightedge constructions having additional restrictions imposed on the traditional rules. This result states that whatever can be constructed by straightedge and compass together can be constructed by straightedge alone, provided that a single circle and its centre are given. This theorem is related to the rusty compass equivalence.","image":"Steiner_construction_of_a_parallel_to_a_diameter.gif","url":"Poncelet–Steiner_theorem"}
