{"title":"Exponential integrator","summary":"Exponential integrators are a class of numerical methods for the solution of ordinary differential equations, specifically initial value problems.  This large class of methods from numerical analysis is based on the exact integration of the linear part of the initial value problem. Because the linear part is integrated exactly, this can help to mitigate the stiffness of a differential equation. Exponential integrators can be constructed to be explicit or implicit for numerical ordinary differential equations or serve as the time integrator for numerical partial differential equations.","image":"80faa85d7028aa577c113964b2ae9eefaaac6e44.svg","url":"Exponential_integrator"}
