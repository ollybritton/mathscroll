{"title":"Space hierarchy theorem","summary":"In computational complexity theory, the space hierarchy theorems are separation results that show that both deterministic and nondeterministic machines can solve more problems in (asymptotically) more space, subject to certain conditions. For example, a deterministic Turing machine can solve more decision problems in space n log n than in space n. The somewhat weaker analogous theorems for time are the time hierarchy theorems.","image":"d55aac32309dd529bc1a90f677c0054f5c3f7252.svg","url":"Space_hierarchy_theorem"}
