{"title":"Rep-tile","summary":"In the geometry of tessellations, a rep-tile or reptile is a shape that can be dissected into smaller copies of the same shape. The term was coined as a pun on animal reptiles by recreational mathematician Solomon W. Golomb and popularized by Martin Gardner in his \"Mathematical Games\" column in the May 1963 issue of Scientific American.[1] In 2012 a generalization of rep-tiles called self-tiling tile sets was introduced by Lee Sallows in Mathematics Magazine.[2]","image":"A_selection_of_rep-tiles.gif","url":"Rep-tile"}
