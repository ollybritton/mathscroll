{"title":"Multiple edges","summary":"In graph theory, multiple edges  (also called parallel edges or a multi-edge), are, in an undirected graph, two or more edges that are incident to the same two vertices, or in a directed graph, two or more edges with both the same tail vertex and the same head vertex. A simple graph has no multiple edges and no loops.","image":"Multiple_edges.png.webp","url":"Multiple_edges"}
