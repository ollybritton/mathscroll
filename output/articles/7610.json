{"title":"Ideal (order theory)","summary":"In mathematical order theory, an ideal is a special subset of a partially ordered set (poset). Although this term historically was derived from the notion of a ring ideal of abstract algebra, it has subsequently been generalized to a different notion. Ideals are of great importance for many constructions in order and lattice theory.","image":"ca8fe8855b84572c55012b0544255beb8d64b16a.svg","url":"Ideal_(order_theory)"}
