{"title":"Central product","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the field of group theory, the central product is one way of producing a group from two smaller groups.  The central product is similar to the direct product, but in the central product two isomorphic central subgroups of the smaller groups are merged into a single central subgroup of the product.  Central products are an important construction and can be used for instance to classify extraspecial groups.","image":"c4da93d5402dd51db2ca48ab8ad076f063efad82.svg","url":"Central_product"}
