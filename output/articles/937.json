{"title":"Arc (projective geometry)","summary":"An (simple) arc in finite projective geometry is a set of points which satisfies, in an intuitive way, a feature of curved figures in continuous geometries. Loosely speaking, they are sets of points that are far from \"line-like\" in a plane or far from \"plane-like\" in a three-dimensional space. In this finite setting it is typical to include the number of points in the set in the name, so these simple arcs are called k-arcs. An important generalization of the k-arc concept, also referred to as arcs in the literature, are the (k, d)-arcs.","image":"Hyperoval_in_Fano_plane.svg.png.webp","url":"Arc_(projective_geometry)"}
