{"title":"K-set (geometry)","summary":"In discrete geometry, a k {\\displaystyle k} -set of a finite point set S {\\displaystyle S} in the Euclidean plane is a subset of k {\\displaystyle k} elements of S {\\displaystyle S} that can be strictly separated from the remaining points by a line. More generally, in Euclidean space of higher dimensions, a k {\\displaystyle k} -set of a finite point set is a subset of k {\\displaystyle k} elements that can be separated from the remaining points by a hyperplane. In particular, when k = n / 2 {\\displaystyle k=n/2} (where n {\\displaystyle n} is the size of S {\\displaystyle S} ), the line or hyperplane that separates a k {\\displaystyle k} -set from the rest of S {\\displaystyle S} is a halving line or halving plane.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"K-set_(geometry)"}
