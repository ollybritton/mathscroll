{"title":"Motor variable","summary":"In mathematics, a function of a motor variable is a function with arguments and values in the split-complex number plane, much as functions of a complex variable involve ordinary complex numbers. William Kingdon Clifford coined the term motor for a kinematic operator in his \"Preliminary Sketch of Biquaternions\" (1873). He used split-complex numbers for scalars in his split-biquaternions. Motor variable is used here in place of split-complex variable for euphony and tradition.","image":"18f0c7e6cc3dd9ceced0820aaf6cea52d673d94f.svg","url":"Motor_variable"}
