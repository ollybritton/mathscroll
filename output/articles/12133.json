{"title":"Pi","summary":"The number π (/paɪ/; spelled out as \"pi\") is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159. The number π appears in many formulae across mathematics and physics. It is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of two integers, although fractions such as 22 7 {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {22}{7}}} are commonly used to approximate it. Consequently, its decimal representation never ends, nor enters a permanently repeating pattern. It is a transcendental number, meaning that it cannot be a solution of an equation involving only sums, products, powers, and integers. The transcendence of π implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge. The decimal digits of π appear to be randomly distributed,[lower-alpha 1] but no proof of this conjecture has been found.","image":"6cb5d075d03ff7edd66274d09cb1e2dd0aee7bc9.svg","url":"Pi"}
