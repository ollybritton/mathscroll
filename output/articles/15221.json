{"title":"Successive over-relaxation","summary":"In numerical linear algebra, the method of successive over-relaxation (SOR) is a variant of the Gaussâ€“Seidel method for solving a linear system of equations, resulting in faster convergence. A similar method can be used for any slowly converging iterative process.","image":"45d894430af69e29d6dda5aacbf4bb19336226a0.svg","url":"Successive_over-relaxation"}
