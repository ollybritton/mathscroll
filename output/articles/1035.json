{"title":"Arthur–Merlin protocol","summary":"In computational complexity theory, an Arthur–Merlin protocol, introduced by Babai (1985), is an interactive proof system in which the verifier's coin tosses are constrained to be public (i.e. known to the prover too). Goldwasser & Sipser (1986) proved that all (formal) languages with interactive proofs of arbitrary length with private coins also have interactive proofs with public coins.","image":"b379776529cf5982cc22d54dfee2242cde84c5e4.svg","url":"Arthur–Merlin_protocol"}
