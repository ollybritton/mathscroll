{"title":"Coxeter group","summary":"In mathematics, a Coxeter group, named after H. S. M. Coxeter, is an abstract group that admits a  formal description in terms of reflections (or kaleidoscopic mirrors). Indeed, the finite Coxeter groups are precisely the finite Euclidean reflection groups; the symmetry groups of regular polyhedra are an example.  However, not all Coxeter groups are finite, and not all can be described in terms of symmetries and Euclidean reflections. Coxeter groups were introduced in 1934 as abstractions of reflection groups (Coxeter 1934), and finite Coxeter groups were classified in 1935 (Coxeter 1935).","image":"d351823dfc3cc3241b16731504526e98d62bea2c.svg","url":"Coxeter_group"}
