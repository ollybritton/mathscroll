{"title":"Geometric transformation","summary":"In mathematics, a geometric transformation is any bijection of a set to itself (or to another such set) with some salient geometrical underpinning. More specifically, it is a function whose domain and range are sets of points — most often both R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} or both R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} — such that the function is bijective so that its inverse exists.[1] The study of geometry may be approached by the study of these transformations.[2]","image":"e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd.svg","url":"Geometric_transformation"}
