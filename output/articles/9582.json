{"title":"Littlewood polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, a Littlewood polynomial is a polynomial all of whose coefficients are +1 or âˆ’1. Littlewood's problem asks how large the values of such a polynomial must be on the unit circle in the complex plane.  The answer to this would yield information about the autocorrelation of binary sequences. They are named for J. E. Littlewood who studied them in the 1950s.","image":"Roots_of_Littlewood_polynomials_with_degree_15.png.webp","url":"Littlewood_polynomial"}
