{"title":"Low basis theorem","summary":"The low basis theorem is one of several basis theorems in computability theory, each of which showing that, given an infinite subtree of the binary tree 2 < ω {\\displaystyle 2^{<\\omega }} , it is possible to find an infinite path through the tree with particular computability properties. The low basis theorem, in particular, shows that there must be a path which is low; that is, the Turing jump of the path is Turing equivalent to the halting problem ∅ ′ {\\displaystyle \\emptyset '} .","image":"ded1a2a575f705db156ad55b898c26248adb1570.svg","url":"Low_basis_theorem"}
