{"title":"Perturbation function","summary":"In mathematical optimization, the perturbation function is any function which relates to primal and dual problems.  The name comes from the fact that any such function defines a perturbation of the initial problem.  In many cases this takes the form of shifting the constraints.[1]","image":"705702e3923dd25437b2d1935dec1079e06e3e2b.svg","url":"Perturbation_function"}
