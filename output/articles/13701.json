{"title":"Root of unity","summary":"In mathematics, a root of unity, occasionally called a de Moivre number, is any complex number that yields 1 when raised to some positive integer power n. Roots of unity are used in many branches of mathematics, and are especially important in number theory, the theory of group characters, and the discrete Fourier transform.","image":"One5Root.svg.png.webp","url":"Root_of_unity"}
