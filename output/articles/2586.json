{"title":"Choi's theorem on completely positive maps","summary":"In mathematics, Choi's theorem on completely positive maps is a result that classifies completely positive maps between finite-dimensional (matrix) C*-algebras. An infinite-dimensional algebraic generalization of Choi's theorem is known as Belavkin's \"Radonâ€“Nikodym\" theorem for completely positive maps.","image":"78a8cf42f466f56b4087d9fe2db5e40d180787d1.svg","url":"Choi's_theorem_on_completely_positive_maps"}
