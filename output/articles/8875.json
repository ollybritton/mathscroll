{"title":"Kummer surface","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a Kummer quartic surface, first studied by Ernst Kummer (1864), is an irreducible nodal surface of degree 4 in P 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} ^{3}} with the maximal possible number of 16 double points. Any such surface is the Kummer variety of the Jacobian variety of a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus 2; i.e. a quotient of the Jacobian by the Kummer involution x ↦ −x. The Kummer involution has 16 fixed points: the 16 2-torsion point of the Jacobian, and they are the 16 singular points of the quartic surface. Resolving the 16 double points of the quotient of a (possibly nonalgebraic) torus by the Kummer involution gives a K3 surface with 16 disjoint rational curves; these K3 surfaces are also sometimes called Kummer surfaces.","image":"7fb80175bc622b3936c7a0438fc690b2ec410b4f.svg","url":"Kummer_surface"}
