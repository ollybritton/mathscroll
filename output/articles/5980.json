{"title":"Gauss curvature flow","summary":"In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and geometric analysis, the Gauss curvature flow is a geometric flow for oriented hypersurfaces of Riemannian manifolds. In the case of curves in a two-dimensional manifold, it is identical with the curve shortening flow. The mean curvature flow is a different geometric flow which also has the curve shortening flow as a special case.","image":"ee033268224ac676f41e04c9fa10aa452d33da1f.svg","url":"Gauss_curvature_flow"}
