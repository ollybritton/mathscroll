{"title":"Conical function","summary":"In mathematics, conical functions or Mehler functions are functions which can be expressed in terms of Legendre functions of the first and second kind, P − ( 1 / 2 ) + i λ μ ( x ) {\\displaystyle P_{-(1/2)+i\\lambda }^{\\mu }(x)} and Q − ( 1 / 2 ) + i λ μ ( x ) . {\\displaystyle Q_{-(1/2)+i\\lambda }^{\\mu }(x).}","image":"f43d19e83b5e6bf00232bbaf44a700e2bb078928.svg","url":"Conical_function"}
