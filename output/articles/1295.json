{"title":"Banach function algebra","summary":"In functional analysis, a Banach function algebra on a compact Hausdorff space X is unital subalgebra, A, of the commutative C*-algebra  C(X) of all continuous, complex-valued functions from X, together with a norm on A that makes it a Banach algebra.","image":"65aa8d2f370727a799a1c413e553afad12518189.svg","url":"Banach_function_algebra"}
