{"title":"Order-4 octahedral honeycomb","summary":"The order-4 octahedral honeycomb is a regular paracompact honeycomb in hyperbolic 3-space. It is paracompact because it has infinite vertex figures, with all vertices as ideal points at infinity. Given by Schl√§fli symbol {3,4,4}, it has four ideal octahedra around each edge, and infinite octahedra around each vertex in a square tiling vertex figure.[1]","image":"H3_344_CC_center.png.webp","url":"Order-4_octahedral_honeycomb"}
