{"title":"Big q-Jacobi polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the big q-Jacobi polynomials  Pn(x;a,b,c;q), introduced by Andrews & Askey (1985), are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme. Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties.","image":"17f80ddd8b6ddcbbf4e32faef67a80210a05061b.svg","url":"Big_q-Jacobi_polynomials"}
