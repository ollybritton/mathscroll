{"title":"Anisohedral tiling","summary":"In geometry, a shape is said to be anisohedral if it admits a tiling, but no such tiling is isohedral (tile-transitive); that is, in any tiling by that shape there are two tiles that are not equivalent under any symmetry of the tiling.  A tiling by an anisohedral tile is referred to as an anisohedral tiling.[1]","image":"Heesch_anisohedral_tiling.svg.png.webp","url":"Anisohedral_tiling"}
