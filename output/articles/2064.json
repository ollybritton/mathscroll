{"title":"Burnside's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Burnside's theorem in group theory states that if G is a finite group of order p a q b {\\displaystyle p^{a}q^{b}} where p and q are prime numbers, and a and b are non-negative integers, then G is solvable. Hence each non-Abelian finite simple group has order divisible by at least three distinct primes.","image":"76ac37c7fa3549d0dbcf911667d60a79cd4b54c2.svg","url":"Burnside's_theorem"}
