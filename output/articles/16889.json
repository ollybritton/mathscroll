{"title":"Whitney covering lemma","summary":"In mathematical analysis, the Whitney covering lemma, or Whitney decomposition, asserts the existence of a certain type of partition of an open set in a Euclidean space.  Originally it was employed in the proof of Hassler Whitney's extension theorem.  The lemma was subsequently applied to prove generalizations of the Calderón–Zygmund decomposition.","image":"24b0d5ca6f381068d756f6337c08e0af9d1eeb6f.svg","url":"Whitney_covering_lemma"}
