{"title":"Matrix analysis","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra and applications, matrix analysis is the study of matrices and their algebraic properties.[1] Some particular topics out of many include; operations defined on matrices (such as matrix addition, matrix multiplication and operations derived from these), functions of matrices (such as matrix exponentiation and matrix logarithm, and even sines and cosines etc. of matrices), and the eigenvalues of matrices (eigendecomposition of a matrix, eigenvalue perturbation theory).[2]","image":"c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a.svg","url":"Matrix_analysis"}
