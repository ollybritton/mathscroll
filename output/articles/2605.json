{"title":"Chowla–Selberg formula","summary":"In mathematics, the Chowla–Selberg formula is the evaluation of a certain product of values of the gamma function at rational values in terms of values of the Dedekind eta function at imaginary quadratic irrational numbers. The result was essentially found by Lerch (1897) and rediscovered by Chowla and  Selberg (1949, 1967).","image":"15d54a1438b1f3c187e08e8aee926746c8e8eeae.svg","url":"Chowla–Selberg_formula"}
