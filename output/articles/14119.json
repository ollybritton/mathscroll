{"title":"Semiconductor luminescence equations","summary":"The semiconductor luminescence equations (SLEs)[1][2] describe luminescence of semiconductors resulting from spontaneous recombination of electronic excitations, producing a flux of spontaneously emitted light. This description established the first step toward semiconductor quantum optics because the SLEs simultaneously includes the quantized lightâ€“matter interaction and the Coulomb-interaction coupling among electronic excitations within a semiconductor. The SLEs are one of the most accurate methods to describe light emission in semiconductors and they are suited for a systematic modeling of semiconductor emission ranging from excitonic luminescence to lasers.","image":"48eff443f9de7a985bb94ca3bde20813ea737be8.svg","url":"Semiconductor_luminescence_equations"}
