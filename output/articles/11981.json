{"title":"Pentakis dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, a pentakis dodecahedron or kisdodecahedron is the polyhedron created by attaching a pentagonal pyramid to each face of a regular dodecahedron; that is, it is the Kleetope of the dodecahedron. It is a Catalan solid, meaning that it is a dual of an Archimedean solid, in this case, the truncated icosahedron.","image":"Pentakisdodecahedron.jpg.webp","url":"Pentakis_dodecahedron"}
