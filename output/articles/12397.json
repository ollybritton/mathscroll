{"title":"Positive-real function","summary":"Positive-real functions, often abbreviated to PR function or PRF, are a kind of mathematical function that first arose in electrical network synthesis. They are complex functions, Z(s), of a complex variable, s.  A rational function is defined to have the PR property if it has a positive real part and is analytic in the right half of the complex plane and takes on real values on the real axis.","image":"d7b679e1065be0df6748686d6b75484b4a6b3e6d.svg","url":"Positive-real_function"}
