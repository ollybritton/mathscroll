{"title":"Moessner's theorem","summary":"In number theory, Moessner's theorem or Moessner's magic[1] is related to an arithmetical algorithm to produce an infinite sequence of the exponents of positive integers 1 n , 2 n , 3 n , 4 n , ⋯ , {\\displaystyle 1^{n},2^{n},3^{n},4^{n},\\cdots ~,} with n ≥ 1 , {\\displaystyle n\\geq 1~,} by recursively manipulating the sequence of integers algebraically. The algorithm was first published by Alfred Moessner[2] in 1951; the first proof of its validity was given by Oskar Perron[3] that same year.[4]","image":"aa48ea0516ddaa65ca31057391214ebd1fb6043d.svg","url":"Moessner's_theorem"}
