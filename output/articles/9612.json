{"title":"Local parameter","summary":"In the geometry of complex algebraic curves, a local parameter for a curve C at a smooth point P is a meromorphic function on C that has a simple zero at P. This concept can be generalized to curves defined over fields other than C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } (or schemes), because the local ring at a smooth point P of an algebraic curve C (defined over an algebraically closed field) is always a discrete valuation ring.[1] This valuation will show a way to count the order (at the point P) of rational functions (which are natural generalizations for meromorphic functions in the non-complex realm) having a zero or a pole at P.","image":"f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7.svg","url":"Local_parameter"}
