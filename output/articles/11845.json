{"title":"Partially ordered group","summary":"In abstract algebra, a partially ordered group is a group (G, +) equipped with a partial order \"≤\" that is translation-invariant; in other words, \"≤\" has the property that, for all a, b, and g in G, if a ≤ b then a + g ≤ b + g and g + a ≤ g + b.","image":"3c1cf6a513f2062531d95dbb198944936f312982.svg","url":"Partially_ordered_group"}
