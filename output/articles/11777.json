{"title":"Paradoxical set","summary":"In set theory, a paradoxical set is a set that has a paradoxical decomposition. A paradoxical decomposition of a set is two families of disjoint subsets, along with appropriate group actions that act on some universe (of which the set in question is a subset), such that each partition can be mapped back onto the entire set using only finitely many distinct functions (or compositions thereof) to accomplish the mapping. A set that admits such a paradoxical decomposition where the actions belong to a group G {\\displaystyle G} is called G {\\displaystyle G} -paradoxical or paradoxical with respect to G {\\displaystyle G} .","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Paradoxical_set"}
