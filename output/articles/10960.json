{"title":"Natural transformation","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a natural transformation provides a way of transforming one functor into another while respecting the internal structure (i.e., the composition of morphisms) of the categories involved. Hence, a natural transformation can be considered to be a \"morphism of functors\". Informally, the notion of a natural transformation states that a particular map between functors can be done consistently over an entire category.","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"Natural_transformation"}
