{"title":"Energetic space","summary":"In mathematics, more precisely in functional analysis, an energetic space is, intuitively, a subspace of a given real Hilbert space equipped with a new \"energetic\" inner product. The motivation for the name comes from physics, as in many physical problems the energy of a system can be expressed in terms of the energetic inner product. An example of this will be given later in the article.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Energetic_space"}
