{"title":"Surjective function","summary":"In mathematics, a surjective function (also known as surjection, or onto function /ˈɒn.tuː/) is a function f such that every element y can be mapped from element x so that f(x) = y. In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the image of at least one element of its domain.[1][2] It is not required that x be unique; the function f may map one or more elements of X to the same element of Y.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Surjective_function"}
