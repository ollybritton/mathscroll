{"title":"Extractor (mathematics)","summary":"An ( N , M , D , K , ϵ ) {\\displaystyle (N,M,D,K,\\epsilon )} -extractor is a bipartite graph with N {\\displaystyle N} nodes on the left and M {\\displaystyle M} nodes on the right such that each node on the left has D {\\displaystyle D} neighbors (on the right), which has the added property that for any subset A {\\displaystyle A} of the left vertices of size at least K {\\displaystyle K} , the distribution on right vertices obtained by choosing a random node in A {\\displaystyle A} and then following a random edge to get a node x on the right side is ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } -close to the uniform distribution in terms of total variation distance.","image":"0ba96b578991933484440dd21dd0a0d0832ccb97.svg","url":"Extractor_(mathematics)"}
