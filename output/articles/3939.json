{"title":"Deltoidal icositetrahedron","summary":"In geometry, the deltoidal icositetrahedron (or trapezoidal icositetrahedron, tetragonal icosikaitetrahedron,[1] tetragonal trisoctahedron,[2] strombic icositetrahedron) is a Catalan solid. Its 24 faces are congruent kites.[3] The deltoidal icositetrahedron, whose dual is the (uniform) rhombicuboctahedron, is tightly related to the pseudo-deltoidal icositetrahedron, whose dual is the pseudorhombicuboctahedron; but the actual and pseudo-d.i. are not to be confused with each other.","image":"Deltoidalicositetrahedron.jpg.webp","url":"Deltoidal_icositetrahedron"}
