{"title":"Base (topology)","summary":"In mathematics, a base (or basis) for the topology τ of a topological space (X, τ) is a family B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}} of open subsets of X such that every open set of the topology is equal to the union of some sub-family of B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}} .  For example, the set of all open intervals in the real number line R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } is a basis for the Euclidean topology on R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } because every open interval is an open set, and also every open subset of R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } can be written as a union of some family of open intervals.","image":"e5622de88a69f68340f8dcb43d0b8bd443ba9e13.svg","url":"Base_(topology)"}
