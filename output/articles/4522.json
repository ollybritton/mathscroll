{"title":"Dummy variable (statistics)","summary":"In regression analysis, a dummy variable (also known as indicator variable or just dummy) is one that takes the values 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of some categorical effect that may be expected to shift the outcome.[1] For example, if we were studying the relationship between biological sex and income, we could use a dummy variable to represent the sex of each individual in the study. The variable would take on a value of 1 for males and 0 for females. In machine learning this is known as one-hot encoding.","image":"Wikiversity_logo_2017.svg.png.webp","url":"Dummy_variable_(statistics)"}
