{"title":"Modes of convergence (annotated index)","summary":"The purpose of this article is to serve as an annotated index of various modes of convergence and their logical relationships.  For an expository article, see Modes of convergence.  Simple logical relationships between different modes of convergence are indicated (e.g., if one implies another), formulaically rather than in prose for quick reference, and indepth descriptions and discussions are reserved for their respective articles.","image":"469b737d167b9b28a74e27c7f5e35b5ea9256100.svg","url":"Modes_of_convergence_(annotated_index)"}
