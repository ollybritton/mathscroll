{"title":"COST Hata model","summary":"The COST Hata model is a radio propagation model (i.e. path loss) that extends the urban Hata model (which in turn is based on the Okumura model) to cover a more elaborated range of frequencies (up to 2 GHz). It is the most often cited of the COST 231 models (EU funded research project ca. April 1986 â€“ April 1996),[1] also called the Hata Model PCS Extension. This model is the combination of empirical and deterministic models for estimating path loss in an urban area over frequency range of 800 MHz to 2000 MHz.[2]","image":"8fe4868bd0c567a77db1fc54acb880ff83b2bf81.svg","url":"COST_Hata_model"}
