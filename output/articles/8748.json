{"title":"Klein quartic","summary":"In hyperbolic geometry, the Klein quartic, named after Felix Klein, is a compact Riemann surface of genus 3 with the highest possible order automorphism group for this genus, namely order 168 orientation-preserving automorphisms, and 168 Ã— 2 = 336 automorphisms if orientation may be reversed.  As such, the Klein quartic is the Hurwitz surface of lowest possible genus; see Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem.  Its (orientation-preserving) automorphism group is isomorphic to PSL(2, 7), the second-smallest non-abelian simple group after the alternating group A5. The quartic was first described in (Klein 1878b).","image":"Order-7_triangular_tiling.svg.png.webp","url":"Klein_quartic"}
