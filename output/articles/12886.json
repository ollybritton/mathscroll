{"title":"Quarter hypercubic honeycomb","summary":"In geometry, the quarter hypercubic honeycomb (or quarter n-cubic honeycomb) is a dimensional infinite series of honeycombs, based on the hypercube honeycomb. It is given a Schläfli symbol q{4,3...3,4} or Coxeter symbol qδ4 representing the regular form with three quarters of the vertices removed and containing the symmetry of Coxeter group D ~ n − 1 {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {D}}_{n-1}} for n ≥ 5, with D ~ 4 {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {D}}_{4}} = A ~ 4 {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {A}}_{4}} and for quarter n-cubic honeycombs D ~ 5 {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {D}}_{5}} = B ~ 5 {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {B}}_{5}} .[1]","image":"69e6d0df87a0474161ba0ff72a5fc0e2e15bf395.svg","url":"Quarter_hypercubic_honeycomb"}
