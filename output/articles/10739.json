{"title":"Motivic cohomology","summary":"Motivic cohomology is an invariant of algebraic varieties and of more general schemes. It is a type of cohomology related to motives and includes the Chow ring of algebraic cycles as a special case. Some of the deepest problems in algebraic geometry and number theory are attempts to understand motivic cohomology.","image":"d7579f4f040bfe2cb81eb89b67d0797c8bb1d81b.svg","url":"Motivic_cohomology"}
