{"title":"Lefschetz fixed-point theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem is a formula that counts the fixed points of a continuous mapping from a compact topological space X {\\displaystyle X} to itself  by means of traces of the induced mappings on the homology groups of X {\\displaystyle X} . It is named after Solomon Lefschetz, who first stated it in 1926.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Lefschetz_fixed-point_theorem"}
