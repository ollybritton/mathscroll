{"title":"Stable count distribution","summary":"In probability theory, the stable count distribution is the conjugate prior of a one-sided stable distribution. This distribution was discovered by Stephen Lihn (Chinese: 藺鴻圖) in his 2017 study of daily distributions of the S&P 500 and the VIX.[1] The stable distribution family is also sometimes referred to as the Lévy alpha-stable distribution, after Paul Lévy, the first mathematician to have studied it.[2]","image":"The_PDF_of_stable_count_distribution.png.webp","url":"Stable_count_distribution"}
