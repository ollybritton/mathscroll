{"title":"Sullivan conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, Sullivan conjecture or Sullivan's conjecture on maps from classifying spaces can refer to any of several results and conjectures prompted by homotopy theory work of Dennis Sullivan. A basic theme and motivation concerns the fixed point set in group actions of a finite group G {\\displaystyle G} . The most elementary formulation, however, is in terms of the classifying space B G {\\displaystyle BG} of such a group. Roughly speaking, it is difficult to map such a space B G {\\displaystyle BG} continuously into a finite CW complex X {\\displaystyle X} in a non-trivial manner. Such a version of the Sullivan conjecture was first proved by Haynes Miller.[1] Specifically, in 1984, Miller proved that the function space, carrying the compact-open topology, of base point-preserving mappings from B G {\\displaystyle BG} to X {\\displaystyle X} is weakly contractible.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Sullivan_conjecture"}
