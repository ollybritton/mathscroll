{"title":"Two-dimensional singular-value decomposition","summary":"Two-dimensional singular-value decomposition (2DSVD) computes the low-rank approximation of a set of matrices such as 2D images or weather maps in a manner almost identical to SVD (singular-value decomposition) which computes the low-rank approximation of a single matrix (or a set of 1D vectors).","image":"e44d067caca6bc1bbc0be71cce550a956d24ab9e.svg","url":"Two-dimensional_singular-value_decomposition"}
