{"title":"Toponogov's theorem","summary":"In the mathematical field of Riemannian geometry, Toponogov's theorem (named after Victor Andreevich Toponogov) is a triangle comparison theorem. It is one of a family of comparison theorems that quantify the assertion that a pair of geodesics emanating from a point p spread apart more slowly in a region of high curvature than they would in a region of low curvature.","image":"0abcc5eee14812ef4e06210c00de93f8e6eda606.svg","url":"Toponogov's_theorem"}
