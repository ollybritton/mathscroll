{"title":"Quasiconvexity (calculus of variations)","summary":"In the calculus of variations, a subfield of mathematics, quasiconvexity is a generalisation of the notion of convexity. It is used to characterise the integrand of a functional and related to the existence of minimisers. Under some natural conditions, quasiconvexity of the integrand is a necessary and sufficient condition for a functional","image":"943c27d6760b6111c72c0914f9bd75d71c95fc63.svg","url":"Quasiconvexity_(calculus_of_variations)"}
