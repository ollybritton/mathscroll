{"title":"Euclidean minimum spanning tree","summary":"A Euclidean minimum spanning tree of a finite set of points in the Euclidean plane or higher-dimensional Euclidean space connects the points by a system of line segments with the points as endpoints, minimizing the total length of the segments. In it, any two points can reach each other along a path through the line segments. It can be found as the minimum spanning tree of a complete graph with the points as vertices and the Euclidean distances between points as edge weights.","image":"Euclidean_minimum_spanning_tree.svg.png.webp","url":"Euclidean_minimum_spanning_tree"}
