{"title":"Elongated triangular gyrobicupola","summary":"In geometry, the elongated triangular gyrobicupola is one of the Johnson solids  (J36). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a \"triangular gyrobicupola,\" or cuboctahedron, by inserting a hexagonal prism between its two halves, which are congruent triangular cupolae (J3). Rotating one of the cupolae through 60 degrees before the elongation yields the triangular orthobicupola (J35).","image":"Elongated_triangular_gyrobicupola.png.webp","url":"Elongated_triangular_gyrobicupola"}
