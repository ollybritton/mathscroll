{"title":"Incidence algebra","summary":"In order theory, a field of mathematics, an incidence algebra is an associative algebra, defined for every locally finite partially ordered set and commutative ring with unity. Subalgebras called reduced incidence algebras give a natural construction of various types of generating functions used in combinatorics and number theory.","image":"c3343cea1efade7fc40ea8be29ba425c2c3dfb05.svg","url":"Incidence_algebra"}
