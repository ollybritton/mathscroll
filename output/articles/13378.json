{"title":"Renewal theory","summary":"Renewal theory is the branch of probability theory that generalizes the Poisson process for arbitrary holding times. Instead of exponentially distributed holding times, a renewal process may have any independent and identically distributed (IID) holding times that have finite mean. A renewal-reward process additionally has a random sequence of rewards incurred at each holding time, which are IID but need not be independent of the holding times.","image":"ea26578dd72bf4dbc3fa391c9feb11eed495699b.svg","url":"Renewal_theory"}
