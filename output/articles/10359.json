{"title":"Method of exhaustion","summary":"The method of exhaustion (Latin: methodus exhaustionibus) is a method of finding the area of a shape by inscribing inside it a sequence of polygons whose areas converge to the area of the containing shape. If the sequence is correctly constructed, the difference in area between the nth polygon and the containing shape will become arbitrarily small as n becomes large. As this difference becomes arbitrarily small, the possible values for the area of the shape are systematically \"exhausted\" by the lower bound areas successively established by the sequence members.","image":"Gr√©goire_de_Saint-Vincent_(1584-1667).jpg.webp","url":"Method_of_exhaustion"}
