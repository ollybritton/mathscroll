{"title":"Ethnomathematics","summary":"In mathematics education, ethnomathematics is the study of the relationship between mathematics and culture.[1] Often associated with \"cultures without written expression\",[2] it may also be defined as \"the mathematics which is practised among identifiable cultural groups\".[3] It refers to a broad cluster of ideas ranging from distinct numerical and mathematical systems to multicultural mathematics education. The goal of ethnomathematics is to contribute both to the understanding of culture and the understanding of mathematics, and mainly to lead to an appreciation of the connections between the two.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Ethnomathematics"}
