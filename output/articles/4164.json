{"title":"Dipole graph","summary":"In graph theory, a dipole graph, dipole, bond graph, or linkage, is a multigraph consisting of two vertices connected with a number of parallel edges. A dipole graph containing n edges is called the order-n dipole graph, and is denoted by Dn. The order-n dipole graph is dual to the cycle graph Cn.","image":"Dipole_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Dipole_graph"}
