{"title":"Gaussian isoperimetric inequality","summary":"In mathematics, the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality, proved by Boris Tsirelson and Vladimir Sudakov,[1] and later independently by Christer Borell,[2] states that among all sets of given Gaussian measure in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, half-spaces have the minimal Gaussian boundary measure.","image":"b0c483983109807a80190e8209374836d7064068.svg","url":"Gaussian_isoperimetric_inequality"}
