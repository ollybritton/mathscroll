{"title":"Singularity function","summary":"Singularity functions are a class of discontinuous functions that contain singularities, i.e. they are discontinuous at their singular points. Singularity functions have been heavily studied in the field of mathematics under the alternative names of generalized functions and distribution theory.[1][2][3] The functions are notated with brackets, as ⟨ x − a ⟩ n {\\displaystyle \\langle x-a\\rangle ^{n}} where n is an integer. The \" ⟨ ⟩ {\\displaystyle \\langle \\rangle } \" are often referred to as singularity brackets . The functions are defined as:","image":"38a9ed6f3171e5930be423a72cbf7f2b56b3367d.svg","url":"Singularity_function"}
