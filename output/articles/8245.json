{"title":"Jean-Loup Waldspurger","summary":"Jean-Loup Waldspurger (born July 2, 1953) is a French mathematician working on the Langlands program and related areas. He proved Waldspurger's theorem, the Waldspurger formula, and the local Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for orthogonal groups. He played a role in the proof of the fundamental lemma, reducing the conjecture to a version for Lie algebras. This formulation was ultimately proven by Ngô Bảo Châu.","image":"82eded4798b6d4c9267e1e679cc801fc0578d028.svg","url":"Jean-Loup_Waldspurger"}
