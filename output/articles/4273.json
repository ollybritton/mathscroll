{"title":"Disdyakis dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, a disdyakis dodecahedron, (also hexoctahedron,[1] hexakis octahedron, octakis cube, octakis hexahedron, kisrhombic dodecahedron[2]), is a Catalan solid with 48 faces and the dual to the Archimedean truncated cuboctahedron. As such it is face-transitive but with irregular face polygons. It resembles an augmented rhombic dodecahedron. Replacing each face of the rhombic dodecahedron with a flat pyramid creates a polyhedron that looks almost like the disdyakis dodecahedron, and is topologically equivalent to it.","image":"Disdyakisdodecahedron.jpg.webp","url":"Disdyakis_dodecahedron"}
