{"title":"Cyclotruncated 7-simplex honeycomb","summary":"In seven-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the cyclotruncated 7-simplex honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). The tessellation fills space by 7-simplex, truncated 7-simplex, bitruncated 7-simplex, and tritruncated 7-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 1:1:1:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.","image":"CDel_branch_11.png.webp","url":"Cyclotruncated_7-simplex_honeycomb"}
