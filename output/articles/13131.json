{"title":"Rastrigin function","summary":"In mathematical optimization, the Rastrigin function is a non-convex function used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. It is a typical example of non-linear multimodal function. It was first proposed in 1974 by Rastrigin[1] as a 2-dimensional function and has been generalized by Rudolph.[2] The generalized version was popularized by Hoffmeister & Bäck[3] and Mühlenbein et al.[4] Finding the minimum of this function is a fairly difficult problem due to its large search space and its large number of local minima.","image":"Rastrigin_function.png.webp","url":"Rastrigin_function"}
