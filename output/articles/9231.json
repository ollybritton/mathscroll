{"title":"Level structure (algebraic geometry)","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a level structure on a space X is an extra structure attached to X that shrinks or eliminates the automorphism group of X, by demanding automorphisms to preserve the level structure; attaching a level structure is often phrased as rigidifying the geometry of X.[1][2]","image":"d58432b395d1fe92ac4ef5b70eb9a747aca749c7.svg","url":"Level_structure_(algebraic_geometry)"}
