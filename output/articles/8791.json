{"title":"Kolmogorov automorphism","summary":"In mathematics, a Kolmogorov automorphism, K-automorphism, K-shift or K-system is an invertible, measure-preserving automorphism defined on a standard probability space that obeys Kolmogorov's zeroâ€“one law.[1]  All Bernoulli automorphisms are K-automorphisms (one says they have the K-property), but not vice versa.  Many ergodic dynamical systems have been shown to have the K-property, although more recent research has shown that many of these are in fact Bernoulli automorphisms.","image":"b0b82ce83307f027b4067673af86941a4fada4d7.svg","url":"Kolmogorov_automorphism"}
