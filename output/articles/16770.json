{"title":"Weak operator topology","summary":"In functional analysis, the weak operator topology, often abbreviated WOT, is the weakest topology on the set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space H {\\displaystyle H} , such that the functional sending an operator T {\\displaystyle T} to the complex number ⟨ T x , y ⟩ {\\displaystyle \\langle Tx,y\\rangle } is continuous for any vectors x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} in the Hilbert space.","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Weak_operator_topology"}
