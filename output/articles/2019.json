{"title":"Bruhat decomposition","summary":"In mathematics, the Bruhat decomposition (introduced by  François Bruhat for classical groups and by Claude Chevalley in general) G = BWB of certain algebraic groups G into cells can be regarded as a general expression of the principle of Gauss–Jordan elimination, which generically writes a matrix as a product of an upper triangular and lower triangular matrices—but with exceptional cases. It is related to the Schubert cell decomposition of flag varieties: see Weyl group for this.","image":"b01fc00e48748404a994af7c074e89e964efd21b.svg","url":"Bruhat_decomposition"}
