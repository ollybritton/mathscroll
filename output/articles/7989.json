{"title":"Inverse curve","summary":"In inversive geometry, an inverse curve of a given curve C is the result of applying an inverse operation to C. Specifically, with respect to a fixed circle with center O and radius k the inverse of a point Q is the point P for which P lies on the ray OQ and OPÂ·OQ = k2. The inverse of the curve C is then the locus of P as Q runs over C. The point O in this construction is called the center of inversion, the circle the circle of inversion, and k the radius of inversion.","image":"Inverse_Curves_Parabola_Cardioid.svg.png.webp","url":"Inverse_curve"}
