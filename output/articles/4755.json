{"title":"Elliptic gamma function","summary":"In mathematics, the elliptic gamma function is a generalization of the q-gamma function, which is itself the q-analog of the ordinary gamma function. It is closely related to a function studied by Jackson (1905), and can be expressed in terms of the triple gamma function. It is given by","image":"37683b1cb7572224134ebb657e1446f0c91fd006.svg","url":"Elliptic_gamma_function"}
