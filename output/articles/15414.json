{"title":"Syntactic predicate","summary":"A syntactic predicate specifies the syntactic validity of applying a production in a formal grammar and is analogous to a semantic predicate that specifies the semantic validity of applying a production.  It is a simple and effective means of dramatically improving the recognition strength of an LL parser by providing arbitrary lookahead.  In their original implementation, syntactic predicates had the form “( α )?” and could only appear on the left edge of a production. The required syntactic condition α could be any valid context-free grammar fragment.","image":"3661e8dc1c57decbb448914651cd6ce334fd4441.svg","url":"Syntactic_predicate"}
