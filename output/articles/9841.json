{"title":"Mackey–Glass equations","summary":"In mathematics and mathematical biology, the Mackey–Glass equations, named after Michael Mackey and Leon Glass, refer to a family of delay differential equations whose behaviour manages to mimic both healthy and pathological behaviour in certain biological contexts, controlled by the equation's parameters.[1] Originally, they were used to model the variation in the relative quantity of mature cells in the blood.
