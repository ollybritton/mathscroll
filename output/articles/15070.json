{"title":"Stirling number","summary":"In mathematics, Stirling numbers arise in a variety of analytic and combinatorial problems. They are named after James Stirling, who introduced them in a purely algebraic setting in his book Methodus differentialis (1730).[1] They were rediscovered and given a combinatorial meaning by Masanobu Saka in 1782.[2]","image":"a4e05fa2e535d3ba251305da934078f5817ed293.svg","url":"Stirling_number"}
