{"title":"Convection–diffusion equation","summary":"The convection–diffusion equation is a combination of the diffusion and convection (advection) equations, and describes physical phenomena where particles, energy, or other physical quantities are transferred inside a physical system due to two processes: diffusion and convection. Depending on context, the same equation can be called the advection–diffusion equation, drift–diffusion equation,[1] or (generic) scalar transport equation.[2]","image":"ba414a82e84548322874d8d9584a2663bb1de612.svg","url":"Convection–diffusion_equation"}
