{"title":"Bendixson's inequality","summary":"In mathematics, Bendixson's inequality is a quantitative result in the field of matrices derived by Ivar Bendixson in 1902.[1][2] The inequality puts limits on the imaginary and real parts of characteristic roots (eigenvalues) of real matrices.[3] A special case of this inequality leads to the result that characteristic roots of a real symmetric matrix are always real.","image":"d49c961eb0b65512280eb4e3e5c960d6d666b521.svg","url":"Bendixson's_inequality"}
