{"title":"Domain theory","summary":"Domain theory is a branch of mathematics that studies special kinds of partially ordered sets (posets) commonly called domains. Consequently, domain theory can be considered as a branch of order theory. The field has major applications in computer science, where it is used to specify denotational semantics, especially for functional programming languages. Domain theory formalizes the intuitive ideas of approximation and convergence in a very general way and is closely related to topology.","image":"77a179fe8eecc2594cfbb26ad95a8bb08eebd73b.svg","url":"Domain_theory"}
