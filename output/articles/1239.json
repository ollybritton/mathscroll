{"title":"BPL (complexity)","summary":"In computational complexity theory, BPL (Bounded-error Probabilistic Logarithmic-space),[1] sometimes called BPLP (Bounded-error Probabilistic Logarithmic-space Polynomial-time),[2] is the complexity class of problems solvable in logarithmic space and polynomial time with probabilistic Turing machines with two-sided error. It is named in analogy with BPP, which is similar but has no logarithmic space restriction.","image":"02d82ca27d50bd2751e43adcc5ce9507b46bb27f.svg","url":"BPL_(complexity)"}
