{"title":"Coordinate-induced basis","summary":"In mathematics, a coordinate-induced basis is a basis for the tangent space or cotangent space of a manifold that is induced by a certain coordinate system. Given the coordinate system x a {\\displaystyle x^{a}} , the coordinate-induced basis e a {\\displaystyle e_{a}} of the tangent space is given by","image":"39e0aeaa9f539d95a769634b9e33974b45675111.svg","url":"Coordinate-induced_basis"}
