{"title":"Countably quasi-barrelled space","summary":"In functional analysis, a topological vector space (TVS) is said to be countably quasi-barrelled if every strongly bounded countable union of equicontinuous subsets of its continuous dual space is again equicontinuous. This property is a generalization of quasibarrelled spaces.","image":"d7a3a5819cc45f097de14b3ac5a8bedd902bc66d.svg","url":"Countably_quasi-barrelled_space"}
