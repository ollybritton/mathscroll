{"title":"Lax–Friedrichs method","summary":"The Lax–Friedrichs method, named after Peter Lax and Kurt O. Friedrichs, is a numerical method for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations based on finite differences.  The method can be described as the FTCS (forward in time, centered in space) scheme with a numerical dissipation term of 1/2.  One can view the Lax–Friedrichs method as an alternative to Godunov's scheme, where one avoids solving a Riemann problem at each cell interface, at the expense of adding artificial viscosity.","image":"84e6a2bc1b46671c8ec2bd22f48f53e4aa6b9597.svg","url":"Lax–Friedrichs_method"}
