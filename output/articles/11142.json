{"title":"Non-autonomous mechanics","summary":"Non-autonomous mechanics describe non-relativistic mechanical systems subject to time-dependent transformations. In particular, this is the case of mechanical systems whose Lagrangians and Hamiltonians depend on the time. The configuration space of non-autonomous mechanics is a fiber bundle Q â†’ R {\\displaystyle Q\\to \\mathbb {R} } over the time axis R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } coordinated by ( t , q i ) {\\displaystyle (t,q^{i})} .","image":"a46144cc91a453df7fadc4e92a8cd9d40f5b02e0.svg","url":"Non-autonomous_mechanics"}
