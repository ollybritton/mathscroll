{"title":"LB-space","summary":"In mathematics, an LB-space, also written (LB)-space, is a topological vector space X {\\displaystyle X} that is a locally convex inductive limit of a countable inductive system ( X n , i n m ) {\\displaystyle (X_{n},i_{nm})} of Banach spaces. This means that X {\\displaystyle X} is a direct limit of a direct system ( X n , i n m ) {\\displaystyle \\left(X_{n},i_{nm}\\right)} in the category of locally convex topological vector spaces and each X n {\\displaystyle X_{n}} is a Banach space.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"LB-space"}
