{"title":"Prevalent and shy sets","summary":"In mathematics, the notions of prevalence and shyness are notions of \"almost everywhere\" and \"measure zero\" that are well-suited to the study of infinite-dimensional spaces and make use of the translation-invariant Lebesgue measure on finite-dimensional real spaces. The term \"shy\" was suggested by the American mathematician John Milnor.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Prevalent_and_shy_sets"}
