{"title":"Sidon sequence","summary":"In number theory, a Sidon sequence is a sequence A = { a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , … } {\\displaystyle A=\\{a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\\dots \\}} of natural numbers in which all pairwise sums a i + a j {\\displaystyle a_{i}+a_{j}} (for i ≤ j {\\displaystyle i\\leq j} ) are different. Sidon sequences are also called Sidon sets; they are named after the Hungarian mathematician Simon Sidon, who introduced the concept in his investigations of Fourier series.","image":"aa01884e9cb6ddaf86f16cc8aeb7593fc1670f09.svg","url":"Sidon_sequence"}
