{"title":"Complex coordinate space","summary":"In mathematics, the n-dimensional complex coordinate space (or complex n-space) is the set of all ordered n-tuples of complex numbers.  It is denoted C n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{n}} , and is the n-fold Cartesian product of the complex plane C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } with itself.
