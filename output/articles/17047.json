{"title":"Xor–encrypt–xor","summary":"The xor–encrypt–xor (XEX) is a (tweakable) mode of operation of a block cipher. In tweaked-codebook mode with ciphertext stealing (XTS mode), it is one of the more popular modes of operation for whole-disk encryption. XEX is also a common form of key whitening, and part of some smart card proposals.[1][2]","image":"Xor_Encrypt_Xor.svg.png.webp","url":"Xor–encrypt–xor"}
