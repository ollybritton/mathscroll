{"title":"Descartes' theorem","summary":"In geometry, Descartes' theorem states that for every four kissing, or mutually tangent, circles, the radii of the circles satisfy a certain quadratic equation. By solving this equation, one can construct a fourth circle tangent to three given, mutually tangent circles. The theorem is named after Ren√© Descartes, who stated it in 1643.","image":"Descartes_Circles.svg.png.webp","url":"Descartes'_theorem"}
