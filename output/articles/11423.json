{"title":"Open mapping theorem (complex analysis)","summary":"In complex analysis, the open mapping theorem states that if U is a domain of the complex plane C and f : U → C is a non-constant holomorphic function, then f is an open map (i.e. it sends open subsets of U to open subsets of C, and we have invariance of domain.).","image":"Openmappingtheorem.png.webp","url":"Open_mapping_theorem_(complex_analysis)"}
