{"title":"Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity","summary":"In algebra, the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity[1][2] expresses the product of two sums of two squares as a sum of two squares in two different ways. Hence the set of all sums of two squares is closed under multiplication. Specifically, the identity says","image":"7ab35734d306c0d9f5c78d5604dd76a2c52eb694.svg","url":"Brahmagupta–Fibonacci_identity"}
