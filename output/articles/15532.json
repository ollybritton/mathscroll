{"title":"Taubes's Gromov invariant","summary":"In mathematics, the Gromov invariant of Clifford Taubes counts embedded (possibly disconnected) pseudoholomorphic curves in a symplectic 4-manifold, where the curves are holomorphic with respect to an auxiliary compatible almost complex structure.  (Multiple covers of 2-tori with self-intersection 0 are also counted.)","image":"b119fb96fa7ad331b16e6586b4867020206bc489.svg","url":"Taubes's_Gromov_invariant"}
