{"title":"Smooth projective plane","summary":"In geometry, smooth projective planes are special projective planes. The most prominent example of a smooth projective plane is the real projective plane E {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {E}}} . Its geometric operations of joining two distinct points by a line and of intersecting two lines in a point are not only continuous but even smooth (infinitely differentiable = C âˆž {\\displaystyle =C^{\\infty }} ). Similarly, the classical planes over the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions are smooth planes. However, these are not the only such planes.","image":"9c298ed828ff778065aeb5f0f305097f55bb9ae0.svg","url":"Smooth_projective_plane"}
