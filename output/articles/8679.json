{"title":"Kervaire invariant","summary":"In mathematics, the Kervaire invariant is an invariant of a framed ( 4 k + 2 ) {\\displaystyle (4k+2)} -dimensional manifold that measures whether the manifold could be surgically converted into a sphere. This invariant evaluates to 0 if the manifold can be converted to a sphere, and 1 otherwise. This invariant was named after Michel Kervaire who built on work of Cahit Arf.","image":"6b86b5f9d309cee02def8c847d9623138e238513.svg","url":"Kervaire_invariant"}
