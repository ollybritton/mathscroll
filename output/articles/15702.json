{"title":"Theta function","summary":"In mathematics, theta functions are special functions of several complex variables. They show up in many topics, including Abelian varieties, moduli spaces, quadratic forms, and solitons. As Grassmann algebras, they appear in quantum field theory.[1]","image":"Cplot_of_Jacobi_theta_1.svg.png.webp","url":"Theta_function"}
