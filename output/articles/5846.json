{"title":"Fundamental domain","summary":"Given a topological space and a group acting on it, the images of a single point under the group action form an orbit of the action. A fundamental domain or fundamental region is a subset of the space which contains exactly one point from each of these orbits. It serves as a geometric realization for the abstract set of representatives of the orbits.","image":"Lattice_torsion_points.svg.png.webp","url":"Fundamental_domain"}
