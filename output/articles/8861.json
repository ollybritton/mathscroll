{"title":"Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance","summary":"The Kruskal–Wallis test by ranks, Kruskal–Wallis H test[1] (named after William Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis), or one-way ANOVA on ranks[1] is a non-parametric method for testing whether samples originate from the same distribution.[2][3][4] It is used for comparing two or more independent samples of equal or different sample sizes. It extends the Mann–Whitney U test, which is used for comparing only two groups. The parametric equivalent of the Kruskal–Wallis test is the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).","image":"c52009c6c21918d5389c27dc7e9d853a2462119e.svg","url":"Kruskal–Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance"}
