{"title":"Mazur's lemma","summary":"In mathematics, Mazur's lemma is a result in the theory of normed vector spaces. It shows that any weakly convergent sequence in a normed space has a sequence of convex combinations of its members that converges strongly to the same limit, and is used in the proof of Tonelli's theorem.","image":"15d5aff0f4f2ef4433fbb34b70e6cc92187db708.svg","url":"Mazur's_lemma"}
