{"title":"Degree of a continuous mapping","summary":"In topology, the degree of a continuous mapping between two compact oriented manifolds of the same dimension is a number that represents the number of times that the domain manifold wraps around the range manifold under the mapping.  The degree is always an integer, but may be positive or negative depending on the orientations.","image":"Sphere_wrapped_round_itself.png.webp","url":"Degree_of_a_continuous_mapping"}
