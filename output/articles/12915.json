{"title":"Quasi-isometry","summary":"In mathematics, a quasi-isometry is a function between two metric spaces that respects large-scale geometry of these spaces and ignores their small-scale details. Two metric spaces are quasi-isometric if there exists a quasi-isometry between them. The property of being quasi-isometric behaves like an equivalence relation on the class of metric spaces.","image":"Equilateral_Triangle_Lattice.svg.png.webp","url":"Quasi-isometry"}
