{"title":"Real tree","summary":"In mathematics, real trees (also called R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } -trees) are a class of metric spaces generalising simplicial trees. They arise naturally in many mathematical contexts, in particular geometric group theory and probability theory. They are also the simplest examples of Gromov hyperbolic spaces.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Real_tree"}
