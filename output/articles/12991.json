{"title":"Quotient ring","summary":"In ring theory, a branch of abstract algebra, a quotient ring, also known as factor ring, difference ring[1] or residue class ring, is a construction quite similar to the quotient group in group theory and to the quotient space in linear algebra.[2][3] It is a specific example of a quotient, as viewed from the general setting of universal algebra. Starting with a ring R and a two-sided ideal I in R, a new ring, the quotient ring R / I, is constructed, whose elements are the cosets of I in R subject to special + and â‹… operations. (Only the fraction slash \"/\" is used in quotient ring notation, not a horizontal fraction bar.)","image":"Latex_integers.svg.png.webp","url":"Quotient_ring"}
