{"title":"Tractrix","summary":"In geometry, a tractrix (from Latin  trahereÂ 'to pull, drag'; plural: tractrices) is the curve along which an object moves, under the influence of friction, when pulled on a horizontal plane by a line segment attached to a pulling point (the tractor) that moves at a right angle to the initial line between the object and the puller at an infinitesimal speed. It is therefore a curve of pursuit. It was first introduced by Claude Perrault in 1670, and later studied by Isaac Newton (1676) and Christiaan Huygens (1693).[1]","image":"Tractrixtry.gif","url":"Tractrix"}
