{"title":"Virtually","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra that studies infinite groups, the adverb virtually is used to modify a property so that it need only hold for a subgroup of finite index.  Given a property P, the group G is said to be virtually P if there is a finite index subgroup H â‰¤ G {\\displaystyle H\\leq G} such that H has property P.","image":"c9c017471513c8b1345c68cf521c2a7c451bad4e.svg","url":"Virtually"}
