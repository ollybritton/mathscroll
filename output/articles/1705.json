{"title":"Birman–Wenzl algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the Birman–Murakami–Wenzl (BMW) algebra, introduced by Joan Birman and Hans Wenzl (1989) and Jun Murakami (1987), is a two-parameter family of algebras C n ( ℓ , m ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {C} _{n}(\\ell ,m)} of dimension 1 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 ⋯ ( 2 n − 1 ) {\\displaystyle 1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdots (2n-1)} having the Hecke algebra of the symmetric group as a quotient.  It is related to the Kauffman polynomial of a link. It is a deformation of  the Brauer algebra in much the same way that Hecke algebras are deformations of the group algebra of the symmetric group.","image":"5830f618420f27d672252e082c978314c5d78c8f.svg","url":"Birman–Wenzl_algebra"}
