{"title":"Sparse language","summary":"In computational complexity theory, a sparse language is a formal language (a set of strings) such that the complexity function, counting the number of strings of length n in the language, is bounded by a polynomial function of n. They are used primarily in the study of the relationship of the complexity class NP with other classes. The complexity class of all sparse languages is called SPARSE.","image":"963a810ba39e3e0725c523d0c98b18f39786ebb2.svg","url":"Sparse_language"}
