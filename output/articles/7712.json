{"title":"Independence-friendly logic","summary":"Independence-friendly logic (IF logic; proposed by Jaakko Hintikka and Gabriel Sandu in 1989)[1] is an extension of classical first-order logic (FOL) by means of slashed quantifiers of the form ( ∃ v / V ) {\\displaystyle (\\exists v/V)} and ( ∀ v / V ) {\\displaystyle (\\forall v/V)} , where V {\\displaystyle V} is a finite set of variables. The intended reading of ( ∃ v / V ) {\\displaystyle (\\exists v/V)} is \"there is a v {\\displaystyle v} which is functionally independent from the variables in V {\\displaystyle V} \". IF logic allows one to express more general patterns of dependence between variables than those which are implicit in first-order logic. This greater level of generality leads to an actual increase in expressive power; the set of IF sentences can characterize the same classes of structures as existential second-order logic ( Σ 1 1 {\\displaystyle \\Sigma _{1}^{1}} ).","image":"e95cb641df6da8cd4adc7582628888a7f360d9c0.svg","url":"Independence-friendly_logic"}
