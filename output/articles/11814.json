{"title":"Parity-check matrix","summary":"In coding theory, a parity-check matrix of a linear block code C is a matrix which describes the linear relations that the components of a codeword must satisfy. It can be used to decide whether a particular vector is a codeword and is also used in decoding algorithms.","image":"7febe26c143250bd1cac3154810002e203dc50df.svg","url":"Parity-check_matrix"}
