{"title":"Typical set","summary":"In information theory, the typical set is a set of sequences whose probability is close to two raised to the negative power of the entropy of their source distribution. That this set has total probability close to one is a consequence of the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) which is a kind of law of large numbers. The notion of typicality is only concerned with the probability of a sequence and not the actual sequence itself.","image":"8c7e5461c5286852df4ef652fca7e4b0b63030e9.svg","url":"Typical_set"}
