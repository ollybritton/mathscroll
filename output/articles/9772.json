{"title":"Lune (geometry)","summary":"In plane geometry, a lune (from Latin  lunaÂ 'moon') is the concave-convex region bounded by two circular arcs.[1] It has one boundary portion for which the connecting segment of any two nearby points moves outside the region and another boundary portion for which the connecting segment of any two nearby points lies entirely inside the region. A convex-convex region is termed a lens.[2]","image":"Luno_ebena_geom_1.png.webp","url":"Lune_(geometry)"}
