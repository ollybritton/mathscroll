{"title":"Constructive proof","summary":"In mathematics, a constructive proof is a method of proof that demonstrates the existence of a mathematical object by creating or providing a method for creating the object. This is in contrast to a non-constructive proof (also known as an existence proof or pure existence theorem), which proves the existence of a particular kind of object without providing an example. For avoiding confusion with the stronger concept that follows, such a constructive proof is sometimes called an effective proof.","image":"8808d7cace871e6ef01dbd8e1a95e3ad0ae77ad4.svg","url":"Constructive_proof"}
