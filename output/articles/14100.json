{"title":"Semi-Thue system","summary":"In theoretical computer science and mathematical logic a string rewriting system (SRS), historically called a semi-Thue system, is a rewriting system over strings from a (usually finite) alphabet. Given a binary relation R {\\displaystyle R} between fixed strings over the alphabet, called rewrite rules, denoted by s → t {\\displaystyle s\\rightarrow t} , an SRS extends the rewriting relation to all strings in which the left- and right-hand side of the rules appear as substrings, that is u s v → u t v {\\displaystyle usv\\rightarrow utv} , where s {\\displaystyle s} , t {\\displaystyle t} , u {\\displaystyle u} , and v {\\displaystyle v} are strings.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Semi-Thue_system"}
