{"title":"Partial linear space","summary":"A partial linear space (also semilinear or near-linear space) is a basic incidence structure in the field of incidence geometry, that carries slightly less structure than a linear space. The notion is equivalent to that of a linear hypergraph.","image":"2895c01a0d507b8cf31456583cce66a6257e55d2.svg","url":"Partial_linear_space"}
