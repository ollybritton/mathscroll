{"title":"Abelian 2-group","summary":"In mathematics, an Abelian 2-group is a higher dimensional analogue of an Abelian group, in the sense of higher algebra,[1] which were originally introduced by Alexander Grothendieck while studying abstract structures surrounding Abelian varieties and Picard groups.[2] More concretely, they are given by groupoids A {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {A} } which have a bifunctor + : A × A → A {\\displaystyle +:\\mathbb {A} \\times \\mathbb {A} \\to \\mathbb {A} } which acts formally like the addition an Abelian group. Namely, the bifunctor + {\\displaystyle +} has a notion of commutativity, associativity, and an identity structure. Although this seems like a rather lofty and abstract structure, there are several (very concrete) examples of Abelian 2-groups. In fact, some of which provide prototypes for more complex examples of higher algebraic structures, such as Abelian n-groups.","image":"3fb423c16a5f403edbaf66438b75e7a36e725af6.svg","url":"Abelian_2-group"}
