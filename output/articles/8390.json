{"title":"Johnson graph","summary":"Johnson graphs are a special class of undirected graphs defined from systems of sets. The vertices of the Johnson graph J ( n , k ) {\\displaystyle J(n,k)} are the k {\\displaystyle k} -element subsets of an n {\\displaystyle n} -element set; two vertices are adjacent when the intersection of the two vertices (subsets) contains ( k âˆ’ 1 ) {\\displaystyle (k-1)} -elements.[1] Both Johnson graphs and the closely related Johnson scheme are named after Selmer M. Johnson.","image":"83e07aed9cf92736e46a83d88488c130b93ee2a6.svg","url":"Johnson_graph"}
