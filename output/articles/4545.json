{"title":"Dynamic amplification factor","summary":"Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF) or Dynamic Increase Factor (DIF), is a dimensionless number which describes how many times the deflections or stresses should be multiplied to the deflections or stresses caused by the static loads when a dynamic load is applied on to a structure.[1]","image":"2b4459aeaecaabb17f51c697e419e35082d9470c.svg","url":"Dynamic_amplification_factor"}
