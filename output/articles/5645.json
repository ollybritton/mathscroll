{"title":"Fractional model","summary":"In applied statistics, fractional models are, to some extent, related to binary response models. However, instead of estimating the probability of being in one bin of a dichotomous variable, the fractional model typically deals with variables that take on all possible values in the unit interval. One can easily generalize this model to take on values on any other interval by appropriate transformations.[1] Examples range from participation rates in 401(k) plans[2] to television ratings of NBA games.[3]","image":"3d6c54a4802e9900e61f114e0912c2bc7c1092da.svg","url":"Fractional_model"}
