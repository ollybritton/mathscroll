{"title":"Probabilistic method","summary":"In mathematics, the probabilistic method is a nonconstructive method, primarily used in combinatorics and pioneered by Paul Erd≈ës, for proving the existence of a prescribed kind of mathematical object. It works by showing that if one randomly chooses objects from a specified class, the probability that the result is of the prescribed kind is strictly greater than zero. Although the proof uses probability, the final conclusion is determined for certain, without any possible error.","image":"584f349f7b6bf04464096bd439ab9f95695bae59.svg","url":"Probabilistic_method"}
