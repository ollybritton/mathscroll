{"title":"Multipartite graph","summary":"In graph theory, a part of mathematics, a k-partite graph is a graph whose vertices are (or can be) partitioned into k different independent sets. Equivalently, it is a graph that can be colored with k colors, so that no two endpoints of an edge have the same color. When k = 2 these are the bipartite graphs, and when k = 3 they are called the tripartite graphs.","image":"Complex_tripartite_graph_octahedron.svg.png.webp","url":"Multipartite_graph"}
