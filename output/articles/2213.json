{"title":"Carathéodory's existence theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Carathéodory's existence theorem says that an ordinary differential equation has a solution under relatively mild conditions. It is a generalization of Peano's existence theorem. Peano's theorem requires that the right-hand side of the differential equation be continuous, while Carathéodory's theorem shows existence of solutions (in a more general sense) for some discontinuous equations. The theorem is named after Constantin Carathéodory.","image":"d4cd2c88e9d832c0b7f6c3896ff022142d2239aa.svg","url":"Carathéodory's_existence_theorem"}
