{"title":"Hilbert modular variety","summary":"In mathematics, a Hilbert modular surface or Hilbertâ€“Blumenthal surface is an algebraic surface obtained by taking a quotient of a product of two copies of the upper half-plane by a Hilbert modular group. More generally, a Hilbert modular variety is an algebraic variety obtained by taking a quotient of a product of multiple copies of the upper half-plane by a Hilbert modular group.","image":"22a282d6f92978e2ce57ba18127a6dcb2e0a7bbb.svg","url":"Hilbert_modular_variety"}
