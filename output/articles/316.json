{"title":"Academic Games","summary":"Academic Games is a competition in the U.S. in which players win by out-thinking each other in mathematics, language arts, and social studies.  Formal tournaments are organized by local leagues, and on a national level by the Academic Games Leagues of America (AGLOA). Member leagues in eight states hold a national tournament every year, in which players in four divisions compete in eight different games covering math, English, and history. Some turn-based games require a kit consisting of a board and playing cubes, while other games have a central reader announcing questions or clues and each player answering individually.","image":"Academic_Games_League_of_America_logo.png.webp","url":"Academic_Games"}
