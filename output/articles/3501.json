{"title":"Covariance","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables.[1] If the greater values of one variable mainly correspond with the greater values of the other variable, and the same holds for the lesser values (that is, the variables tend to show similar behavior), the covariance is positive.[2] In the opposite case, when the greater values of one variable mainly correspond to the fewer values of the other, (that is, the variables tend to show opposite behavior), the covariance is negative. The sign of the covariance, therefore, shows the tendency in the linear relationship between the variables. The magnitude of the covariance is the geometric mean of the variances that are in-common for the two random variables. The correlation coefficient normalizes the covariance by dividing by the geometric mean of the total variances for the two random variables.","image":"Covariance_trends.svg.png.webp","url":"Covariance"}
