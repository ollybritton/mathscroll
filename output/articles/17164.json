{"title":"Zeta distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the zeta distribution is a discrete probability distribution. If X is a zeta-distributed random variable with parameter s, then the probability that X takes the integer value k is given by the probability mass function","image":"6951e38f735f8c7755132f39e71cc2a820843e3d.svg","url":"Zeta_distribution"}
