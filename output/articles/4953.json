{"title":"Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture","summary":"In graph theory, the unproven Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture, made in 1995 by the prolific mathematician Paul Erdős and his collaborator András Gyárfás, states that every graph with minimum degree 3 contains a simple cycle whose length is a power of two. Erdős offered a prize of $100 for proving the conjecture, or $50 for a counterexample; it is one of many conjectures of Erdős.","image":"Markström-Graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Erdős–Gyárfás_conjecture"}
