{"title":"Type (model theory)","summary":"In model theory and related areas of mathematics, a type is an object that describes how a (real or possible) element or finite collection of elements in a mathematical structure might behave.  More precisely, it is a set of first-order formulas in a language L with free variables x1, x2,â€¦, xn that are true of a set of n-tuples of an L-structure M {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}} .  Depending on the context, types can be complete or partial and they may use a fixed set of constants, A, from the structure M {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}} .  The question of which types represent actual elements of M {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}} leads to the ideas of saturated models and omitting types.","image":"2cc2abebd45ec020509a0ec548b67c9a2cb7cecd.svg","url":"Type_(model_theory)"}
