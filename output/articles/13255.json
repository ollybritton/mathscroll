{"title":"Reducing subspace","summary":"In linear algebra, a reducing subspace W {\\displaystyle W} of a linear map T : V → V {\\displaystyle T:V\\to V} from a Hilbert space V {\\displaystyle V} to itself is an invariant subspace of T {\\displaystyle T} whose orthogonal complement W ⊥ {\\displaystyle W^{\\perp }} is also an invariant subspace of T . {\\displaystyle T.} That is, T ( W ) ⊆ W {\\displaystyle T(W)\\subseteq W} and T ( W ⊥ ) ⊆ W ⊥ . {\\displaystyle T(W^{\\perp })\\subseteq W^{\\perp }.} One says that the subspace W {\\displaystyle W} reduces the map T . {\\displaystyle T.}","image":"54a9c4c547f4d6111f81946cad242b18298d70b7.svg","url":"Reducing_subspace"}
