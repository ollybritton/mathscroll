{"title":"Primitive element theorem","summary":"In field theory, the primitive element theorem is a result characterizing the finite degree field extensions that can be generated by a single element. Such a generating  element is called a primitive element of the field extension, and the extension is called a simple extension in this case. The theorem states that a finite extension is simple if and only if there are only finitely many intermediate fields. An older result, also often called \"primitive element theorem\", states that every finite separable extension is simple; it can be seen as a consequence of the former theorem.  These theorems imply in particular that all algebraic number fields over the rational numbers, and all extensions in which both fields are finite, are simple.","image":"f86227a53670608bf39758bc69a4529774756b64.svg","url":"Primitive_element_theorem"}
