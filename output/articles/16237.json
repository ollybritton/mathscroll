{"title":"Turán number","summary":"In mathematics, the   Turán number T(n,k,r) for  r-uniform hypergraphs of order n is the smallest number of r-edges such that every induced subgraph on k vertices contains an edge. This number was determined for r = 2 by Turán (1941), and the  problem for general r was introduced in Turán (1961). The paper (Sidorenko 1995) gives a survey of Turán numbers.","image":"e0d6ddfdd65a775124857466b6931bdc1a5424fc.svg","url":"Turán_number"}
