{"title":"Equation xy = yx","summary":"In general, exponentiation fails to be commutative. However, the equation x y = y x {\\displaystyle x^{y}=y^{x}} holds in special cases, such as x = 2 , y = 4. {\\displaystyle x=2,\\ y=4.} [1]","image":"cb42cf1af2004675fea9372a99a966ff4952f1c9.svg","url":"Equation_xy_=_yx"}
