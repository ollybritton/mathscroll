{"title":"Discrete Laplace operator","summary":"In mathematics, the discrete Laplace operator is an analog of the continuous Laplace operator, defined so that it has meaning on a graph or a discrete grid. For the case of a finite-dimensional graph (having a finite number of edges and vertices), the discrete Laplace operator is more commonly called the Laplacian matrix.","image":"644a8d85ee410b6159ca2bdb5dcb9097e2c8f182.svg","url":"Discrete_Laplace_operator"}
