{"title":"Slope number","summary":"In graph drawing and geometric graph theory, the slope number of a graph is the minimum possible number of distinct slopes of edges in a drawing of the graph in which vertices are represented as points in the Euclidean plane and edges are represented as line segments that do not pass through any non-incident vertex.","image":"Petersen_graph_with_slope_number_3.svg.png.webp","url":"Slope_number"}
