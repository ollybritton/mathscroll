{"title":"Hilbert's twelfth problem","summary":"Kronecker's Jugendtraum or Hilbert's twelfth problem, of the 23 mathematical Hilbert problems, is the extension of the Kroneckerâ€“Weber theorem on abelian extensions of the rational numbers, to any base number field. That is, it asks for analogues of the roots of unity, as complex numbers that are particular values of the exponential function; the requirement is that such numbers should generate a whole family of further number fields that are analogues of the cyclotomic fields and their subfields.","image":"4eeb29c282fb30147ba140ab3ce6e8ebbd7218aa.svg","url":"Hilbert's_twelfth_problem"}
