{"title":"Least common multiple","summary":"In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by lcm(a,Â b), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.[1][2]  Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different from zero.[3]  However, some authors define lcm(a, 0) as 0 for all a, since 0 is the only common multiple of a and 0.","image":"Symmetrical_5-set_Venn_diagram_LCM_2_3_4_5_7.svg.png.webp","url":"Least_common_multiple"}
