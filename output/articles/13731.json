{"title":"Roth's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Roth's theorem or Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem is a fundamental result in diophantine approximation to algebraic numbers. It is of a qualitative type, stating that algebraic numbers cannot have many rational number approximations that are 'very good'. Over half a century, the meaning of very good here was refined by a number of mathematicians, starting with Joseph Liouville in 1844 and continuing with work of Axel Thue (1909),  Carl Ludwig Siegel (1921), Freeman Dyson (1947), and Klaus Roth (1955).","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg","url":"Roth's_theorem"}
