{"title":"Backward stochastic differential equation","summary":"A backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) is a stochastic differential equation with a terminal condition in which the solution is required  to be adapted with respect to an underlying filtration. BSDEs naturally arise in various applications such as stochastic control, mathematical finance, and nonlinear Feynman-Kac formulae.[1]","image":"e39e90b9e1e7d5be3b5eae57729dc63494bbe3fd.svg","url":"Backward_stochastic_differential_equation"}
