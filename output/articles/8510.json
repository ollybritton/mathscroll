{"title":"József Kürschák","summary":"József Kürschák (14 March 1864 – 26 March 1933) was a Hungarian mathematician noted for his work on trigonometry and for his creation of the theory of valuations.[1] He proved that every valued field can be embedded into a complete valued field which is algebraically closed. In 1918 he proved that the sum of reciprocals of consecutive natural numbers is never an integer.[2] Extending Hilbert's argument, he proved that everything that can be constructed using a ruler and a compass, can be constructed by using a ruler and the ability of copying a fixed segment. He was elected a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1897. He was one of the main organisers of mathematics competitions, for example, Eötvös Loránd mathematics competition.[3]","image":"Matematikai_konferencia_Szegeden%2C_1928.jpg.webp","url":"József_Kürschák"}
