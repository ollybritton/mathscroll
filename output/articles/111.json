{"title":"6-simplex honeycomb","summary":"In six-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the 6-simplex honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). The tessellation fills space by 6-simplex, rectified 6-simplex, and birectified 6-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 1:1:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"6-simplex_honeycomb"}
