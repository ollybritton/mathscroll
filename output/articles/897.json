{"title":"Aperiodic graph","summary":"In the mathematical area of graph theory, a directed graph is said to be aperiodic if there is no integer k > 1 that divides the length of every cycle of the graph.  Equivalently, a graph is aperiodic if the greatest common divisor of the lengths of its cycles is one; this greatest common divisor for a graph G is called the period of G.","image":"Aperiodic-graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Aperiodic_graph"}
