{"title":"Geometric group theory","summary":"Geometric group theory is an area in mathematics devoted to the study of finitely generated groups via exploring the connections between algebraic properties of such groups and topological and geometric properties of spaces on which these groups act (that is, when the groups in question are realized as geometric symmetries or continuous transformations of some spaces).","image":"F2_Cayley_Graph.png.webp","url":"Geometric_group_theory"}
