{"title":"Riesz's lemma","summary":"Riesz's lemma (after Frigyes Riesz) is a lemma in functional analysis. It specifies (often easy to check) conditions that guarantee that a subspace in a normed vector space is dense. The lemma may also be called the Riesz lemma or Riesz inequality. It can be seen as a substitute for orthogonality when the normed space is not an inner product space.","image":"961d67d6b454b4df2301ac571808a3538b3a6d3f.svg","url":"Riesz's_lemma"}
