{"title":"Asplund space","summary":"In mathematics — specifically, in functional analysis — an Asplund space or strong differentiability space is a type of well-behaved Banach space.  Asplund spaces were introduced in 1968 by the mathematician Edgar Asplund, who was interested in the Fréchet differentiability properties of Lipschitz functions on Banach spaces.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Asplund_space"}
