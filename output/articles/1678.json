{"title":"Bipartite double cover","summary":"In graph theory, the bipartite double cover of an undirected graph G is a bipartite, covering graph of G, with twice as many vertices as G. It can be constructed as the tensor product of graphs, G Ã— K2. It is also called the Kronecker double cover, canonical double cover or simply the bipartite double of G.","image":"Covering-graph-2.svg.png.webp","url":"Bipartite_double_cover"}
