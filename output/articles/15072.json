{"title":"Stirling numbers of the second kind","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in combinatorics, a Stirling number of the second kind (or Stirling partition number) is the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets and is denoted by S ( n , k ) {\\displaystyle S(n,k)} or { n k } {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\left\\{{n \\atop k}\\right\\}} .[1] Stirling numbers of the second kind occur in the field of  mathematics called combinatorics and the study of partitions.","image":"7e175d023088543773687c25fa875528f091ed34.svg","url":"Stirling_numbers_of_the_second_kind"}
