{"title":"Catenoid","summary":"In geometry, a catenoid is a type of surface, arising by rotating a catenary curve about an axis (a surface of revolution).[1] It is a minimal surface, meaning that it occupies the least area when bounded by a closed space.[2] It was formally described in 1744 by the mathematician Leonhard Euler.","image":"Catenoid.svg.png.webp","url":"Catenoid"}
