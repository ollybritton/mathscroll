{"title":"Siegel's lemma","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in transcendental number theory and Diophantine approximation, Siegel's lemma refers to bounds on the solutions of linear equations obtained by the construction of auxiliary functions. The existence of these polynomials was proven by Axel Thue;[1] Thue's proof used Dirichlet's box principle. Carl Ludwig Siegel published his lemma in 1929.[2]  It is a pure existence theorem for a system of linear equations.","image":"2405a633b7e3171460e3fd78345c945250387964.svg","url":"Siegel's_lemma"}
