{"title":"Discrete wavelet transform","summary":"In numerical analysis and functional analysis, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is any wavelet transform for which the wavelets are discretely sampled. As with other wavelet transforms, a key advantage it has over Fourier transforms is temporal resolution: it captures both frequency and location information (location in time).","image":"Jpeg2000_2-level_wavelet_transform-lichtenstein.png.webp","url":"Discrete_wavelet_transform"}
