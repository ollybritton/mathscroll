{"title":"Muller plot","summary":"A Muller plot, also known as Muller diagram, combines information about the succession of different operational taxonomic units (OTUs)—such as genotypes, phenotypes, or species—and information about dynamics of their abundances (populations or frequencies) over time. Muller plots may be used to visualize evolutionary dynamics.[1][2] They may be also employed in the study of diversity and its dynamics; that is, how diversity emerges and how it changes over time.","image":"Mullerplot.png.webp","url":"Muller_plot"}
