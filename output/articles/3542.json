{"title":"Credibility theory","summary":"Credibility theory is a branch of actuarial mathematics concerned with determining risk premiums.[1] It is employed to combine multiple estimates into a summary estimate that takes into account information on the accuracy of the initial estimates. For example, in group health insurance an insurer is interested in calculating the risk premium, R P {\\displaystyle RP} , (i.e. the theoretical expected claims amount) for a particular employer in the coming year. The insurer will likely have an estimate of historical overall claims experience, x {\\displaystyle x} , as well as a more specific estimate for the employer in question, y {\\displaystyle y} . Assigning a credibility factor, z {\\displaystyle z} , to the overall claims experience (and the reciprocal to employer experience) allows the insurer to get a more accurate estimate of the risk premium in the following manner:","image":"3e6ee2dec8276007eca18596d7bf5a7aeac64e7b.svg","url":"Credibility_theory"}
