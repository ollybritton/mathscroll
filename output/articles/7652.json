{"title":"Illegal number","summary":"An illegal number is a number that represents information which is illegal to possess, utter, propagate, or otherwise transmit in some legal jurisdiction. Any piece of digital information is representable as a number; consequently, if communicating a specific set of information is illegal in some way, then the number may be illegal as well.[1][2][3]","image":"Sample_09-F9_protest_art%2C_Free_Speech_Flag_by_John_Marcotte.svg.png.webp","url":"Illegal_number"}
