{"title":"Alexiewicz norm","summary":"In mathematics — specifically, in integration theory — the Alexiewicz norm is an integral norm associated to the Henstock–Kurzweil integral.  The Alexiewicz norm turns the space of Henstock–Kurzweil integrable functions into a topological vector space that is barrelled but not complete.  The Alexiewicz norm is named after the Polish mathematician Andrzej Alexiewicz, who introduced it in 1948.","image":"449442f842777d3317a4099194459bb4100fd420.svg","url":"Alexiewicz_norm"}
