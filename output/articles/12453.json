{"title":"Predictable process","summary":"In stochastic analysis, a part of the mathematical theory of probability, a predictable process is a stochastic process whose value is knowable at a prior time.  The predictable processes form the smallest class that is closed under taking limits of sequences and contains all adapted left-continuous processes.","image":"4935fd734f7e64a4f89f350430b131ba2ee5a3b6.svg","url":"Predictable_process"}
