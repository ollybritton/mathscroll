{"title":"Mealy machine","summary":"In the theory of computation, a Mealy machine is a finite-state machine whose output values are determined both by its current state and the current inputs. This is in contrast to a Moore machine, whose output values are determined solely by its current state. A Mealy machine is a deterministic finite-state transducer: for each state and input, at most one transition is possible.","image":"7acb184f51d3db350303cd47a471d19a4b04c0e1.svg","url":"Mealy_machine"}
