{"title":"Category (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a category (sometimes called an abstract category to distinguish it from a concrete category) is a collection of \"objects\" that are linked by \"arrows\". A category has two basic properties: the ability to compose the arrows associatively and the existence of an identity arrow for each object.  A simple example is the category of sets, whose objects are sets and whose arrows are functions.","image":"Category_SVG.svg.png.webp","url":"Category_(mathematics)"}
