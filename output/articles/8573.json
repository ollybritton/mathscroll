{"title":"Kanamori–McAloon theorem","summary":"In mathematical logic, the Kanamori–McAloon theorem, due to Kanamori & McAloon (1987), gives an example of an incompleteness in Peano arithmetic, similar to that of the Paris–Harrington theorem. They showed that a certain finitistic theorem in Ramsey theory is not provable in Peano arithmetic (PA).","image":"117736c618c3241c7bf204db12b10d2f9068d03b.svg","url":"Kanamori–McAloon_theorem"}
