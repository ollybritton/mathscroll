{"title":"Multiple integral","summary":"In mathematics (specifically multivariable calculus), a multiple integral is a definite integral of a function of several real variables, for instance, f(x, y) or f(x, y, z). Integrals of a function of two variables over a region in R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} (the real-number plane) are called double integrals, and integrals of a function of three variables over a region in R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} (real-number 3D space) are called triple integrals.[1] For multiple integrals of a single-variable function, see the Cauchy formula for repeated integration.","image":"e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd.svg","url":"Multiple_integral"}
