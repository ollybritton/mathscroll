{"title":"Effect algebra","summary":"Effect algebras are  partial algebras which abstract the (partial) algebraic properties of events that can be observed in quantum mechanics. Structures equivalent to effect algebras were introduced by three different research groups in theoretical physics or mathematics in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since then, their mathematical properties and physical as well as computational significance have been studied by researchers in theoretical physics, mathematics and computer science.","image":"8b9a5b16c80e28e48322cb621b6c445cb68fcaf2.svg","url":"Effect_algebra"}
