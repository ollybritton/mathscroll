{"title":"Stack-sortable permutation","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, a stack-sortable permutation (also called a tree permutation)[1] is a permutation whose elements may be sorted by an algorithm whose internal storage is limited to a single stack data structure. The stack-sortable permutations are exactly the permutations that do not contain the permutation pattern 231; they are counted by the Catalan numbers, and may be placed in bijection with many other combinatorial objects with the same counting function including Dyck paths and binary trees.","image":"a0d98ac30d7bfc614f59144562682f56fd7833b9.svg","url":"Stack-sortable_permutation"}
