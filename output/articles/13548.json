{"title":"Riemannian Penrose inequality","summary":"In mathematical general relativity, the Penrose inequality, first conjectured by Sir Roger Penrose, estimates the mass of a spacetime in terms of the total area of its black holes and is a generalization of the positive mass theorem.  The Riemannian Penrose inequality is an important special case.  Specifically, if (M,Â g) is an asymptotically flat Riemannian 3-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature and ADM mass m, and A is the area of the outermost minimal surface (possibly with multiple connected components), then the Riemannian Penrose inequality asserts","image":"c1868f44b8bdd9e7d644e20f0385a1490e801818.svg","url":"Riemannian_Penrose_inequality"}
