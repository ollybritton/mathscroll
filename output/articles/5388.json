{"title":"Fibonacci cube","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Fibonacci cubes or Fibonacci networks are a family of undirected graphs with rich recursive properties derived from its origin in number theory. Mathematically they are similar to the hypercube graphs, but with a Fibonacci number of vertices. Fibonacci cubes were first explicitly defined in Hsu (1993) in the context of interconnection topologies for connecting parallel or distributed systems.  They have also been applied in chemical graph theory.","image":"FibboCube.png.webp","url":"Fibonacci_cube"}
