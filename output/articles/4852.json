{"title":"Ensemble (mathematical physics)","summary":"In physics, specifically statistical mechanics, an ensemble (also statistical ensemble) is an idealization consisting of a large number of virtual copies (sometimes infinitely many) of a system, considered all at once, each of which represents a possible state that the real system might be in. In other words, a statistical ensemble is a set of systems of particles used in statistical mechanics to describe a single system.[1] The concept of an ensemble was introduced by J. Willard Gibbs in 1902.[2]","image":"Increasing_disorder.svg.png.webp","url":"Ensemble_(mathematical_physics)"}
