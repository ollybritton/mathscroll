{"title":"Great complex icosidodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the great complex icosidodecahedron is a degenerate uniform star polyhedron. It has 12 vertices, and 60 (doubled) edges, and 32 faces, 12 pentagrams and 20 triangles.  All edges are doubled (making it degenerate), sharing 4 faces, but are considered as two overlapping edges as topological polyhedron.","image":"Great_complex_icosidodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Great_complex_icosidodecahedron"}
