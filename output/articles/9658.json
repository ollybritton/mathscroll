{"title":"Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities","summary":"In mathematics,  logarithmic Sobolev inequalities are a class of inequalities involving the norm of a function f, its logarithm, and its gradient âˆ‡ f {\\displaystyle \\nabla f} . These inequalities were discovered and named by Leonard Gross, who established them [1][2] in dimension-independent form, in the context of constructive quantum field theory. Similar results were discovered by other mathematicians before and many variations on such inequalities are known.","image":"b7b4d6de89b52c5a5e6e1583cb63eaee263e307b.svg","url":"Logarithmic_Sobolev_inequalities"}
