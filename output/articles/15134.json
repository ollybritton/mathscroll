{"title":"String graph","summary":"In graph theory, a string graph is an intersection graph of curves in the plane; each curve is called a \"string\". Given a graph G, G is a string graph if and only if there exists a set of curves, or strings, such that the graph having a vertex for each curve and an edge for each intersecting pair of curves is isomorphic to G.","image":"Planar_string_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"String_graph"}
