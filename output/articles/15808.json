{"title":"Time–frequency analysis","summary":"In signal processing, time–frequency analysis comprises those techniques that study a signal in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously, using various time–frequency representations. Rather than viewing a 1-dimensional signal (a function, real or complex-valued, whose domain is the real line) and some transform (another function whose domain is the real line, obtained from the original via some transform), time–frequency analysis studies a two-dimensional signal – a function whose domain is the two-dimensional real plane, obtained from the signal via a time–frequency transform.[1][2]","image":"d306721fd7141ba444ca1544e96569df2a1ecc48.svg","url":"Time–frequency_analysis"}
