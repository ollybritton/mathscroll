{"title":"Ternary plot","summary":"A ternary plot, ternary graph, triangle plot, simplex plot, Gibbs triangle or de Finetti diagram is a barycentric plot on three variables which sum to a constant.[1] It graphically depicts the ratios of the three variables as positions in an equilateral triangle. It is used in physical chemistry, petrology, mineralogy, metallurgy, and other physical sciences to show the compositions of systems composed of three species. In population genetics, a triangle plot of genotype frequencies is called a de Finetti diagram. In game theory, it is often called a simplex plot.[2] Ternary plots are tools for analyzing compositional data in the three-dimensional case.","image":"Flammability_diagram_methane.svg.png.webp","url":"Ternary_plot"}
