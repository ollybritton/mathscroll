{"title":"Octagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the octagonal tiling is a regular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It is represented by Schl√§fli symbol of {8,3}, having three regular octagons around each vertex. It also has a construction as a truncated order-8 square tiling, t{4,8}.","image":"H2-8-3-dual.svg.png.webp","url":"Octagonal_tiling"}
