{"title":"Dvoretzky's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Dvoretzky's theorem is an important structural theorem about normed vector spaces proved by Aryeh Dvoretzky in the early 1960s,[1] answering a question of Alexander Grothendieck. In essence, it says that every sufficiently high-dimensional normed vector space will have low-dimensional subspaces that are approximately Euclidean. Equivalently, every high-dimensional bounded symmetric convex set has low-dimensional sections that are approximately ellipsoids.","image":"3f436db4760473bc67e026019b090010e423ffa5.svg","url":"Dvoretzky's_theorem"}
