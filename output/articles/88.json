{"title":"5-cell","summary":"In geometry, the 5-cell is the convex 4-polytope with Schläfli symbol {3,3,3}. It is a 5-vertex four-dimensional object bounded by five tetrahedral cells.[lower-alpha 1] It is also known as a C5, pentachoron,[1] pentatope, pentahedroid,[2] or tetrahedral pyramid. It is the 4-simplex (Coxeter's α 4 {\\displaystyle \\alpha _{4}} polytope),[3] the simplest possible convex 4-polytope, and is analogous to the tetrahedron in three dimensions and the triangle in two dimensions. The 5-cell is a 4-dimensional pyramid with a tetrahedral base and four tetrahedral sides.","image":"c16673a84bde8045075ef85aaa4232b8b2c8d4be.svg","url":"5-cell"}
