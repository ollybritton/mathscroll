{"title":"Selberg class","summary":"In mathematics, the Selberg class is an axiomatic definition of a class of L-functions.  The members of the class are Dirichlet series which obey four axioms that seem to capture the essential properties satisfied by most functions that are commonly called L-functions or zeta functions.  Although the exact nature of the class is conjectural, the hope is that the definition of the class will lead to a classification of its contents and an elucidation of its properties, including insight into their relationship to automorphic forms and the Riemann hypothesis.  The class was defined by Atle Selberg in (Selberg 1992), who preferred not to use the word \"axiom\" that later authors have employed.[1]","image":"349546b92df0cff786a8207b59ae3553be438e9d.svg","url":"Selberg_class"}
