{"title":"Anytime A*","summary":"In computer science, anytime A* is a family of variants of the A* search algorithm. Like other anytime algorithms, it has a flexible time cost, can return a valid solution to a pathfinding or graph traversal problem even if it is interrupted before it ends, by generating a fast, non-optimal solution before progressively optimizing it. This ability to quickly generate solutions has made it attractive to Search-base sites and AI designs.","image":"Weighted_A_star_with_eps_5.gif","url":"Anytime_A*"}
