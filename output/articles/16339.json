{"title":"Unified strength theory","summary":"The unified strength theory (UST).[1][2][3][4] proposed by Yu Mao-Hong is a series of yield criteria (see yield surface) and failure criteria (see Material failure theory). It is a generalized classical strength theory which can be used to describe the yielding or failure of material begins when the combination of principal stresses reaches a critical value.[5][6][7]","image":"e898be62a0c19f6bbe1c7bbb34cb43b237034e29.svg","url":"Unified_strength_theory"}
