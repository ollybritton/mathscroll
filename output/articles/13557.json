{"title":"Riemann–Lebesgue lemma","summary":"In mathematics, the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma, named after Bernhard Riemann and Henri Lebesgue, states that the Fourier transform or Laplace transform of an L1 function vanishes at infinity. It is of importance in harmonic analysis and asymptotic analysis.","image":"d18f6a375b29725466fd705ddd852c78b6969a9b.svg","url":"Riemann–Lebesgue_lemma"}
