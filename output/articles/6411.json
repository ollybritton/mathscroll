{"title":"Graded manifold","summary":"In algebraic geometry, graded manifolds are extensions of the concept of manifolds based on ideas coming from supersymmetry and supercommutative algebra. Both graded manifolds and supermanifolds are phrased in terms of sheaves of graded commutative algebras. However, graded manifolds are characterized by sheaves on smooth manifolds, while supermanifolds are constructed by gluing of sheaves of supervector spaces.","image":"c946bd96d771a37a141d9eabe7ceea04f084158b.svg","url":"Graded_manifold"}
