{"title":"Feldman–Hájek theorem","summary":"In probability theory, the Feldman–Hájek theorem or Feldman–Hájek dichotomy is a fundamental result in the theory of Gaussian measures.  It states that two Gaussian measures μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } and ν {\\displaystyle \\nu } on a locally convex space X {\\displaystyle X} are either equivalent measures or else mutually singular:[1]  there is no possibility of an intermediate situation in which, for example, μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } has a density with respect to ν {\\displaystyle \\nu } but not vice versa.  In the special case that X {\\displaystyle X} is a Hilbert space, it is possible to give an explicit description of the circumstances under which μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } and ν {\\displaystyle \\nu } are equivalent:  writing m μ {\\displaystyle m_{\\mu }} and m ν {\\displaystyle m_{\\nu }} for the means of μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } and ν , {\\displaystyle \\nu ,} and C μ {\\displaystyle C_{\\mu }} and C ν {\\displaystyle C_{\\nu }} for their covariance operators, equivalence of μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } and ν {\\displaystyle \\nu } holds if and only if[2]","image":"9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161.svg","url":"Feldman–Hájek_theorem"}
