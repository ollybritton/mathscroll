{"title":"Packing density","summary":"A packing density or packing fraction of a packing in some space is the fraction of the space filled by the figures making up the packing. In simplest terms, this is the ratio of the volume of bodies in a space to the volume of the space itself. In packing problems, the objective is usually to obtain a packing of the greatest possible density.","image":"ea422c4844ea4d1db2a5403b15d4b850ae4a2a49.svg","url":"Packing_density"}
