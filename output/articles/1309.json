{"title":"Band (order theory)","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, a band in a vector lattice X {\\displaystyle X} is a subspace M {\\displaystyle M} of X {\\displaystyle X} that is solid and such that for all S ⊆ M {\\displaystyle S\\subseteq M} such that x = sup S {\\displaystyle x=\\sup S} exists in X , {\\displaystyle X,} we have x ∈ M . {\\displaystyle x\\in M.} [1] The smallest band containing a subset S {\\displaystyle S} of X {\\displaystyle X} is called the band generated by S {\\displaystyle S} in X . {\\displaystyle X.} [1] A band generated by a singleton set is called a principal band.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Band_(order_theory)"}
