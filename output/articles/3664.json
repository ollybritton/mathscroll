{"title":"Cuspidal representation","summary":"In number theory, cuspidal representations are certain representations of algebraic groups that occur discretely in L 2 {\\displaystyle L^{2}} spaces. The term cuspidal is derived, at a certain distance, from the cusp forms of classical modular form theory. In the contemporary formulation of automorphic representations, representations take the place of holomorphic functions; these representations may be of adelic algebraic groups.","image":"ba162c66ca85776c83557af5088cc6f8584d1912.svg","url":"Cuspidal_representation"}
