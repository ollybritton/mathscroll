{"title":"Probabilistic Turing machine","summary":"In theoretical computer science, a probabilistic Turing machine is a non-deterministic Turing machine that chooses between the available transitions at each point according to some probability distribution. As a consequence, a probabilistic Turing machine can—unlike a deterministic Turing Machine—have stochastic results; that is, on a given input and instruction state machine, it may have different run times, or it may not halt at all; furthermore, it may accept an input in one execution and reject the same input in another execution.","image":"6fd6c65cdd5db3f5ff59dfabfcf52219fb561510.svg","url":"Probabilistic_Turing_machine"}
