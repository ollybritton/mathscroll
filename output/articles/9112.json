{"title":"Least-upper-bound property","summary":"In mathematics, the least-upper-bound property (sometimes called completeness or supremum property or l.u.b. property)[1] is a fundamental property of the real numbers. More generally, a partially ordered set X has the least-upper-bound property if every non-empty subset of X with an upper bound has a least upper bound (supremum) in X. Not every (partially) ordered set has the least upper bound property. For example, the set Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } of all rational numbers with its natural order does not have the least upper bound property.","image":"c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a.svg","url":"Least-upper-bound_property"}
