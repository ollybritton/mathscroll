{"title":"Gaussian measure","summary":"In mathematics, Gaussian measure is a Borel measure on finite-dimensional Euclidean space Rn, closely related to the normal distribution in statistics. There is also a generalization to infinite-dimensional spaces. Gaussian measures are named after the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. One reason why Gaussian measures are so ubiquitous in probability theory is the central limit theorem. Loosely speaking, it states that if a random variable X is obtained by summing a large number N of independent random variables of order 1, then X is of order N {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {N}}} and its law is approximately Gaussian.","image":"7b3d8948b2c154ccc7f7523b035ae7e254e04190.svg","url":"Gaussian_measure"}
