{"title":"Fedosov manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a Fedosov manifold is a symplectic manifold with a compatible torsion-free connection, that is, a triple (M, ω, ∇), where (M, ω) is a symplectic manifold (that is, ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } is a symplectic form, a non-degenerate closed exterior 2-form, on a C ∞ {\\displaystyle C^{\\infty }} -manifold M), and ∇ is a symplectic torsion-free connection on M . {\\displaystyle M.} [1] (A connection ∇ is called compatible or symplectic if X ⋅ ω(Y,Z) = ω(∇XY,Z) + ω(Y,∇XZ) for all vector fields X,Y,Z ∈ Γ(TM). In other words, the symplectic form is parallel with respect to the connection, i.e., its covariant derivative vanishes.) Note that every symplectic manifold admits a symplectic torsion-free connection. Cover the manifold with Darboux charts and on each chart define a connection ∇ with Christoffel symbol Γ j k i = 0 {\\displaystyle \\Gamma _{jk}^{i}=0} .  Then choose a partition of unity (subordinate to the cover) and glue the local connections together to a global connection which still preserves the symplectic form. The famous result of Boris Vasilievich Fedosov gives a canonical deformation quantization of a Fedosov manifold.[2]","image":"48eff443f9de7a985bb94ca3bde20813ea737be8.svg","url":"Fedosov_manifold"}
