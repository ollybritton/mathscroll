{"title":"Spherical basis","summary":"In pure and applied mathematics, particularly quantum mechanics and computer graphics and their applications, a spherical basis is the basis used to express spherical tensors.  The spherical basis closely relates to the description of angular momentum in quantum mechanics and spherical harmonic functions.","image":"f8bae56da4c12fd5c02b7b6275e11f79bb25514a.svg","url":"Spherical_basis"}
