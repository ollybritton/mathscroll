{"title":"Hecke operator","summary":"In mathematics, in particular in the theory of modular forms, a Hecke operator, studied by Erich HeckeÂ (1937a,1937b), is a certain kind of \"averaging\" operator that plays a significant role in the structure of vector spaces of modular forms and more general automorphic representations.","image":"cd083cf7226e6e5fae39cb81d3665f3954f47cf2.svg","url":"Hecke_operator"}
