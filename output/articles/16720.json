{"title":"Wall's finiteness obstruction","summary":"In geometric topology, a field within mathematics, the obstruction to a finitely dominated space X being homotopy-equivalent to a finite CW-complex is its Wall finiteness obstruction w(X) which is an element in the reduced zeroth algebraic K-theory K ~ 0 ( Z [ π 1 ( X ) ] ) {\\displaystyle {\\widetilde {K}}_{0}(\\mathbb {Z} [\\pi _{1}(X)])} of the integral group ring Z [ π 1 ( X ) ] {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} [\\pi _{1}(X)]} . It is named after the mathematician C. T. C. Wall.","image":"1a3b62659e90c603473377e7852fdec8ce74a5a5.svg","url":"Wall's_finiteness_obstruction"}
