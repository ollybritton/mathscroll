{"title":"Cayley–Menger determinant","summary":"In linear algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, the Cayley–Menger determinant is a formula for the content, i.e. the higher-dimensional volume, of a n {\\textstyle n} -dimensional simplex in terms of the squares of all of the distances between pairs of its vertices. The determinant is named after Arthur Cayley and Karl Menger.","image":"cc6e1f880981346a604257ebcacdef24c0aca2d6.svg","url":"Cayley–Menger_determinant"}
