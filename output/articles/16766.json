{"title":"Weak dimension","summary":"In abstract algebra, the weak dimension of a nonzero right module M over a ring R is the largest number n such that the Tor group Tor n R ⁡ ( M , N ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Tor} _{n}^{R}(M,N)} is nonzero for some left R-module N (or infinity if no largest such n exists), and the weak dimension of a left R-module is defined similarly. The weak dimension was introduced by Henri Cartan and Samuel Eilenberg (1956, p.122). The weak dimension is sometimes called the flat dimension as it is the shortest length of a resolution of the module by flat modules. The weak dimension of a module is at most equal to its projective dimension.","image":"b90659da23f2d9b2e81463e8e563bf5c34e78eb0.svg","url":"Weak_dimension"}
