{"title":"Lyndon–Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the fields of group cohomology, homological algebra and number theory, the Lyndon spectral sequence or Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence is a spectral sequence relating the group cohomology of a normal subgroup N and the quotient group G/N to the cohomology of the total group G.  The spectral sequence is named after Roger Lyndon, Gerhard Hochschild, and Jean-Pierre Serre.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Lyndon–Hochschild–Serre_spectral_sequence"}
