{"title":"Convex conjugate","summary":"In mathematics and mathematical optimization, the convex conjugate of a function is a generalization of the Legendre transformation which applies to non-convex functions. It is also known as Legendreâ€“Fenchel transformation, Fenchel transformation, or Fenchel conjugate (after Adrien-Marie Legendre and Werner Fenchel).  It allows in particular for a far reaching generalization of Lagrangian duality.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Convex_conjugate"}
