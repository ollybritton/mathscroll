{"title":"Poincaré inequality","summary":"In mathematics, the Poincaré inequality[1] is a result in the theory of Sobolev spaces, named after the French mathematician Henri Poincaré. The inequality allows one to obtain bounds on a function using bounds on its derivatives and the geometry of its domain of definition. Such bounds are of great importance in the modern, direct methods of the calculus of variations. A very closely related result is Friedrichs' inequality.","image":"f264331d7c9198bb212f35a5f61b2ca10cac37e7.svg","url":"Poincaré_inequality"}
