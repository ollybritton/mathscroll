{"title":"Buchberger's algorithm","summary":"In the theory of multivariate polynomials, Buchberger's algorithm is a method for transforming a given set of polynomials into a Gröbner basis, which is another set of polynomials that have the same common zeros and are more convenient for extracting information on these common zeros. It was introduced by Bruno Buchberger simultaneously with the definition of Gröbner bases.","image":"1fd0d6fcb4960bec8b139de587f4641fc237a92e.svg","url":"Buchberger's_algorithm"}
