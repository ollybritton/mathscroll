{"title":"Collectionwise normal space","summary":"In mathematics, a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} is called collectionwise normal if for every discrete family Fi (i ∈ I) of closed subsets of X {\\displaystyle X} there exists a pairwise disjoint family of open sets Ui (i ∈ I), such that Fi ⊆ Ui.  Here a family F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} of subsets of X {\\displaystyle X} is called discrete when every point of X {\\displaystyle X} has a neighbourhood that intersects at most one of the sets from F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} . An equivalent definition [1] of collectionwise normal demands that the above Ui (i ∈ I) themselves form a discrete family, which is stronger than pairwise disjoint.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Collectionwise_normal_space"}
