{"title":"Pure spinor","summary":"In the domain of mathematics known as representation theory, pure spinors (or simple spinors) are spinors that are annihilated under the Clifford action by a maximal isotropic subspace of the space V {\\displaystyle V} of vectors with respect to the scalar product determining the Clifford algebra. They were introduced by Ã‰lie Cartan  [1] in the 1930s to classify complex structures. Pure spinors were a key ingredient in the study of spin geometry and twistor theory, introduced by Roger Penrose in the 1960s.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Pure_spinor"}
