{"title":"Agmon's inequality","summary":"In mathematical analysis, Agmon's inequalities, named after Shmuel Agmon,[1]  consist of two closely related interpolation inequalities between the Lebesgue space L âˆž {\\displaystyle L^{\\infty }} and the Sobolev spaces H s {\\displaystyle H^{s}} .  It is useful in the study of partial differential equations.","image":"b9ab400cc4dfd865180cd84c72dc894ca457671f.svg","url":"Agmon's_inequality"}
