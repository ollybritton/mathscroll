{"title":"Local boundedness","summary":"In mathematics, a function is locally bounded if it is bounded around every point. A family of functions is locally bounded if for any point in their domain all the functions are bounded around that point and by the same number.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Local_boundedness"}
