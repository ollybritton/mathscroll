{"title":"Dual quaternion","summary":"In mathematics, the dual quaternions are an 8-dimensional real algebra isomorphic to the tensor product of the quaternions and the dual numbers.  Thus, they may be constructed in the same way as the quaternions, except using dual numbers instead of real numbers as coefficients.  A dual quaternion can be represented in the form A + εB, where A and B are ordinary quaternions and ε is the dual unit, which satisfies ε2 = 0 and commutes with every element of the algebra. Unlike quaternions, the dual quaternions do not form a division algebra.","image":"Quaternion_Plaque_on_Broom_Bridge.jpg.webp","url":"Dual_quaternion"}
