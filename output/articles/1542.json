{"title":"Beth number","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in set theory, the beth numbers are a certain sequence of infinite cardinal numbers (also known as transfinite numbers), conventionally written ℶ 0 , ℶ 1 , ℶ 2 , ℶ 3 , … {\\displaystyle \\beth _{0},\\ \\beth _{1},\\ \\beth _{2},\\ \\beth _{3},\\ \\dots } , where ℶ {\\displaystyle \\beth } is the second Hebrew letter (beth). The beth numbers are related to the aleph numbers ( ℵ 0 , ℵ 1 , … {\\displaystyle \\aleph _{0},\\ \\aleph _{1},\\ \\dots } ), but unless the generalized continuum hypothesis is true, there are numbers indexed by ℵ {\\displaystyle \\aleph } that are not indexed by ℶ {\\displaystyle \\beth } .","image":"ec9f29597e97dc985b8d57c521860849dea42066.svg","url":"Beth_number"}
