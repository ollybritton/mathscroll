{"title":"History of group theory","summary":"The history of group theory, a mathematical domain studying groups in their various forms, has evolved in various parallel threads. There are three historical roots of group theory: the theory of algebraic equations, number theory and geometry.[1][2][3] Joseph Louis Lagrange, Niels Henrik Abel and Ã‰variste Galois were early researchers in the field of group theory.","image":"e64e2a4a5b6cb58f1553c6a65551b4898bb82403.svg","url":"History_of_group_theory"}
