{"title":"Separated sets","summary":"In topology and related branches of mathematics, separated sets are pairs of subsets of a given topological space that are related to each other in a certain way: roughly speaking, neither overlapping nor touching.  The notion of when two sets are separated or not is important both to the notion of connected spaces (and their connected components) as well as to the separation axioms for topological spaces.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Separated_sets"}
