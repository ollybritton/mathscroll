{"title":"Multinomial probit","summary":"In statistics and econometrics, the multinomial probit model is a generalization of the probit model used when there are several possible categories that the dependent variable can fall into. As such, it is an alternative to the multinomial logit model  as one method of multiclass classification. It is not to be confused with the multivariate probit model, which is used to model correlated binary outcomes for more than one independent variable.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Multinomial_probit"}
