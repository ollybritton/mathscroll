{"title":"sl2-triple","summary":"In the theory of Lie algebras, an  sl2-triple is a triple of elements of a Lie algebra that satisfy the commutation relations between the standard generators of the special linear Lie algebra sl2. This notion plays an important role in the theory of semisimple Lie algebras, especially in regard to their nilpotent orbits.","image":"34066b184e903265f89f7e70284ba80db8d8282a.svg","url":"Sl2-triple"}
