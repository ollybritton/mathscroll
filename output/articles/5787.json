{"title":"Fréchet filter","summary":"In mathematics, the Fréchet filter, also called the cofinite filter, on a set X {\\displaystyle X} is a certain collection of subsets of X {\\displaystyle X} (that is, it is a particular subset of the power set of X {\\displaystyle X} ). A subset F {\\displaystyle F} of X {\\displaystyle X} belongs to the Fréchet filter if and only if the complement of F {\\displaystyle F} in X {\\displaystyle X} is finite. Any such set F {\\displaystyle F} is said to be cofinite in X {\\displaystyle X} , which is why it is alternatively called the cofinite filter on X {\\displaystyle X} .","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Fréchet_filter"}
