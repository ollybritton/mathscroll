{"title":"Kind (type theory)","summary":"In the area of mathematical logic and computer science known as type theory, a kind is the type of a type constructor or, less commonly, the type of a higher-order type operator. A kind system is essentially a simply typed lambda calculus \"one level up\", endowed with a primitive type, denoted âˆ— {\\displaystyle *} and called \"type\", which is the kind of any data type which does not need any type parameters.","image":"8e9972f426d9e07855984f73ee195a21dbc21755.svg","url":"Kind_(type_theory)"}
