{"title":"Abu'l-Hasan ibn Ali al-Qalasadi","summary":"Abū'l-Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Qurashī al-Qalaṣādī (Arabic: أبو الحسن علي بن محمد بن علي القرشي البسطي; 1412–1486[1]) was a Muslim Arab[2] mathematician from Al-Andalus specializing in Islamic inheritance jurisprudence. Franz Woepcke stated that al-Qalaṣādī was known as one of the most influential voices in algebraic notation for taking \"the first steps toward the introduction of algebraic symbolism''. He wrote numerous books on arithmetic and algebra, including al-Tabsira fi'lm al-hisab (Arabic: التبصير في علم الحساب \"Clarification of the science of arithmetic\").[1]","image":"Granada_by_Piri_Reis.jpg.webp","url":"Abu'l-Hasan_ibn_Ali_al-Qalasadi"}
