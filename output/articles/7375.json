{"title":"Homoscedasticity and heteroscedasticity","summary":"In statistics, a sequence (or a vector) of random variables is homoscedastic (/ˌhoʊmoʊskəˈdæstɪk/) if all its random variables have the same finite variance; this is also known as homogeneity of variance. The complementary notion is called heteroscedasticity, also known as heterogeneity of variance. The spellings homoskedasticity and heteroskedasticity are also frequently used.[1][2][3] Assuming a  variable is homoscedastic when in reality it is heteroscedastic (/ˌhɛtəroʊskəˈdæstɪk/) results in unbiased but inefficient point estimates and in biased estimates of standard errors, and may result in overestimating the goodness of fit as measured by the Pearson coefficient.","image":"Homoscedasticity.png.webp","url":"Homoscedasticity_and_heteroscedasticity"}
