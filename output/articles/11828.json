{"title":"Partial cube","summary":"In graph theory, a partial cube is a graph that is isometric to a subgraph of a hypercube.[1] In other words, a partial cube can be identified with a subgraph of a hypercube in such a way that the distance between any two vertices in the partial cube is the same as the distance between those vertices in the hypercube. Equivalently, a partial cube is a graph whose vertices can be labeled with bit strings of equal length in such a way that the distance between two vertices in the graph is equal to the Hamming distance between their labels. Such a labeling is called a Hamming labeling; it represents an isometric embedding of the partial cube into a hypercube.","image":"2SAT_median_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Partial_cube"}
