{"title":"Euler system","summary":"In mathematics, an Euler system is a collection of compatible elements of Galois cohomology groups indexed by fields.  They were introduced by KolyvaginÂ (1990) in his work on Heegner points on modular elliptic curves, which was motivated by his earlier paper Kolyvagin (1988) and  the work of Thaine (1988).  Euler systems are named after Leonhard Euler because  the factors relating different elements of an Euler system resemble the Euler factors of an Euler product.","image":"dc8e6db4f296c124199e6ef65178cae4b7182419.svg","url":"Euler_system"}
