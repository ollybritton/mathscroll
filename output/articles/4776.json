{"title":"Elongated pentagonal cupola","summary":"In geometry, the elongated pentagonal cupola is one of the Johnson solids (J20). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal cupola (J5) by attaching a decagonal prism to its base. The solid can also be seen as an elongated pentagonal orthobicupola (J38) with its \"lid\" (another pentagonal cupola) removed.","image":"Elongated_pentagonal_cupola.png.webp","url":"Elongated_pentagonal_cupola"}
