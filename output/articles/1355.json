{"title":"Base ten block","summary":"Base ten blocks, also known as multibase arithmetic blocks (MAB) or Dienes blocks (after their creator, mathematician and educationalist Zoltán Pál Dienes), are a mathematical manipulative used by students to learn basic mathematical concepts including addition, subtraction, number sense, place value and counting. The student can manipulate the blocks in different ways to express numbers and patterns. Generally, the three-dimensional blocks are made of a solid material such as plastic or wood and come in four sizes to indicate their individual place value: Units (ones place), Longs (tens place), Flats (hundreds place) and Blocks (thousands place).[1] There are also computer programs available that simulate base ten blocks.","image":"Dienes_blocks_used_by_a_8_year-old_student.png.webp","url":"Base_ten_block"}
