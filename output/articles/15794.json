{"title":"Time dependent vector field","summary":"In mathematics, a time dependent vector field is a construction in vector calculus which generalizes the concept of vector fields. It can be thought of as a vector field which moves as time passes. For every instant of time, it associates a vector to every point in a Euclidean space or in a manifold.","image":"3e344b4998e9aa2fc9dfde5e97571fcd1f684b54.svg","url":"Time_dependent_vector_field"}
