{"title":"Hilbert's third problem","summary":"The third of Hilbert's list of mathematical problems, presented in 1900, was the first to be solved. The problem is related to the following question: given any two polyhedra of equal volume, is it always possible to cut the first into finitely many polyhedral pieces which can be reassembled to yield the second? Based on earlier writings by Carl Friedrich Gauss,[1] David Hilbert conjectured that this is not always possible. This was confirmed within the year by his student Max Dehn, who proved that the answer in general is \"no\" by producing a counterexample.[2]","image":"Cube_and_prism_from_two_bricks.svg.png.webp","url":"Hilbert's_third_problem"}
