{"title":"Maximum inner-product search","summary":"Maximum inner-product search (MIPS) is a search problem, with a corresponding class of search algorithms which attempt to maximise the inner product between a query and the data items to be retrieved. MIPS algorithms are used in a wide variety of big data applications, including recommendation algorithms and machine learning.[1]","image":"e87000dd6142b81d041896a30fe58f0c3acb2158.svg","url":"Maximum_inner-product_search"}
