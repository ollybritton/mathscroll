{"title":"Knot invariant","summary":"In the mathematical field of knot theory, a knot invariant is a quantity (in a broad sense) defined for each knot which is the same for equivalent knots. The equivalence is often given by ambient isotopy but can be given by homeomorphism.[1] Some invariants are indeed numbers (algebraic[2]), but invariants can range from the simple, such as a yes/no answer, to those as complex as a homology theory (for example, \"a knot invariant is a rule that assigns to any knot K a quantity φ(K) such that if K and K' are equivalent then φ(K) = φ(K').\"[3]). Research on invariants is not only motivated by the basic problem of distinguishing one knot from another but also to understand fundamental properties of knots and their relations to other branches of mathematics. Knot invariants are thus used in knot classification,[3][4] both in \"enumeration\" and \"duplication removal\".[2]","image":"Knot_table.svg.png.webp","url":"Knot_invariant"}
