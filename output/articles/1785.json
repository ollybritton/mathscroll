{"title":"Bochner's theorem (Riemannian geometry)","summary":"In mathematics, Salomon Bochner proved in 1946 that any Killing vector field of a compact Riemannian manifold with negative Ricci curvature must be zero. Consequently the isometry group of the manifold must be finite.[1][2][3]","image":"2ab1faafde434a09d7f9f1089d1c7a9762a8d607.svg","url":"Bochner's_theorem_(Riemannian_geometry)"}
