{"title":"Cone (topology)","summary":"In topology, especially algebraic topology, the cone of a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} is intuitively obtained by stretching X into a cylinder and then collapsing one of its end faces to a point. The cone of X is denoted by C X {\\displaystyle CX} or by cone ‚Å° ( X ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {cone} (X)} .","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Cone_(topology)"}
