{"title":"Choice function","summary":"A choice function (selector, selection) is a mathematical function f  that is defined on some collection X of nonempty sets and assigns some element of each set S in that collection to S by f(S); f(S) maps S to some element of S. In other words, f is a choice function for X if and only if it belongs to the direct product of X.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Choice_function"}
