{"title":"Augmented dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the augmented dodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (J58), consisting of a dodecahedron with a pentagonal pyramid (J2) attached to one of the faces. When two or three such pyramids are attached, the result may be a parabiaugmented dodecahedron (J59), a metabiaugmented dodecahedron (J60), or a triaugmented dodecahedron (J61).","image":"Augmented_dodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Augmented_dodecahedron"}
