{"title":"Circular coloring","summary":"In graph theory, circular coloring is a kind of coloring that may be viewed as a refinement of the usual graph coloring. The circular chromatic number of a graph G {\\displaystyle G} , denoted Ï‡ c ( G ) {\\displaystyle \\chi _{c}(G)} can be given by any of the following definitions, all of which are equivalent (for finite graphs).","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Circular_coloring"}
