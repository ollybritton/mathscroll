{"title":"Mathesis universalis","summary":"Mathesis universalis (from Greek: μάθησις, mathesis \"science or learning\", and Latin: universalis \"universal\") is a hypothetical universal science modelled on mathematics envisaged by Descartes and Leibniz, among a number of other 16th- and 17th-century philosophers and mathematicians. For Leibniz, it would be supported by a calculus ratiocinator. John Wallis invokes the name as title in his Opera Mathematica, a textbook on arithmetic, algebra, and Cartesian geometry.","image":"lossless-page1-200px-Wallis_-_Opera_mathematica%2C_1657_-_4611280.tif.png.webp","url":"Mathesis_universalis"}
