{"title":"Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma","summary":"In axiomatic set theory, the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma (named after Helena Rasiowa and Roman Sikorski) is one of the most fundamental facts used in the technique of forcing. In the area of forcing, a subset E of a poset (P, ≤) is called dense in P if for any p ∈ P there is e ∈ E with e ≤ p. If D is a family of dense subsets of P, then a filter F in P is called D-generic if","image":"721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1.svg","url":"Rasiowa–Sikorski_lemma"}
