{"title":"Higher-order singular value decomposition","summary":"In multilinear algebra, the higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) of a tensor is a specific orthogonal Tucker decomposition. It may be regarded as one type of generalization of the matrix singular value decomposition. It has applications in computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, scientific computing, and signal processing. Some aspects can be traced as far back as F. L. Hitchcock in 1928,[1] but it was L. R. Tucker who developed for third-order tensors the general Tucker decomposition in the 1960s,[2][3][4] further advocated by L. De Lathauwer et al.[5] in their Multilinear SVD work that employs the power method, or advocated by Vasilescu and Terzopoulos that developed M-mode SVD a parallel algorithm that employs the matrix SVD.","image":"280ae03440942ab348c2ca9b8db6b56ffa9618f8.svg","url":"Higher-order_singular_value_decomposition"}
