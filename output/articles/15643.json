{"title":"The Banach–Tarski Paradox (book)","summary":"The Banach–Tarski Paradox is a book in mathematics on the Banach–Tarski paradox, the fact that a unit ball can be partitioned into a finite number of subsets and reassembled to form two unit balls. It was written by Stan Wagon and published in 1985 by the Cambridge University Press as volume 24 of their Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications book series.[1][2][3][4][5] A second printing in 1986 added two pages as an addendum, and a 1993 paperback printing added a new preface.[6] In 2016 the Cambridge University Press published a second edition, adding Grzegorz Tomkowicz as a co-author, as volume 163 of the same series.[7][8] The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has recommended its inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries.[8]","image":"The_Banach–Tarski_Paradox_(book).jpg.webp","url":"The_Banach–Tarski_Paradox_(book)"}
