{"title":"Class logic","summary":"Class logic is a logic in its broad sense, whose objects are called classes. In a narrower sense, one speaks of a class logic only if classes are described by a property of their elements. This class logic is thus a generalization of set theory, which allows only a limited consideration of classes.","image":"d11be99d44ff67310a30d2c39789505d8f5d5fd5.svg","url":"Class_logic"}
