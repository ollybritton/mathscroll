{"title":"Spectral sequence","summary":"In homological algebra and algebraic topology, a spectral sequence is a means of computing homology groups by taking successive approximations.  Spectral sequences are a generalization of exact sequences, and since their introduction by Jean LerayÂ (1946a, 1946b), they have become important computational tools, particularly in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and homological algebra.","image":"fb12fcfddb65e3d1e6a044215f6e833f0cd4337b.svg","url":"Spectral_sequence"}
