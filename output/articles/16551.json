{"title":"Vector spherical harmonics","summary":"In mathematics, vector spherical harmonics (VSH) are an extension of the scalar spherical harmonics for use with vector fields. The components of the VSH are complex-valued functions expressed in the spherical coordinate basis vectors.","image":"469ab35944f479339a8e94882f0e0bdc2f5bd49d.svg","url":"Vector_spherical_harmonics"}
