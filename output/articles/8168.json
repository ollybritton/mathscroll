{"title":"Jacobian conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the Jacobian conjecture is a famous unsolved problem concerning polynomials in several variables. It states that if a polynomial function from an n-dimensional space to itself has Jacobian determinant which is a non-zero constant, then the function has a polynomial inverse. It was first conjectured in 1939 by Ott-Heinrich Keller,[1] and widely publicized by Shreeram Abhyankar, as an example of a difficult question in algebraic geometry that can be understood using little beyond a knowledge of calculus.","image":"69e1fda7b33d3d25c8d2fa67c7f11052a9293bf3.svg","url":"Jacobian_conjecture"}
