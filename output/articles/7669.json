{"title":"Implementation of mathematics in set theory","summary":"This article examines the implementation of mathematical concepts in set theory. The implementation of a number of basic mathematical concepts is carried out in parallel in ZFC (the dominant set theory) and in NFU, the version of Quine's New Foundations shown to be consistent by R. B. Jensen in 1969 (here understood to include at least axioms of Infinity and Choice).","image":"72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4.svg","url":"Implementation_of_mathematics_in_set_theory"}
