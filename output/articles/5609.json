{"title":"Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing","summary":"Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing (FAST) is a variance-based global sensitivity analysis method. The sensitivity value is defined based on conditional variances which indicate the individual or joint effects of the uncertain inputs on the output.","image":"f5abe93c0cc023604ec3847c11e4ea6eb352745a.svg","url":"Fourier_amplitude_sensitivity_testing"}
