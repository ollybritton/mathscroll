{"title":"Lack-of-fit sum of squares","summary":"In statistics, a sum of squares due to lack of fit, or more tersely a lack-of-fit sum of squares, is one of the components of a partition of the sum of squares of residuals in an analysis of variance, used in the numerator in an F-test of the null hypothesis that says that a proposed model fits well. The other component is the pure-error sum of squares.","image":"cff453b1de7053587ddd97d35b72c074a110b397.svg","url":"Lack-of-fit_sum_of_squares"}
