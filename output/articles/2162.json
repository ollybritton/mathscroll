{"title":"Canonical Huffman code","summary":"In computer science and information theory, a canonical Huffman code is a particular type of Huffman code with unique properties which allow it to be described in a very compact manner. Rather than storing the structure of the code tree explicitly, canonical Huffman codes are ordered in such a way that it suffices to only store the lengths of the codewords, which reduces the overhead of the codebook.","image":"10cad61807a3b20f2e8979bc51ac217cb679d92a.svg","url":"Canonical_Huffman_code"}
