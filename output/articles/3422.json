{"title":"Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm","summary":"The Cooley–Tukey algorithm, named after J. W. Cooley and John Tukey, is the most common fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm.  It re-expresses the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of an arbitrary composite size N = N 1 N 2 {\\displaystyle N=N_{1}N_{2}} in terms of N1 smaller DFTs of sizes N2, recursively, to reduce the computation time to O(N log N) for highly composite N (smooth numbers). Because of the algorithm's importance, specific variants and implementation styles have become known by their own names, as described below.","image":"a0c0b639668a53a3e1aa021f95fe16e6886d2434.svg","url":"Cooley–Tukey_FFT_algorithm"}
