{"title":"Björling problem","summary":"In differential geometry, the Björling problem is the problem of finding a minimal surface passing through a given curve with prescribed normal (or tangent planes). The problem was posed and solved by Swedish mathematician Emanuel Gabriel Björling,[1] with further refinement by Hermann Schwarz.[2]","image":"Catalan's_Minimal_Surface.png.webp","url":"Björling_problem"}
