{"title":"Additively indecomposable ordinal","summary":"In set theory, a branch of mathematics, an additively indecomposable ordinal α is any ordinal number that is not 0 such that for any β , γ < α {\\displaystyle \\beta ,\\gamma <\\alpha } , we have β + γ < α . {\\displaystyle \\beta +\\gamma <\\alpha .} Additively indecomposable ordinals are also called gamma numbers or additive principal numbers.  The additively indecomposable ordinals are precisely those ordinals of the form ω β {\\displaystyle \\omega ^{\\beta }} for some ordinal β {\\displaystyle \\beta } .","image":"35db1e8d83333a56da8cdb665f2c26b59a58081e.svg","url":"Additively_indecomposable_ordinal"}
