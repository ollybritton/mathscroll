{"title":"Flow-equivalent server method","summary":"In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, the flow-equivalent server method (also known as flow-equivalent aggregation technique,[1] Norton's theorem for queueing networks or the Chandy–Herzog–Woo method[2]) is a divide-and-conquer method to solve product form queueing networks inspired by Norton's theorem for electrical circuits.[3] The network is successively split into two, one portion is reconfigured to a closed network and evaluated.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Flow-equivalent_server_method"}
