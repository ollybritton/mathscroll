{"title":"Krull's principal ideal theorem","summary":"In commutative algebra, Krull's principal ideal theorem, named after Wolfgang Krull (1899â€“1971),  gives a bound on the height of a principal ideal in a commutative Noetherian ring.  The theorem is sometimes referred to by its German name, Krulls Hauptidealsatz (Satz meaning \"proposition\" or \"theorem\").","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Krull's_principal_ideal_theorem"}
