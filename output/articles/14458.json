{"title":"Singularity theory","summary":"In mathematics, singularity theory studies spaces that are almost manifolds, but not quite. A string can serve as an example of a one-dimensional manifold, if one neglects its thickness. A singularity can be made by balling it up, dropping it on the floor, and flattening it. In some places the flat string will cross itself in an approximate \"X\" shape. The points on the floor where it does this are one kind of singularity, the double point: one bit of the floor corresponds to more than one bit of string. Perhaps the string will also touch itself without crossing, like an underlined \"U\". This is another kind of singularity. Unlike the double point, it is not stable, in the sense that a small push will lift the bottom of the \"U\" away from the \"underline\".","image":"Cubic_with_double_point.svg.png.webp","url":"Singularity_theory"}
