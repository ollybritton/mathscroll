{"title":"Legendre's constant","summary":"Legendre's constant is a mathematical constant occurring in a formula conjectured by Adrien-Marie Legendre to capture the asymptotic behavior of the prime-counting function π ( x ) {\\displaystyle \\pi (x)} . Its value is now known to be 1.","image":"5a62d9bf7b2ba03b30a95e7059362cc4b3865123.svg","url":"Legendre's_constant"}
