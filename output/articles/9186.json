{"title":"Lemniscate of Bernoulli","summary":"In geometry, the lemniscate of Bernoulli is a plane curve defined from two given points F1 and F2, known as foci, at distance 2c from each other as the locus of points P so that PF1·PF2 = c2. The curve has a shape similar to the numeral 8 and to the ∞ symbol. Its name is from lemniscatus, which is Latin for \"decorated with hanging ribbons\". It is a special case of the Cassini oval and is a rational algebraic curve of degree 4.","image":"Lemniskate_bernoulli2.svg.png.webp","url":"Lemniscate_of_Bernoulli"}
