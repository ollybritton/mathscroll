{"title":"Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence","summary":"In mathematics, the Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence is a spectral sequence for calculating generalized cohomology, introduced by Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch (1961) in the special case of topological K-theory. For a CW complex X {\\displaystyle X} and a generalized cohomology theory E ∙ {\\displaystyle E^{\\bullet }} , it relates the generalized cohomology groups","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Atiyah–Hirzebruch_spectral_sequence"}
