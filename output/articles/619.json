{"title":"Algebraically closed group","summary":"In group theory, a group A {\\displaystyle A\\ } is algebraically closed if any finite set of equations and inequations that are applicable to A {\\displaystyle A\\ } have a solution in A {\\displaystyle A\\ } without needing a group extension. This notion will be made precise later in the article in § Formal definition.","image":"3d7b748a827a7c1228bb9bf8df852ac3b9929096.svg","url":"Algebraically_closed_group"}
