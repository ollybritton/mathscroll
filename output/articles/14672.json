{"title":"Solèr's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Solèr's theorem is a result concerning certain infinite-dimensional vector spaces. It states that any orthomodular form that has an infinite orthonormal sequence is a Hilbert space over the real numbers, complex numbers or quaternions.[1][2] Originally proved by Maria Pia Solèr, the result is significant for quantum logic[3][4] and the foundations of quantum mechanics.[5][6] In particular, Solèr's theorem helps to fill a gap in the effort to use Gleason's theorem to rederive quantum mechanics from information-theoretic postulates.[7][8] It is also an important step in the Heunen-Kornell axiomatisation of the category of Hilbert spaces.[9]","image":"1848c435e64864e9ad4efa7e46bd6bc900c35c99.svg","url":"Solèr's_theorem"}
