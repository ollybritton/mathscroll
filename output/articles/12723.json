{"title":"Pseudomanifold","summary":"In mathematics, a pseudomanifold is a special type of topological space. It looks like a manifold at most of its points, but it may contain singularities. For example, the cone of solutions of z 2 = x 2 + y 2 {\\displaystyle z^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}} forms a pseudomanifold.","image":"4c62a8d16a3efdf08f47a8ba75f7f4b109183f18.svg","url":"Pseudomanifold"}
