{"title":"Pósa's theorem","summary":"Pósa's theorem, in graph theory, is a sufficient condition for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle based on the degrees of the vertices in an undirected graph. It implies two other degree-based sufficient conditions, Dirac's theorem on Hamiltonian cycles and Ore's theorem. Unlike those conditions, it can be applied to graphs with a small number of low-degree vertices. It is named after Lajos Pósa, a protégé of Paul Erdős born in 1947, who discovered this theorem in 1962.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Pósa's_theorem"}
