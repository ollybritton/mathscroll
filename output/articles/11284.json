{"title":"Numberphile","summary":"Numberphile is an educational YouTube channel featuring videos that explore topics from a variety of fields of mathematics.[2][3] In the early days of the channel, each video focused on a specific number, but the channel has since expanded its scope, featuring videos on more advanced mathematical concepts such as Fermat's Last Theorem, the Riemann hypothesis[4] and Kruskal's tree theorem.[5] The videos are produced by Brady Haran, a former BBC video journalist and creator of Periodic Videos, Sixty Symbols, and several other YouTube channels. Videos on the channel feature several university professors, maths communicators and famous mathematicians.[6]","image":"Numberphile_Logo.png.webp","url":"Numberphile"}
