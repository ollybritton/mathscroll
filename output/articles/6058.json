{"title":"Generalized Kac–Moody algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a generalized Kac–Moody algebra is a Lie algebra that is similar to a Kac–Moody algebra, except that it is allowed to have imaginary simple roots. Generalized Kac–Moody algebras are also sometimes called GKM algebras, Borcherds–Kac–Moody algebras, BKM algebras, or Borcherds algebras. The best known example is the monster Lie algebra.","image":"2a106b8753c0948250bbc2e03df3207799beaedb.svg","url":"Generalized_Kac–Moody_algebra"}
