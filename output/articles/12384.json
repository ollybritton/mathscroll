{"title":"Population pyramid","summary":"A population pyramid (age structure diagram) or \"age-sex pyramid\" is a graphical illustration of the distribution of a population (typically that of a country or region of the world) by age groups and sex; it typically takes the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing.[1] Males are usually shown on the left and females on the right, and they may be measured in absolute numbers or as a percentage of the total population. The pyramid can be used to visualize the age of a particular population.[2] It is also used in ecology to determine the overall age distribution of a population; an indication of the reproductive capabilities and likelihood of the continuation of a species. Number of people per unit area of land is called population density.","image":"Angola_population_pyramid_2005.svg.png.webp","url":"Population_pyramid"}
