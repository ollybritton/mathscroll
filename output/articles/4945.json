{"title":"Erdős–Bacon number","summary":"A person's Erdős–Bacon number is the sum of one's Erdős number—which measures the \"collaborative distance\" in authoring academic papers between that person and Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős—and one's Bacon number—which represents the number of links, through roles in films, by which the person is separated from American actor Kevin Bacon.[1][2] The lower the number, the closer a person is to Erdős and Bacon, which reflects a small world phenomenon in academia and entertainment.[3]","image":"a807ab4cb3de13a66771b5a303aca31e0391e6aa.svg","url":"Erdős–Bacon_number"}
