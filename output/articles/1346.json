{"title":"Barycentric subdivision","summary":"In mathematics, the barycentric subdivision is a standard way to subdivide a given simplex into smaller ones. Its extension on simplicial complexes is a canonical method to refine them. Therefore, the barycentric subdivision is an important tool in algebraic topology.","image":"Barycentric_subdivision.svg.png.webp","url":"Barycentric_subdivision"}
