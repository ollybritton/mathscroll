{"title":"Universal quantification","summary":"In mathematical logic, a universal quantification is a type of quantifier, a logical constant which is interpreted as \"given any\", \"for all\", or \"for any\". It expresses that a predicate can be satisfied by every member of a domain of discourse. In other words, it is the predication of a property or relation to every member of the domain. It asserts that a predicate within the scope of a universal quantifier is true of every value of a predicate variable.","image":"25873948fc98344950ea1b91f88dd52239cf9c87.svg","url":"Universal_quantification"}
