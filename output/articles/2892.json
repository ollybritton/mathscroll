{"title":"Combinatorial explosion","summary":"In mathematics, a combinatorial explosion is the rapid growth of the complexity of a problem due to how the combinatorics of the problem is affected by the input, constraints, and bounds of the problem. Combinatorial explosion is sometimes used to justify the intractability of certain problems.[1][2] Examples of such problems include certain mathematical functions, the analysis of some puzzles and games, and some pathological examples which can be modelled as the Ackermann function.","image":"624c2a35a984acc2c0726fe54b95dc84bf8c60be.svg","url":"Combinatorial_explosion"}
