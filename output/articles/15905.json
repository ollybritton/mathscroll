{"title":"Total absolute curvature","summary":"In differential geometry, the total absolute curvature of a smooth curve is a number defined by integrating the absolute value of the curvature around the curve. It is a dimensionless quantity that is invariant under similarity transformations of the curve, and that can be used to measure how far the curve is from being a convex curve.[1]","image":"dfbaba954aafb2827863f2002065174d7d566495.svg","url":"Total_absolute_curvature"}
