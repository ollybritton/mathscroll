{"title":"Circulation problem","summary":"The circulation problem and its variants are a generalisation of network flow problems, with the added constraint of a lower bound on edge flows, and with flow conservation also being required for the source and sink (i.e. there are no special nodes). In variants of the problem, there are multiple commodities flowing through the network, and a cost on the flow.","image":"7dc43221ee885a10b87c89373b12b8c1110e7ca5.svg","url":"Circulation_problem"}
