{"title":"Eigendecomposition of a matrix","summary":"In linear algebra, eigendecomposition is the factorization of a matrix into a canonical form, whereby the matrix is represented in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Only diagonalizable matrices can be factorized in this way. When the matrix being factorized is a normal or real symmetric matrix, the decomposition is called \"spectral decomposition\", derived from the spectral theorem.","image":"eb4bca75ce898b48e51ff4f79b0a8cc3c53afdee.svg","url":"Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix"}
