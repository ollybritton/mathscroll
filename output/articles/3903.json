{"title":"Degree of a polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, the degree of a polynomial is the highest of the degrees of the polynomial's monomials (individual terms) with non-zero coefficients. The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of the variables that appear in it, and thus is a non-negative integer. For a univariate polynomial, the degree of the polynomial is simply the highest exponent occurring in the polynomial.[1] The term order has been used as a synonym of degree but, nowadays, may refer to several other concepts (see order of a polynomial (disambiguation)).","image":"b8f42a2b9071df7756f985ce7dea5016ae31c7df.svg","url":"Degree_of_a_polynomial"}
