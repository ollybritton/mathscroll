{"title":"Localization (commutative algebra)","summary":"In commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, localization is a formal way to introduce the \"denominators\" to a given ring or module. That is, it introduces a new ring/module out of an existing ring/module R, so that it consists of fractions m s , {\\displaystyle {\\frac {m}{s}},} such that the denominator s belongs to a given subset S of R. If S is the set of the non-zero elements of an integral domain, then the localization is the field of fractions: this case generalizes the construction of the field Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } of rational numbers from the ring Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} } of integers.","image":"b50cf47f75892dda1b00c35505f9e20e3201d80b.svg","url":"Localization_(commutative_algebra)"}
