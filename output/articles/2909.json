{"title":"Common integrals in quantum field theory","summary":"Common integrals in quantum field theory are all variations and generalizations of Gaussian integrals to the complex plane and to multiple dimensions.[1] Other integrals can be approximated by versions of the Gaussian integral. Fourier integrals are also considered.","image":"f135cd95d0ce0ff3d79044b1c7e9e42b9cd4f675.svg","url":"Common_integrals_in_quantum_field_theory"}
