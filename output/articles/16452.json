{"title":"Untouchable number","summary":"An untouchable number is a positive integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of all the proper divisors of any positive integer (including the untouchable number itself). That is, these numbers are not in the image of the aliquot sum function. Their study goes back at least to Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi (circa 1000 AD), who observed that both 2 and 5 are untouchable.[1]","image":"ddeb2608add28237e1ba6f7d02100e10fcad8204.svg","url":"Untouchable_number"}
