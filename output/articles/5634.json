{"title":"Fractal landscape","summary":"A fractal landscape or fractal surface is generated using a stochastic algorithm designed to produce fractal behavior that mimics the appearance of natural terrain. In other words, the surface resulting from the procedure is not a deterministic, but rather a random surface that exhibits fractal behavior.[1]","image":"Animated_fractal_mountain.gif","url":"Fractal_landscape"}
