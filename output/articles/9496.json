{"title":"List of irreducible Tits indices","summary":"In the mathematical theory of linear algebraic groups, a Tits index (or index) is an object used to classify semisimple algebraic groups defined over a base field k, not assumed to be algebraically closed. The possible irreducible indices were classified by Jacques Tits,[1] and this classification is reproduced below. (Because every index is a direct sum of irreducible indices, classifying all indices amounts to classifying irreducible indices.)","image":"Tits_index_1An.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_irreducible_Tits_indices"}
