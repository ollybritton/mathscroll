{"title":"Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics","summary":"The Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics, also called the Satter Prize, is one of twenty-one prizes given out by the American Mathematical Society (AMS).[1] It is presented biennially in recognition of an outstanding contribution to mathematics research by a woman in the previous six years.[2] The award was established in 1990 using a donation from Joan Birman, in memory of her sister, Ruth Lyttle Satter,[3] who worked primarily in biological sciences, and was a proponent for equal opportunities for women in science.[4] First awarded in 1991, the award is intended to \"honor [Satter's] commitment to research and to encourage women in science\".[5]  The winner is selected by the council of the AMS, based on the recommendation of a selection committee.[5] The prize is awarded at the Joint Mathematics Meetings during odd numbered years, and has always carried a modest cash reward. Since 2003, the prize has been $5,000,[5][6] while from 1997 to 2001, the prize came with $1,200,[7][8] and prior to that it was $4,000.[9] If a joint award is made, the prize money is split between the recipients.[7]","image":"Dusa_McDuff.jpg.webp","url":"Ruth_Lyttle_Satter_Prize_in_Mathematics"}
