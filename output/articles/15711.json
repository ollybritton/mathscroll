{"title":"Think-a-Dot","summary":"The Think-a-Dot was a mathematical toy invented by Joseph Weisbecker[1] and manufactured by E.S.R., Inc. during the 1960s that demonstrated automata theory. It had eight coloured disks on its front, and three holes on its top – left, right, and center – through which a ball bearing could be dropped. Each disk would display either a yellow or blue face, depending on whether the mechanism behind it was tipped to the right or the left. The Think-a-Dot thus had 28=256 internal states. When the ball fell to the bottom it would exit either to a hole on the left or the right of the device.","image":"Think_a_dot_mechanism.svg.png.webp","url":"Think-a-Dot"}
