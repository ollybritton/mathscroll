In operator theory, he is best known for his work in the 1980s on the invariant subspace problem, where he constructed operators with only trivial invariant subspaces on particular Banach spaces, especially on ℓ 1 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{1}} .[1][2] He won the 1985 Junior Berwick Prize for his work on the invariant subspace problem.[3]","image":"361ddd720474aa41cb05453e03424fb7999d3b02.svg","url":"Charles_Read_(mathematician)"}
