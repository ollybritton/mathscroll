{"title":"Lebesgue differentiation theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Lebesgue differentiation theorem is a theorem of real analysis, which states that for almost every point, the value of an integrable function is the limit of infinitesimal averages taken about the point. The theorem is named for Henri Lebesgue.","image":"3e1e36d7dd8095edc4548550f7e66273270f3e1b.svg","url":"Lebesgue_differentiation_theorem"}
