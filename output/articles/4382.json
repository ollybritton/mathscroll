{"title":"Dold manifold","summary":"In mathematics, a Dold manifold is one of the manifolds P ( m , n ) = ( S m × C P n ) / τ {\\displaystyle P(m,n)=(S^{m}\\times \\mathbb {CP} ^{n})/\\tau } , where τ {\\displaystyle \\tau } is the involution that acts as −1 on the m-sphere S m {\\displaystyle S^{m}} and as complex conjugation on the complex projective space C P n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {CP} ^{n}} . These manifolds were constructed by Albrecht Dold (1956), who used them to give explicit generators for René Thom's unoriented cobordism ring.[1] Note that P ( m , 0 ) = R P m {\\displaystyle P(m,0)=\\mathbb {RP} ^{m}} , the real projective space of dimension m, and P ( 0 , n ) = C P n {\\displaystyle P(0,n)=\\mathbb {CP} ^{n}} .[2]","image":"55b4b11af4dd74871a5ba24d809c12359ec6f491.svg","url":"Dold_manifold"}
