{"title":"Generalized Verma module","summary":"In mathematics, generalized Verma modules are a generalization of a (true) Verma module,[1] and are objects in the representation theory of Lie algebras. They were studied originally by James Lepowsky in the 1970s. The motivation for their study is that their homomorphisms correspond to invariant differential operators over generalized flag manifolds. The study of these operators is an important part of the theory of parabolic geometries.","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Generalized_Verma_module"}
