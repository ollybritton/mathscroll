{"title":"Triangle-free graph","summary":"In the mathematical area of graph theory, a triangle-free graph is an undirected graph in which no three vertices form a triangle of edges. Triangle-free graphs may be equivalently defined as graphs with clique number ≤ 2, graphs with girth ≥ 4, graphs with no induced 3-cycle, or locally independent graphs.","image":"Biclique_K_5_5.svg.png.webp","url":"Triangle-free_graph"}
