{"title":"Bass number","summary":"In mathematics, the ith Bass number of a module M over a local ring R with residue field k is the k-dimension of Ext R i ⁡ ( k , M ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Ext} _{R}^{i}(k,M)} . More generally the Bass number μ i ( p , M ) {\\displaystyle \\mu _{i}(p,M)} of a module M over a ring R at a prime ideal p is the Bass number of the localization of M for the localization of R (with respect to the prime p). Bass numbers were introduced by Hyman Bass (1963, p.11).","image":"cb12062b4d7c3fd72d836d0cae79f85276efc5f6.svg","url":"Bass_number"}
