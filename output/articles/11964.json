{"title":"Pentagonal orthocupolarotunda","summary":"In geometry, the pentagonal orthocupolarotunda is one of the Johnson solids  (J32).  As the name suggests, it can be constructed by joining a pentagonal cupola (J5) and a pentagonal rotunda (J6) along their decagonal bases, matching the pentagonal faces. A 36-degree rotation of one of the halves before the joining yields a pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda (J33).","image":"Pentagonal_orthocupolarotunda.png.webp","url":"Pentagonal_orthocupolarotunda"}
