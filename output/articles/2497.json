{"title":"Characteristic subgroup","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in the area of abstract algebra known as group theory, a characteristic subgroup is a subgroup that is mapped to itself by every automorphism of the parent group.[1][2]  Because every conjugation map is an inner automorphism, every characteristic subgroup is normal; though the converse is not guaranteed.  Examples of characteristic subgroups include the commutator subgroup and the center of a group.","image":"31bf60996247da1560c23a228166bff89ba97783.svg","url":"Characteristic_subgroup"}
