{"title":"Semisimple representation","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in representation theory, a semisimple representation (also called a completely reducible representation) is a linear representation of a group or an algebra that is a direct sum of simple representations (also called irreducible representations).[1] It is an example of the general mathematical notion of semisimplicity.","image":"c95f5b8b7e4a65dd0d1b456c66fac5c624b72a82.svg","url":"Semisimple_representation"}
