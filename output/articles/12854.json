{"title":"Quantum Turing machine","summary":"A quantum Turing machine (QTM) or universal quantum computer is an abstract machine used to model the effects of a quantum computer.  It provides a simple model that captures all of the power of quantum computation—that is, any quantum algorithm can be expressed formally as a particular quantum Turing machine. However, the computationally equivalent quantum circuit is a more common model.[1][2]: 2","image":"8734c2a9963bd7ee2ba7f71509043fe479f79ec6.svg","url":"Quantum_Turing_machine"}
