{"title":"Cylindrical multipole moments","summary":"Cylindrical multipole moments are the coefficients in a series expansion of a potential that varies logarithmically with the distance to a source, i.e., as ln ‚Å° R {\\displaystyle \\ln \\ R} . Such potentials arise in the electric potential of long line charges, and the analogous sources for the magnetic potential and gravitational potential.","image":"d829a66f1f474aaf146d9122cf03222cb8592dd0.svg","url":"Cylindrical_multipole_moments"}
