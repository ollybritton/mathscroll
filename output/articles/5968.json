{"title":"Gateaux derivative","summary":"In mathematics, the Gateaux differential or Gateaux derivative is a generalization of the concept of directional derivative in differential calculus. Named after René Gateaux, a French mathematician who died young in World War I, it is defined for functions between locally convex topological vector spaces such as Banach spaces.  Like the Fréchet derivative on a Banach space, the Gateaux differential is often used to formalize the functional derivative commonly used in the calculus of variations and physics.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Gateaux_derivative"}
