{"title":"PA degree","summary":"In the mathematical field of computability theory, a PA degree is a Turing degree that computes a complete extension of Peano arithmetic (Jockusch 1987). These degrees are closely related to fixed-point-free (DNR) functions, and have been thoroughly investigated in recursion theory.","image":"707f07db8f3ec363463ae671d945e6c2fc7a520d.svg","url":"PA_degree"}
