{"title":"John Venn","summary":"John Venn, FRS,[2][3] FSA[4] (4 August 1834 â€“ 4 April 1923) was an English mathematician, logician and philosopher noted for introducing Venn diagrams, which are used in logic, set theory, probability, statistics, and computer science. In 1866, Venn published The Logic of Chance, a groundbreaking book which espoused the frequency theory of probability, arguing that probability should be determined by how often something is forecast to occur as opposed to \"educated\" assumptions. Venn then further developed George Boole's theories in the 1881 work Symbolic Logic, where he highlighted what would become known as Venn diagrams.","image":"John_Venn_2.jpg.webp","url":"John_Venn"}
