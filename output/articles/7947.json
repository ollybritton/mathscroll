{"title":"Interval (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a (real) interval is a set of real numbers that contains all real numbers lying between any two numbers of the set. For example, the set of numbers x satisfying 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 is an interval which contains 0, 1, and all numbers in between. Other examples of intervals are the set of numbers such that 0 < x < 1, the set of all real numbers R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } , the set of nonnegative real numbers, the set of positive real numbers, the empty set, and any singleton (set of one element).","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Interval_(mathematics)"}
