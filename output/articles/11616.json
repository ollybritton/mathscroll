{"title":"Oscillatory integral","summary":"In mathematical analysis an oscillatory integral is a type of distribution. Oscillatory integrals make rigorous many arguments that, on a naive level, appear to use divergent integrals. It is possible to represent approximate solution operators for many differential equations as oscillatory integrals.","image":"202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074.svg","url":"Oscillatory_integral"}
