{"title":"Algebraically compact module","summary":"In mathematics, algebraically compact modules, also called pure-injective modules, are modules that have a certain \"nice\" property which allows the solution of infinite systems of equations in the module by finitary means.  The solutions to these systems allow the extension of certain kinds of module homomorphisms.  These algebraically compact modules are analogous to injective modules, where one can extend all module homomorphisms.  All injective modules are algebraically compact, and the analogy between the two is made quite precise by a category embedding.","image":"d8b6a14cb6aac98443625aca24920ac93f10b37e.svg","url":"Algebraically_compact_module"}
