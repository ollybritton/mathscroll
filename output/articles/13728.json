{"title":"Rotational symmetry","summary":"Rotational symmetry, also known as radial symmetry in geometry, is the property a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn. An object's degree of rotational symmetry is the number of distinct orientations in which it looks exactly the same for each rotation.","image":"The_armoured_triskelion_on_the_flag_of_the_Isle_of_Man.svg.png.webp","url":"Rotational_symmetry"}
