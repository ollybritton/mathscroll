{"title":"Frobenius solution to the hypergeometric equation","summary":"In the following we solve the second-order differential equation called the hypergeometric differential equation using Frobenius method, named after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius. This is a method that uses the series solution for a differential equation, where we assume the solution takes the form of a series. This is usually the method we use for complicated ordinary differential equations.","image":"61c7b3f22d2bb3eec6eaf94cf06fce737e21e46a.svg","url":"Frobenius_solution_to_the_hypergeometric_equation"}
