{"title":"Set (mathematics)","summary":"A set is the mathematical model for a collection of different[1] things;[2][3][4] a set contains elements or members, which can be mathematical objects of any kind: numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, or even other sets.[5]  The set with no element is the empty set; a set with a single element is a singleton.  A set may have a finite number of elements or be an infinite set.  Two sets are equal if they have precisely the same elements.[6]","image":"Example_of_a_set.svg.png.webp","url":"Set_(mathematics)"}
