{"title":"Lie theory","summary":"In mathematics, the mathematician Sophus Lie (/liː/ LEE) initiated lines of study involving integration of differential equations, transformation groups, and contact of spheres that have come to be called Lie theory.[1]  For instance, the latter subject is Lie sphere geometry. This article addresses his approach to transformation groups, which is one of the areas of mathematics, and was worked out by Wilhelm Killing and Élie Cartan.","image":"1a1a3221122ade6a37cf24d82fbd683d3b50e371.svg","url":"Lie_theory"}
