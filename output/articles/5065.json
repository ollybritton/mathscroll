{"title":"Euler's theorem","summary":"In number theory, Euler's theorem (also known as the Fermat–Euler theorem or Euler's totient theorem) states that, if n and a are coprime positive integers, and φ ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\varphi (n)} is Euler's totient function, then a raised to the power φ ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\varphi (n)} is congruent to 1 modulo n; that is","image":"f067864064667dd5f8b2508b9cbf983d89788629.svg","url":"Euler's_theorem"}
