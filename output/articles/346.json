{"title":"Acylindrically hyperbolic group","summary":"In the mathematical subject of geometric group theory, an acylindrically hyperbolic group is a group admitting a non-elementary 'acylindrical' isometric action on some geodesic hyperbolic metric space.[1] This notion generalizes the notions of a hyperbolic group and of a relatively hyperbolic group and includes a significantly wider class of examples, such as mapping class groups and Out(Fn).","image":"56c27fc5e613e042a8189e48f4b5edec9acda98b.svg","url":"Acylindrically_hyperbolic_group"}
