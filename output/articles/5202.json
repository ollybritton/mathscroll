{"title":"Extended real number line","summary":"In mathematics, the affinely extended real number system is obtained from the real number system R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } by adding two infinity elements: + ∞ {\\displaystyle +\\infty } and − ∞ , {\\displaystyle -\\infty ,} [lower-alpha 1] where the infinities are treated as actual numbers. It is useful in describing the algebra on infinities and the various limiting behaviors in calculus and mathematical analysis, especially in the theory of measure and integration.[1] The affinely extended real number system is denoted R ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\overline {\\mathbb {R} }}} or [ − ∞ , + ∞ ] {\\displaystyle [-\\infty ,+\\infty ]} or R ∪ { − ∞ , + ∞ } . {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} \\cup \\left\\{-\\infty ,+\\infty \\right\\}.} [2] It is the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of the real numbers.","image":"786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc.svg","url":"Extended_real_number_line"}
