{"title":"Brachistochrone curve","summary":"In physics and mathematics, a brachistochrone curve (from Ancient Greek  βράχιστος χρόνος (brákhistos khrónos) 'shortest time'),[1] or curve of fastest descent, is the one lying on the plane between a point A and a lower point B, where B is not directly below A, on which a bead slides frictionlessly under the influence of a uniform gravitational field to a given end point in the shortest time. The problem was posed by Johann Bernoulli in 1696.","image":"Brachistochrone.gif","url":"Brachistochrone_curve"}
