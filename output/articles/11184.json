{"title":"Nonlinear partial differential equation","summary":"In mathematics and physics, a nonlinear partial differential equation is a partial differential equation with nonlinear terms. They describe many different physical systems, ranging from gravitation to fluid dynamics, and have been used in mathematics to solve problems such as the Poincar√© conjecture and the Calabi conjecture. They are difficult to study: almost no general techniques exist that work for all such equations, and usually each individual equation has to be studied as a separate problem.","image":"9ddbaf7c5a0582aa0bfb4efc656cf49a487971d6.svg","url":"Nonlinear_partial_differential_equation"}
