{"title":"Function composition","summary":"In mathematics, function composition is an operation  ∘  that takes two functions f and g, and produces a function h = g  ∘  f such that h(x) = g(f(x)). In this operation, the function g is applied to the result of applying the function f to x. That is, the functions f : X → Y and g : Y → Z are composed to yield a function that maps x in domain X to g(f(x)) in codomain Z. Intuitively, if z is a function of y, and y is a function of x, then z is a function of x. The resulting composite function is denoted g ∘ f : X → Z, defined by (g ∘ f )(x) = g(f(x)) for all x in X.[nb 1]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Function_composition"}
