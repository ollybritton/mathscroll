{"title":"Dickson's lemma","summary":"In mathematics, Dickson's lemma states that every set of n {\\displaystyle n} -tuples of natural numbers has finitely many minimal elements. This simple fact from combinatorics has become attributed to the American algebraist L. E. Dickson, who used it to prove a result in number theory about perfect numbers.[1] However, the lemma was certainly known earlier, for example to Paul Gordan in his research on invariant theory.[2]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Dickson's_lemma"}
