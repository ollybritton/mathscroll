{"title":"Algebraic space","summary":"In mathematics, algebraic spaces form a generalization of the schemes of algebraic geometry, introduced by Michael Artin[1] for use in deformation theory. Intuitively, schemes are given by gluing together affine schemes using the Zariski topology, while algebraic spaces are given by gluing together affine schemes using the finer étale topology. Alternatively one can think of schemes as being locally isomorphic to affine schemes in the Zariski topology, while algebraic spaces are locally isomorphic to affine schemes in the étale topology.","image":"76538f5ee5794b87f3a462196ea9cb167d1c1ab0.svg","url":"Algebraic_space"}
