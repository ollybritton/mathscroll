{"title":"Mathematics of paper folding","summary":"The discipline of origami or paper folding has received a considerable amount of mathematical study. Fields of interest include a given paper model's flat-foldability (whether the model can be flattened without damaging it), and the use of paper folds to solve up-to cubic mathematical equations.[1]","image":"MapFoldings-2x2.png.webp","url":"Mathematics_of_paper_folding"}
