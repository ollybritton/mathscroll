{"title":"Shimizu L-function","summary":"In mathematics, the Shimizu L-function, introduced by Hideo Shimizu (1963), is a Dirichlet series associated to a totally real algebraic number field. Michael Francis Atiyah, H. Donnelly, and I. M. Singer (1983) defined the signature defect of the boundary of a manifold as the eta invariant, the value as s=0 of their eta function, and used this to show that Hirzebruch's signature defect of a cusp of a Hilbert modular surface can be expressed in terms of the value at s=0 or 1 of a Shimizu L-function.","image":"283fc3f0424fb7726b643695edf1b35bc4eae8ba.svg","url":"Shimizu_L-function"}
