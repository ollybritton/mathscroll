{"title":"Flexible polyhedron","summary":"In geometry, a flexible polyhedron is a polyhedral surface without any boundary edges, whose shape can be continuously changed while keeping the shapes of all of its faces unchanged.  The Cauchy rigidity theorem shows that in dimensionÂ 3 such a polyhedron cannot be convex (this is also true in higher dimensions).","image":"Ste-anim.gif","url":"Flexible_polyhedron"}
