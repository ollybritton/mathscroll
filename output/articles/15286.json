{"title":"Supersingular prime (algebraic number theory)","summary":"In algebraic number theory, a supersingular prime for a given elliptic curve is a prime number with a certain relationship to that curve.  If the curve E is defined over the rational numbers, then a prime p is supersingular for E if the reduction of E modulo p is a supersingular elliptic curve over the residue field Fp.","image":"66653f56d58e07c854d2ace3afc01bd58c5d0278.svg","url":"Supersingular_prime_(algebraic_number_theory)"}
