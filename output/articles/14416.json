{"title":"Simplicial map","summary":"A simplicial map (also called simplicial mapping) is a function between two simplicial complexes, with the property that the images of the vertices of a simplex always span a simplex.[1] Simplicial maps can be used to approximate continuous functions between topological spaces that can be triangulated; this is formalized by the simplicial approximation theorem.","image":"22dd6db11c841021484f4792083f7fa223d0931f.svg","url":"Simplicial_map"}
