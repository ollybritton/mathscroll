{"title":"Goursat tetrahedron","summary":"In geometry, a Goursat tetrahedron is a tetrahedral fundamental domain of a Wythoff construction. Each tetrahedral face represents a reflection hyperplane on 3-dimensional surfaces: the 3-sphere, Euclidean 3-space, and hyperbolic 3-space. Coxeter named them after Ã‰douard Goursat who first looked into these domains. It is an extension of the theory of Schwarz triangles for Wythoff constructions on the sphere.","image":"Coxeter-Dynkin_3-space_groups.png.webp","url":"Goursat_tetrahedron"}
