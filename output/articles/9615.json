{"title":"Local ring","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in ring theory, local rings are certain rings that are comparatively simple, and serve to describe what is called \"local behaviour\", in the sense of functions defined on varieties or manifolds, or of algebraic number fields examined at a particular place, or prime. Local algebra is the branch of commutative algebra that studies commutative local rings and their modules.","image":"3f568eec3d80f812c3d02a19a445f088e888c180.svg","url":"Local_ring"}
