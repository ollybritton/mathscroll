{"title":"Homomorphic equivalence","summary":"In the mathematics of graph theory, two graphs, G and H, are called homomorphically equivalent if there exists a graph homomorphism f : G → H {\\displaystyle f\\colon G\\to H} and a graph homomorphism g : H → G {\\displaystyle g\\colon H\\to G} . An example usage of this notion is that any two cores of a graph are homomorphically equivalent.","image":"4b01cffaf0bcf24966e7d64f7f1ecc5fd7fdc511.svg","url":"Homomorphic_equivalence"}
