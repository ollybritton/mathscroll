{"title":"Quarter order-6 square tiling","summary":"In geometry, the quarter order-6 square tiling is a uniform tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It has Schl√§fli symbol of q{4,6}. It is constructed from *3232 orbifold notation, and can be seen as a half symmetry of *443 and *662, and quarter symmetry of *642.","image":"Uniform_tiling_verf_34664.png.webp","url":"Quarter_order-6_square_tiling"}
