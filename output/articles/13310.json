{"title":"Regular extension","summary":"In field theory, a branch of algebra, a field extension L / k {\\displaystyle L/k} is said to be regular if k is algebraically closed in L  (i.e., k = k ^ {\\displaystyle k={\\hat {k}}} where k ^ {\\displaystyle {\\hat {k}}} is the set of elements in L algebraic over k) and L is separable over k, or equivalently, L ⊗ k k ¯ {\\displaystyle L\\otimes _{k}{\\overline {k}}} is an integral domain when k ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\overline {k}}} is the algebraic closure of k {\\displaystyle k} (that is, to say, L , k ¯ {\\displaystyle L,{\\overline {k}}} are linearly disjoint over k).[1][2]","image":"a72da98413add71c5cdc18c528ee949d94a12ea8.svg","url":"Regular_extension"}
