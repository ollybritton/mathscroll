{"title":"MacRobert E function","summary":"In mathematics, the E-function was introduced by Thomas Murray MacRobert (1937–1938)  to extend the generalized hypergeometric series pFq(·) to the case p > q + 1. The underlying objective was to define a very general function that includes as particular cases the majority of the special functions known until then. However, this function had no great impact on the literature as it can always be expressed in terms of the Meijer G-function, while the opposite is not true, so that the G-function is of a still more general nature. It is defined as:","image":"b61abf1a4245b55eb979ef3e053f5735a0f87f72.svg","url":"MacRobert_E_function"}
