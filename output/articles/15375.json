{"title":"Symmetric monoidal category","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a symmetric monoidal category is a monoidal category (i.e. a category in which a \"tensor product\" ⊗ {\\displaystyle \\otimes } is defined) such that the tensor product is symmetric (i.e. A ⊗ B {\\displaystyle A\\otimes B} is, in a certain strict sense, naturally isomorphic to B ⊗ A {\\displaystyle B\\otimes A} for all objects A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} of the category). One of the prototypical examples of a symmetric monoidal category is the category of vector spaces over some fixed field k, using the ordinary tensor product of vector spaces.","image":"de29098f5a34ee296a505681a0d5e875070f2aea.svg","url":"Symmetric_monoidal_category"}
