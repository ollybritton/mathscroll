{"title":"Bicategory","summary":"In mathematics, a bicategory (or a weak 2-category) is a concept in category theory used to extend the notion of category to handle the cases where the composition of morphisms is not (strictly) associative, but only associative up to an isomorphism. The notion was introduced in 1967 by Jean BÃ©nabou.","image":"c4cfcbb6456e0c83557b51df3320b93d71effb65.svg","url":"Bicategory"}
