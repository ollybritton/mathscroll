{"title":"Conjugate prior","summary":"In Bayesian probability theory, if the posterior distribution p ( θ ∣ x ) {\\displaystyle p(\\theta \\mid x)} is in the same probability distribution family as the prior probability distribution p ( θ ) {\\displaystyle p(\\theta )} , the prior and posterior are then called conjugate distributions, and the prior is called a conjugate prior for the likelihood function p ( x ∣ θ ) {\\displaystyle p(x\\mid \\theta )} .","image":"2098b0995e061061a281b87b80830e534b917656.svg","url":"Conjugate_prior"}
