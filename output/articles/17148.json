{"title":"Zero-sum problem","summary":"In number theory, zero-sum problems are certain kinds of combinatorial problems about the structure of a finite abelian group.  Concretely, given a finite abelian group G and a positive integer n, one asks for the smallest value of k such that every sequence of elements of G of size k contains n terms that sum to 0.","image":"f2120ebbc85f91df66c6de5446367bf9fd620844.svg","url":"Zero-sum_problem"}
