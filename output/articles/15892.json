{"title":"Torsion (algebra)","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in ring theory, a torsion element is an element of a module that yields zero when multiplied by some non-zero-divisor of the ring. The torsion submodule of a module is the submodule formed by the torsion elements. A torsion module is a module that equals its torsion submodule. A module is torsion-free if its torsion submodule comprises only the zero element.","image":"82d85120198128545fbda1a7376e0239537be94f.svg","url":"Torsion_(algebra)"}
