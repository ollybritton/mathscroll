{"title":"Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm","summary":"In mathematics and computing, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA or just LM), also known as the  damped least-squares (DLS) method, is used to solve non-linear least squares problems.  These minimization problems arise especially in least squares curve fitting.  The LMA interpolates between the Gauss–Newton algorithm (GNA) and the method of gradient descent. The LMA is more robust than the GNA, which means that in many cases it finds a solution even if it starts very far off the final minimum. For well-behaved functions and reasonable starting parameters, the LMA tends to be slower than the GNA. LMA can also be viewed as Gauss–Newton using a trust region approach.","image":"0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc.svg","url":"Levenberg–Marquardt_algorithm"}
