{"title":"Regulated function","summary":"In mathematics, a regulated function, or ruled function, is a certain kind of well-behaved function of a single real variable. Regulated functions arise as a class of integrable functions, and have several equivalent characterisations.  Regulated functions were introduced by Nicolas Bourbaki in 1949, in their book \"Livre IV: Fonctions d'une variable r√©elle\".","image":"dbff35e3cacd1d799a37f5807be1661ba84fd7e0.svg","url":"Regulated_function"}
