{"title":"Mathematical visualization","summary":"Mathematical phenomena can be understood and explored via visualization. Classically this consisted of two-dimensional drawings or building three-dimensional models (particularly plaster models in the 19th and early 20th century), while today it most frequently consists of using computers to make static two or three dimensional drawings, animations, or interactive programs. Writing programs to visualize mathematics is an aspect of computational geometry.","image":"Mandel_zoom_00_mandelbrot_set.jpg.webp","url":"Mathematical_visualization"}
