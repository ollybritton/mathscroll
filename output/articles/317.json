{"title":"Accelerated failure time model","summary":"In the statistical area of survival analysis, an accelerated failure time model  (AFT model) is a parametric model that provides an alternative to the commonly used proportional hazards models. Whereas a proportional hazards model assumes that the effect of a covariate is to multiply the hazard by some constant, an AFT model assumes that the effect of a covariate is to accelerate or decelerate the life course of a disease by some constant. This is especially appealing in a technical context where the 'disease' is a result of some mechanical process with a known sequence of intermediary stages.","image":"c0ebbd97a0beeb738694e4c08ba584958fe27c07.svg","url":"Accelerated_failure_time_model"}
