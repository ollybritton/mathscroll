{"title":"Cyclotomic polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, the nth cyclotomic polynomial, for any positive integer n, is the unique irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients that is a divisor of x n − 1 {\\displaystyle x^{n}-1} and is not a divisor of x k − 1 {\\displaystyle x^{k}-1} for any k < n. Its roots are all nth primitive roots of unity e 2 i π k n {\\displaystyle e^{2i\\pi {\\frac {k}{n}}}} , where k runs over the positive integers not greater than n and coprime to n (and i is the imaginary unit). In other words, the nth cyclotomic polynomial is equal to","image":"44f460268854ef833e68946b550e5ec0ad8f7cde.svg","url":"Cyclotomic_polynomial"}
