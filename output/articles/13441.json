{"title":"Retract (group theory)","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a subgroup of a group is termed a retract if there is an endomorphism of the group that maps surjectively to the subgroup and is identity on the subgroup. In symbols, H {\\displaystyle H} is a retract of G {\\displaystyle G} if and only if there is an endomorphism σ : G → G {\\displaystyle \\sigma :G\\to G} such that σ ( h ) = h {\\displaystyle \\sigma (h)=h} for all h ∈ H {\\displaystyle h\\in H} and σ ( g ) ∈ H {\\displaystyle \\sigma (g)\\in H} for all g ∈ G {\\displaystyle g\\in G} .[1][2]","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Retract_(group_theory)"}
