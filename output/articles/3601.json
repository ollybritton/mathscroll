{"title":"Cubic-icosahedral honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the cubic-icosahedral honeycomb is a compact uniform honeycomb, constructed from icosahedron, cube, and cuboctahedron cells, in an icosidodecahedron vertex figure. It has a single-ring Coxeter diagram, , and is named by its two regular cells.","image":"CDel_label5.png.webp","url":"Cubic-icosahedral_honeycomb"}
