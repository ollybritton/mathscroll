{"title":"Elliptic boundary value problem","summary":"In mathematics, an elliptic boundary value problem is a special kind of boundary value problem which can be thought of as the stable state of an evolution problem. For example, the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian gives the eventual distribution of heat in a room several hours after the heating is turned on.","image":"Boundary_value_problem-en.svg.png.webp","url":"Elliptic_boundary_value_problem"}
