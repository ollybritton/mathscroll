{"title":"Sonja Lyttkens","summary":"Sonja Lyttkens (26 August 1919 – 18 December 2014)[1] was a Swedish mathematician, the third woman to earn a mathematics doctorate in Sweden and the first of these women to obtain a permanent university position in mathematics.[2] She is also known for her work to make academia less hostile to women,[3] and for pointing out that the Swedish taxation system of the time, which provided an income deduction for husbands of non-working wives, pressured women even in low-income families not to work. Her observations helped push Sweden into taxing married people separately from their spouses.[4][5]","image":"Sonja_Lyttkens.jpg.webp","url":"Sonja_Lyttkens"}
