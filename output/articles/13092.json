{"title":"Random field","summary":"In physics and mathematics, a random field is a random function over an arbitrary domain (usually a multi-dimensional space such as R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} ). That is, it is a function f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} that takes on a random value at each point x âˆˆ R n {\\displaystyle x\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} (or some other domain). It is also sometimes thought of as a synonym for a stochastic process with some restriction on its index set.[1] That is, by modern definitions, a random field is a generalization of a stochastic process where the underlying parameter need no longer be real or integer valued \"time\" but can instead take values that are multidimensional vectors or points on some manifold.[2]","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Random_field"}
