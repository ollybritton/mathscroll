{"title":"Toroidal and poloidal coordinates","summary":"The terms toroidal and poloidal refer to directions relative to a torus of reference. They describe a three-dimensional coordinate system in which the poloidal direction follows a small circular ring around the surface, while the toroidal direction follows a large circular ring around the torus, encircling the central void.","image":"Toroidal_coord.png.webp","url":"Toroidal_and_poloidal_coordinates"}
