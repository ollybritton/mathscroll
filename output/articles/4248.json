{"title":"Discrete calculus","summary":"Discrete calculus or the calculus of discrete functions, is the mathematical study of incremental change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations. The word calculus is a Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\"; as such pebbles were used for calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. Meanwhile, calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or \"the calculus of infinitesimals\", is the study of continuous change.","image":"f3890eb866b6258d7a304fc34c70ee3fb3a81a70.svg","url":"Discrete_calculus"}
