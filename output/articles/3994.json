His most recent game, 36 Cube,[1] has been described by Reuters as \"a wolf in sheep's clothing\"[2] because its simple design belies the sophisticated mathematical intuition required for the solution. He received a B.A. in mathematics from Yale and a Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT.[3] Dr. Niederman is a math professor at the College of Charleston.[4]","image":"36Cube.JPG.webp","url":"Derrick_Niederman"}
