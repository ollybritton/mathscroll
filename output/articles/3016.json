{"title":"Complex inverse Wishart distribution","summary":"The complex inverse Wishart distribution is a matrix probability distribution defined on complex-valued positive-definite matrices and is the complex analog of the real inverse Wishart distribution.  The complex Wishart distribution was extensively investigated by Goodman[1] while the derivation of the inverse is shown by Shaman[2] and others.   It has greatest application in least squares optimization theory applied to complex valued data samples in digital radio communications systems, often related to Fourier Domain complex filtering.","image":"8c9453e91c80a8739f9e946f37ff3ebed18ff075.svg","url":"Complex_inverse_Wishart_distribution"}
