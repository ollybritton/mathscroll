{"title":"Legendrian knot","summary":"In mathematics, a Legendrian knot often refers to a smooth embedding of the circle into R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} , which is tangent to the standard contact structure on R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} . It is the lowest-dimensional case of a Legendrian submanifold, which is an embedding of a k-dimensional manifold into a (2k+1)-dimensional contact manifold that is always tangent to the contact hyperplane.","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg","url":"Legendrian_knot"}
