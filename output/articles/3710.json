{"title":"Cyclotruncated 8-simplex honeycomb","summary":"In eight-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the cyclotruncated 8-simplex honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). The tessellation fills space by 8-simplex, truncated 8-simplex, bitruncated 8-simplex, tritruncated 8-simplex, and quadritruncated 8-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 2:2:2:2:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.","image":"CDel_branch_11.png.webp","url":"Cyclotruncated_8-simplex_honeycomb"}
