{"title":"Craig's theorem","summary":"In mathematical logic, Craig's theorem states that any recursively enumerable set of well-formed formulas of a first-order language is (primitively) recursively axiomatizable. This result is not related to the well-known Craig interpolation theorem, although both results are named after the same logician, William Craig.","image":"6de1ad86fabeb63a28723061fc6470acf77544b5.svg","url":"Craig's_theorem"}
