{"title":"3-dimensional matching","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, a 3-dimensional matching is a generalization of bipartite matching (also known as 2-dimensional matching) to 3-partite hypergraphs, which consist of hyperedges each of which contains 3 vertices (instead of edges containing 2 vertices in a usual graph).","image":"3-dimensional-matching.svg.png.webp","url":"3-dimensional_matching"}
