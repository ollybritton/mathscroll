{"title":"Grade (slope)","summary":"The grade (also called slope, incline, gradient, mainfall, pitch or rise) of a physical feature, landform or constructed line refers to the tangent of the angle of that surface to the horizontal. It is a special case of the slope, where zero indicates horizontality. A larger number indicates higher or steeper degree of \"tilt\". Often slope is calculated as a ratio of \"rise\" to \"run\", or as a fraction (\"rise over run\") in which run is the horizontal distance (not the distance along the slope) and rise is the vertical distance.","image":"Grade_dimension.svg.png.webp","url":"Grade_(slope)"}
