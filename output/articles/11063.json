{"title":"Nicholson–Bailey model","summary":"The  Nicholson–Bailey model was developed in the 1930s to describe the population dynamics of a coupled host-parasitoid system.a It is named after Alexander John Nicholson and Victor Albert Bailey. Host-parasite and prey-predator systems can also be represented with the Nicholson-Bailey model. The model is closely related to the Lotka–Volterra model, which describes the dynamics of antagonistic populations (preys and predators) using differential equations.","image":"4c50701ffb9f598077043371bc6177d4331db0cb.svg","url":"Nicholson–Bailey_model"}
