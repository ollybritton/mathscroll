{"title":"Polynomial greatest common divisor","summary":"In algebra, the greatest common divisor (frequently abbreviated as GCD) of two polynomials is a polynomial, of the highest possible degree, that is a factor of both the two original polynomials. This concept is analogous to the greatest common divisor of two integers.","image":"fdd292761553ad3380aa7380b63a5f42a2faea52.svg","url":"Polynomial_greatest_common_divisor"}
