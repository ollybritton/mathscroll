{"title":"Infinite skew polygon","summary":"In geometry, an infinite skew polygon or skew apeirogon is an infinite 2-polytope with vertices that are not all colinear. Infinite zig-zag skew polygons are 2-dimensional infinite skew polygons with vertices alternating between two parallel lines. Infinite helical polygons are 3-dimensional infinite skew polygons with vertices on the surface of a cylinder.","image":"Regular_zig-zag.svg.png.webp","url":"Infinite_skew_polygon"}
