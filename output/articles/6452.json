{"title":"Graph Fourier transform","summary":"In mathematics, the graph Fourier transform is a mathematical transform which eigendecomposes the Laplacian matrix of a graph into eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Analogously to the classical Fourier Transform, the eigenvalues represent frequencies and eigenvectors form what is known as a graph Fourier basis.","image":"644a8d85ee410b6159ca2bdb5dcb9097e2c8f182.svg","url":"Graph_Fourier_transform"}
