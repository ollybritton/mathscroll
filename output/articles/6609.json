{"title":"Grothendieck trace theorem","summary":"In functional analysis, the Grothendieck trace theorem is an extension of Lidskii's theorem about the trace and the determinant of a certain class of nuclear operators on Banach spaces, the so-called 2 3 {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {2}{3}}} -nuclear operators.[1] The theorem was proven in 1966 by Alexander Grothendieck.[2] Lidskii's theorem does not hold in general for Banach spaces.","image":"571a6ce6d697175e9e5e723b8c40eaa7efcfeaca.svg","url":"Grothendieck_trace_theorem"}
