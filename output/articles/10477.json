{"title":"Min-max theorem","summary":"In linear algebra and functional analysis, the min-max theorem, or variational theorem, or Courant–Fischer–Weyl min-max principle, is a result that gives a variational characterization of eigenvalues of compact Hermitian operators on Hilbert spaces. It can be viewed as the starting point of many results of similar nature.","image":"cc03b154fba42316af2eef7a166cff58510ceee6.svg","url":"Min-max_theorem"}
