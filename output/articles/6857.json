{"title":"Handlebody","summary":"In the mathematical field of geometric topology, a handlebody is a decomposition of a manifold into standard pieces. Handlebodies play an important role in Morse theory, cobordism theory and the surgery theory of high-dimensional manifolds. Handles are used to particularly study 3-manifolds.","image":"Triple_torus_illustration.png.webp","url":"Handlebody"}
