{"title":"Higgs bundle","summary":"In mathematics, a Higgs bundle is a pair ( E , φ ) {\\displaystyle (E,\\varphi )} consisting of a holomorphic vector bundle E and a Higgs field φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } , a holomorphic 1-form taking values in the bundle of endomorphisms of E such that φ ∧ φ = 0 {\\displaystyle \\varphi \\wedge \\varphi =0} . Such pairs were introduced by Nigel Hitchin (1987),[1] who named the field φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } after Peter Higgs because of an analogy with Higgs bosons. The term 'Higgs bundle', and the condition φ ∧ φ = 0 {\\displaystyle \\varphi \\wedge \\varphi =0} (which is vacuous in Hitchin's original set-up on Riemann surfaces) was introduced later by Carlos Simpson.[2]","image":"0de33cd31bfa7d0b2620c5c85d8680e5abd2e86c.svg","url":"Higgs_bundle"}
