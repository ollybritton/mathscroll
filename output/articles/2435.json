{"title":"Centrality","summary":"In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality assign numbers or rankings to nodes within a graph corresponding to their network position. Applications include identifying the most influential person(s) in a social network, key infrastructure nodes in the Internet or urban networks, super-spreaders of disease, and brain networks.[1][2] Centrality concepts were first developed in social network analysis, and many of the terms used to measure centrality reflect their sociological origin.[3]","image":"Internet_map_1024.jpg.webp","url":"Centrality"}
