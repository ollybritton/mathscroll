{"title":"Comb space","summary":"In mathematics, particularly topology, a comb space is a particular subspace of R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} that resembles a comb. The comb space has properties that serve as a number of counterexamples. The topologist's sine curve has similar properties to the comb space.  The deleted comb space is a variation on the comb space.","image":"e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd.svg","url":"Comb_space"}
