{"title":"Prestack","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a prestack F over a category C equipped with some Grothendieck topology is a category together with a functor p: F â†’ C satisfying a certain lifting condition and such that (when the fibers are groupoids) locally isomorphic objects are isomorphic. A stack is a prestack with effective descents, meaning local objects may be patched together to become a global object.","image":"c66d3f389313da08201d63cee44500df224b5fa3.svg","url":"Prestack"}
