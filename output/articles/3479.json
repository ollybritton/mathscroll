{"title":"Countably barrelled space","summary":"In functional analysis, a topological vector space (TVS) is said to be countably barrelled if every weakly bounded countable union of equicontinuous subsets of its continuous dual space is again equicontinuous. This property is a generalization of barrelled spaces.","image":"d7a3a5819cc45f097de14b3ac5a8bedd902bc66d.svg","url":"Countably_barrelled_space"}
