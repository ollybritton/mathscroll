{"title":"Finite intersection property","summary":"In general topology, a branch of mathematics, a non-empty family A of subsets of a set X {\\displaystyle X} is said to have the finite intersection property (FIP) if the intersection over any finite subcollection of A {\\displaystyle A} is non-empty. It has the strong finite intersection property (SFIP) if the intersection over any finite subcollection of A {\\displaystyle A} is infinite.  Sets with the finite intersection property are also called centered systems and filter subbases.[1]","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Finite_intersection_property"}
