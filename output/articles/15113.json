{"title":"Straightening theorem for vector fields","summary":"In differential calculus, the domain-straightening theorem states that, given a vector field X {\\displaystyle X} on a manifold, there exist local coordinates y 1 , … , y n {\\displaystyle y_{1},\\dots ,y_{n}} such that X = ∂ / ∂ y 1 {\\displaystyle X=\\partial /\\partial y_{1}} in a neighborhood of a point where X {\\displaystyle X} is nonzero. The theorem is also known as straightening out of a vector field.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Straightening_theorem_for_vector_fields"}
