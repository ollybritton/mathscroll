{"title":"Jacobi polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, Jacobi polynomials (occasionally called hypergeometric polynomials) P n ( α , β ) ( x ) {\\displaystyle P_{n}^{(\\alpha ,\\beta )}(x)} are a class of classical orthogonal polynomials. They are orthogonal with respect to the weight ( 1 − x ) α ( 1 + x ) β {\\displaystyle (1-x)^{\\alpha }(1+x)^{\\beta }} on the interval [ − 1 , 1 ] {\\displaystyle [-1,1]} . The Gegenbauer polynomials, and thus also the Legendre, Zernike and Chebyshev polynomials, are special cases of the Jacobi polynomials.[1]","image":"2594fb2b13259616c95748f0eb78c63b5711f979.svg","url":"Jacobi_polynomials"}
