{"title":"Proof of impossibility","summary":"In mathematics, a proof of impossibility is a proof that demonstrates that a particular problem cannot be solved as described in the claim, or that a particular set of problems cannot be solved in general. Such a case is also known as a negative proof, proof of an impossibility theorem, or negative result. Proofs of impossibility often are the resolutions to decades or centuries of work attempting to find a solution, eventually proving that there is no solution. Proving that something is impossible is usually much harder than the opposite task, as it is often necessary to develop a proof that works in general, rather than to just show a particular example.[1] Impossibility theorems are usually expressible as negative existential propositions or universal propositions in logic.","image":"38821d1f80acbfc4b3f179a1474300336568f245.svg","url":"Proof_of_impossibility"}
