{"title":"Infinite-dimensional holomorphy","summary":"In mathematics, infinite-dimensional holomorphy is a branch of functional analysis. It is concerned with generalizations of the concept of holomorphic function to functions defined and taking values in complex Banach spaces (or Fr√©chet spaces more generally), typically of infinite dimension. It is one aspect of nonlinear functional analysis.","image":"3a2dae230cc8c67a0f1a1951c1a09b7f33d197f7.svg","url":"Infinite-dimensional_holomorphy"}
