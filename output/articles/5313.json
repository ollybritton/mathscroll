{"title":"Feasible region","summary":"In mathematical optimization, a feasible region, feasible set, search space, or solution space is the set of all possible points (sets of values of the choice variables) of an optimization problem that satisfy the problem's constraints, potentially including inequalities, equalities, and integer constraints.[1] This is the initial set of candidate solutions to the problem, before the set of candidates has been narrowed down.","image":"IP_polytope_with_LP_relaxation.svg.png.webp","url":"Feasible_region"}
