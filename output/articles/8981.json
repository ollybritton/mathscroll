{"title":"Lamb–Chaplygin dipole","summary":"The Lamb–Chaplygin dipole model is a mathematical description for a particular inviscid and steady dipolar vortex flow. It is a non-trivial solution to the two-dimensional Euler equations. The model is named after Horace Lamb and Sergey Alexeyevich Chaplygin, who independently discovered this flow structure.[1] This dipole is the two-dimensional analogue of Hill's spherical vortex.","image":"Lamb-Chaplygin_dipole.png.webp","url":"Lamb–Chaplygin_dipole"}
