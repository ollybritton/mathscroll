{"title":"Credal set","summary":"In mathematics, a credal set is a set of probability distributions[1] or, more generally, a set of (possibly only finitely additive) probability measures.  A credal set is often assumed or constructed to be a   closed convex set.  It is intended to express uncertainty or doubt about the probability model that should be used, or to convey the beliefs of a Bayesian agent about the possible states of the world.[2]","image":"4442ce250816e1f0ccae4e392b10c1c63f95566a.svg","url":"Credal_set"}
