{"title":"Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors theorem","summary":"The Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors theorem states that the number of asymptotic values attained by a non-constant entire function of order ρ on curves going outwards toward infinite absolute value is less than or equal to 2ρ. It was first conjectured by Arnaud Denjoy in 1907.[1] Torsten Carleman showed that the number of asymptotic values was less than or equal to (5/2)ρ in 1921.[2] In 1929 Lars Ahlfors confirmed Denjoy's conjecture of 2ρ.[3] Finally, in 1933, Carleman published a very short proof.[4]","image":"fc14dcff41f956163726d55369923012da262b3c.svg","url":"Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors_theorem"}
