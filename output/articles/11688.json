{"title":"P-recursive equation","summary":"In mathematics a P-recursive equation is a linear equation of sequences where the coefficient sequences can be represented as polynomials. P-recursive equations are linear recurrence equations (or linear recurrence relations or linear difference equations) with polynomial coefficients. These equations play an important role in different areas of mathematics, specifically in combinatorics. The sequences which are solutions of these equations are called holonomic, P-recursive or D-finite.","image":"848eae66c9e74806f859bb724609bbf93dc91d52.svg","url":"P-recursive_equation"}
