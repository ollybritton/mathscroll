{"title":"Alexandroff extension","summary":"In the mathematical field of topology, the Alexandroff extension is a way to extend a noncompact topological space by adjoining a single point in such a way that the resulting space is compact.  It is named after the Russian mathematician Pavel Alexandroff. More precisely, let X be a topological space.  Then the Alexandroff extension of X is a certain compact space X* together with an open embedding c : X → X* such that the complement of X in X* consists of a single point, typically denoted ∞.  The map c is a Hausdorff compactification if and only if X is a locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff space.  For such spaces the Alexandroff extension is called the one-point compactification or Alexandroff compactification.  The advantages of the Alexandroff compactification lie in its simple, often geometrically meaningful structure and the fact that it is in a precise sense minimal among all compactifications; the disadvantage lies in the fact that it only gives a Hausdorff compactification on the class of locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff spaces, unlike the Stone–Čech compactification which exists for any topological space (but provides an embedding exactly for Tychonoff spaces).","image":"8a4b5952db09a268e1f0e85078834486a0e7b37d.svg","url":"Alexandroff_extension"}
