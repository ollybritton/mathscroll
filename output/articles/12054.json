{"title":"Persistent homology","summary":"Persistent homology is a method for computing topological features of a space at  different spatial resolutions. More persistent features are detected over a wide range of spatial scales and are deemed more likely to represent true features of the underlying space rather than artifacts of sampling, noise, or particular choice of parameters.[1]","image":"db0a37a7888e4ac8cccfdd6c1fc8dd109803dccd.svg","url":"Persistent_homology"}
