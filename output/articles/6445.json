{"title":"Granny knot (mathematics)","summary":"In knot theory, the granny knot is a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of two identical trefoil knots.  It is closely related to the square knot, which can also be described as a connected sum of two trefoils.  Because the trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot, the granny knot and the square knot are the simplest of all composite knots.","image":"Math-granny-knot-6crossings.svg.png.webp","url":"Granny_knot_(mathematics)"}
