{"title":"Deformation (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, deformation theory is the study of infinitesimal conditions associated with varying a solution P of a problem to slightly different solutions Pε, where ε is a small number, or a vector of small quantities. The infinitesimal conditions are the result of applying the approach of differential calculus to solving a problem with constraints. The name is an analogy to non-rigid structures that deform slightly to accommodate external forces.","image":"a37121345f12ddfccec85cb5e9586048250dffe6.svg","url":"Deformation_(mathematics)"}
