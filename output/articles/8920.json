{"title":"L-notation","summary":"L-notation is an asymptotic notation analogous to big-O notation, denoted as L n [ Î± , c ] {\\displaystyle L_{n}[\\alpha ,c]} for a bound variable n {\\displaystyle n} tending to infinity. Like big-O notation, it is usually used to roughly convey the rate of growth of a function, such as the computational complexity of a particular algorithm.","image":"4bc08a186e75571e0bee47eaafc610206275f961.svg","url":"L-notation"}
