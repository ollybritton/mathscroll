{"title":"Littlewood subordination theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Littlewood subordination theorem, proved by J. E. Littlewood in 1925, is a theorem in operator theory and complex analysis. It states that any holomorphic univalent self-mapping of  the unit disk in the complex numbers that fixes 0 induces a contractive composition operator on various function spaces of holomorphic functions on the disk. These spaces include the Hardy spaces, the Bergman spaces and Dirichlet space.","image":"69c04e415afd2ec77e139b7090475a406f7167fa.svg","url":"Littlewood_subordination_theorem"}
