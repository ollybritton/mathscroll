{"title":"Gibbs' inequality","summary":"In information theory, Gibbs' inequality is a statement about the information entropy of a discrete probability distribution. Several other bounds on the entropy of probability distributions are derived from Gibbs' inequality, including Fano's inequality. It was first presented by J. Willard Gibbs in the 19th century.","image":"Josiah_Willard_Gibbs_-from_MMS-.jpg.webp","url":"Gibbs'_inequality"}
