{"title":"Specht module","summary":"In mathematics, a Specht module is one of the representations of symmetric groups studied by Wilhelm SpechtÂ (1935). They are indexed by partitions, and in characteristic 0 the Specht modules of partitions of n form a complete set of irreducible representations of the symmetric group on n points.","image":"3183c8ced500768421aa5039ac010066d8122ae3.svg","url":"Specht_module"}
