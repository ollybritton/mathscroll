{"title":"Braikenridge–Maclaurin theorem","summary":"In geometry, the .mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#b1d2ff}Braikenridge–Maclaurin theorem, named for 18th century British mathematicians William Braikenridge and Colin Maclaurin,[1] is the converse to Pascal's theorem.  It states that if the three intersection points of the three pairs of lines through opposite sides of a hexagon lie on a line L, then the six vertices of the hexagon lie on a conic C; the conic may be degenerate, as in Pappus's theorem.[2]","image":"Braikenridge–Maclaurin_theorem.svg.png.webp","url":"Braikenridge–Maclaurin_theorem"}
