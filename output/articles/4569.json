{"title":"E8 lattice","summary":"In mathematics, the E8 lattice is a special lattice in R8. It can be characterized as the unique positive-definite, even, unimodular lattice of rank 8. The name derives from the fact that it is the root lattice of the E8 root system.","image":"f2f8bfa32e79cb3d3429faee889c092eab2a1669.svg","url":"E8_lattice"}
