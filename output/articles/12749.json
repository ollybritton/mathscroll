{"title":"Pullback (differential geometry)","summary":"Let ϕ : M → N {\\displaystyle \\phi :M\\to N} be a smooth map between smooth manifolds M {\\displaystyle M} and N {\\displaystyle N} . Then there is an associated linear map from the space of 1-forms on N {\\displaystyle N} (the linear space of sections of the cotangent bundle) to the space of 1-forms on M {\\displaystyle M} . This linear map is known as the pullback (by ϕ {\\displaystyle \\phi } ), and is frequently denoted by ϕ ∗ {\\displaystyle \\phi ^{*}} .  More generally, any covariant tensor field – in particular any differential form – on N {\\displaystyle N} may be pulled back to M {\\displaystyle M} using ϕ {\\displaystyle \\phi } .","image":"6bfadc4f6f042375c74435ab07119cab91262340.svg","url":"Pullback_(differential_geometry)"}
