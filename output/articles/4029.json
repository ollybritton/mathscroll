{"title":"Deviance (statistics)","summary":"In statistics, deviance is a goodness-of-fit statistic for a statistical model; it is often used for statistical hypothesis testing. It is a generalization of the idea of using the sum of squares of residuals (SSR) in ordinary least squares to cases where model-fitting is achieved by maximum likelihood. It plays an important role in exponential dispersion models and generalized linear models.","image":"5a8a9058f15406e408b0e35d52614156735a3a0a.svg","url":"Deviance_(statistics)"}
