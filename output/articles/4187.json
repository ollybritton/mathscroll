{"title":"Direct sum of modules","summary":"In abstract algebra, the direct sum is a construction which combines several modules into a new, larger module. The direct sum of modules is the smallest module which contains the given modules as submodules with no \"unnecessary\" constraints, making it an example of a coproduct. Contrast with the direct product, which is the dual notion.","image":"bf54248f02160a74c4384840a436a2385b0d0ffe.svg","url":"Direct_sum_of_modules"}
