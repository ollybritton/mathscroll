{"title":"Lie algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Lie algebra (pronounced /liː/ LEE) is a vector space g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} together with an operation called the Lie bracket, an alternating bilinear map g × g → g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}\\times {\\mathfrak {g}}\\rightarrow {\\mathfrak {g}}} , that satisfies the Jacobi identity. The Lie bracket of two vectors x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} is denoted [ x , y ] {\\displaystyle [x,y]} .[lower-alpha 1] The vector space g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} together with this operation is a non-associative algebra, meaning that the Lie bracket is not necessarily associative.","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Lie_algebra"}
