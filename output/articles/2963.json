{"title":"Complement graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the complement or inverse of a graph G is a graph H on the same vertices such that two distinct vertices of H are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent in G. That is, to generate the complement of a graph, one fills in all the missing edges required to form a complete graph, and removes all the edges that were previously there.[1]","image":"Petersen_graph_complement.svg.png.webp","url":"Complement_graph"}
