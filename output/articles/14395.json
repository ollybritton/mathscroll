{"title":"Simple Lie group","summary":"In mathematics, a simple Lie group is a connected non-abelian Lie group G which does not have nontrivial connected normal subgroups. The list of simple Lie groups can be used to read off the list of simple Lie algebras and Riemannian symmetric spaces.","image":"E8Petrie.svg.png.webp","url":"Simple_Lie_group"}
