{"title":"Gromov's systolic inequality for essential manifolds","summary":"In the mathematical field of Riemannian geometry, M. Gromov's systolic inequality bounds the length of the shortest non-contractible loop on a Riemannian manifold in terms of the volume of the manifold. Gromov's systolic inequality was proved in 1983;[1] it can be viewed as a generalisation, albeit non-optimal, of Loewner's torus inequality and Pu's inequality for the real projective plane.","image":"bea0bce6f9e800249a03eaba0d4d389b1f12d034.svg","url":"Gromov's_systolic_inequality_for_essential_manifolds"}
