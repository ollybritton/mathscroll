{"title":"Continuous linear extension","summary":"In functional analysis, it is often convenient to define a linear transformation on a complete, normed vector space X {\\displaystyle X} by first defining a linear transformation L {\\displaystyle L} on a dense subset of X {\\displaystyle X} and then continuously extending L {\\displaystyle L} to the whole space via the theorem below. The resulting extension remains linear and bounded, and is thus continuous, which makes it a continuous linear extension.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Continuous_linear_extension"}
