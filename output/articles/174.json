{"title":"Mathematical constant","summary":"A mathematical constant is a key number whose value is fixed by an unambiguous definition, often referred to by a special symbol (e.g., an alphabet letter), or by mathematicians' names to facilitate using it across multiple mathematical problems.[1] Constants arise in many areas of mathematics, with constants such as e and Ï€ occurring in such diverse contexts as geometry, number theory, statistics, and calculus.","image":"Pi-unrolled-720.gif","url":"A%2fMathematical_constant"}
