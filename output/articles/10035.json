{"title":"Material nonimplication","summary":"Material nonimplication or abjunction (Latin ab = \"from\", junctio =–\"joining\") is the negation of material implication. That is to say that for any two propositions P {\\displaystyle P} and Q {\\displaystyle Q} , the material nonimplication from P {\\displaystyle P} to Q {\\displaystyle Q} is true if and only if the negation of the material implication from P {\\displaystyle P} to Q {\\displaystyle Q} is true.  This is more naturally stated as that the material nonimplication from P {\\displaystyle P} to Q {\\displaystyle Q} is true only if P {\\displaystyle P} is true and Q {\\displaystyle Q} is false.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg","url":"Material_nonimplication"}
