{"title":"Dagger symmetric monoidal category","summary":"In the mathematical field of category theory, a dagger symmetric monoidal category is a monoidal category ⟨ C , ⊗ , I ⟩ {\\displaystyle \\langle \\mathbf {C} ,\\otimes ,I\\rangle } that also possesses a dagger structure. That is, this category comes equipped not only with a tensor product in the category theoretic sense but also with a dagger structure, which is used to describe unitary morphisms and self-adjoint morphisms in C {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {C} } : abstract analogues of those found in FdHilb, the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This type of category was introduced by Peter Selinger[1] as an intermediate structure between dagger categories and the dagger compact categories that are used in categorical quantum mechanics, an area that now also considers dagger symmetric monoidal categories when dealing with infinite-dimensional quantum mechanical concepts.","image":"74b810440467e7ef4e184d5ffeb521b07e19ce8c.svg","url":"Dagger_symmetric_monoidal_category"}
