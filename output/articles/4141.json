{"title":"Diminished rhombic dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, a diminished rhombic dodecahedron is a rhombic dodecahedron with one or more vertices removed. This article describes diminishing one 4-valence vertex. This diminishment creates one new square face while 4 rhombic faces are reduced to triangles. It has 13 vertices, 24 edges, and 13 faces. It has C4v symmetry, order 8.","image":"Diminished_rhombic_dodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Diminished_rhombic_dodecahedron"}
