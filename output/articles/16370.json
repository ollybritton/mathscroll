{"title":"Uniform tiling symmetry mutations","summary":"In geometry, a symmetry mutation is a mapping of fundamental domains between two symmetry groups.[1] They are compactly expressed in orbifold notation. These mutations can occur from spherical tilings to Euclidean tilings to hyperbolic tilings. Hyperbolic tilings can also be divided between compact, paracompact and divergent cases.","image":"Uniform_tiling_332-t01-1-.png.webp","url":"Uniform_tiling_symmetry_mutations"}
