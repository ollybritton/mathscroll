{"title":"Integral transform","summary":"In mathematics, an integral transform maps a function from its original function space into another function space via integration, where some of the properties of the original function might be more easily characterized and manipulated than in the original function space. The transformed function can generally be mapped back to the original function space using the inverse transform.","image":"ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0.svg","url":"Integral_transform"}
