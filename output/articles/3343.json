{"title":"Contourlet","summary":"Contourlets form a multiresolution directional tight frame designed to efficiently approximate images made of smooth regions separated by smooth boundaries. The contourlet transform has a fast implementation based on a Laplacian pyramid decomposition followed by directional filterbanks applied on each bandpass subband.","image":"Contourlet_Transform_Double_Filter_Bank.jpg.webp","url":"Contourlet"}
