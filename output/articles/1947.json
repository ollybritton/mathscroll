{"title":"Brascamp–Lieb inequality","summary":"In mathematics, the Brascamp–Lieb inequality is either of two inequalities. The first is a result in geometry concerning integrable functions on n-dimensional Euclidean space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} . It generalizes the Loomis–Whitney inequality and Hölder's inequality. The second is a result of probability theory which gives a concentration inequality for log-concave probability distributions. Both are named after Herm Jan Brascamp and Elliott H. Lieb.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Brascamp–Lieb_inequality"}
