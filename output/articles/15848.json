{"title":"Topological derivative","summary":"The topological derivative is, conceptually, a derivative of a shape functional with respect to infinitesimal changes in its topology, such as adding an infinitesimal hole or crack. When used in higher dimensions than one, the term topological gradient is also used to name the first-order term of the topological asymptotic expansion, dealing only with infinitesimal singular domain perturbations. It has applications in shape optimization, topology optimization, image processing and mechanical modeling.","image":"24b0d5ca6f381068d756f6337c08e0af9d1eeb6f.svg","url":"Topological_derivative"}
