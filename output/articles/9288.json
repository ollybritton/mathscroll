{"title":"Lifting-the-exponent lemma","summary":"In elementary number theory, the lifting-the-exponent (LTE) lemma provides several formulas for computing the p-adic valuation Î½ p {\\displaystyle \\nu _{p}} of special forms of integers. The lemma is named as such because it describes the steps necessary to \"lift\" the exponent of p {\\displaystyle p} in such expressions. It is related to Hensel's lemma.","image":"927e534c609652bcb337f82c9296cacabdd3281e.svg","url":"Lifting-the-exponent_lemma"}
