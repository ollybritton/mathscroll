{"title":"q-difference polynomial","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, the q-difference polynomials or q-harmonic polynomials are a polynomial sequence defined in terms of the q-derivative. They are a generalized type of Brenke polynomial, and generalize the Appell polynomials.  See also Sheffer sequence.","image":"b2ca72d545aa327046b9836678ce2bb9420de189.svg","url":"Q-difference_polynomial"}
