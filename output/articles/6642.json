{"title":"Growth function","summary":"The growth function, also called the shatter coefficient or the shattering number, measures the richness of a set family. It is especially used in the context of statistical learning theory, where it measures the complexity of a hypothesis class. The term 'growth function' was coined by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in their 1968 paper, where they also proved many of its properties.[1] It is a basic concept in machine learning.[2] [3]","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Growth_function"}
