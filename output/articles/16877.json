{"title":"Whitehead's lemma (Lie algebra)","summary":"In homological algebra, Whitehead's lemmas (named after J. H. C. Whitehead) represent a series of statements regarding representation theory of finite-dimensional, semisimple Lie algebras in characteristic zero. Historically, they are regarded as leading to the discovery of Lie algebra cohomology.[1]","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Whitehead's_lemma_(Lie_algebra)"}
