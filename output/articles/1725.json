{"title":"Bitruncated 24-cell honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the bitruncated 24-cell honeycomb is a uniform space-filling honeycomb. It can be seen as a bitruncation of the regular 24-cell honeycomb, constructed by truncated tesseract and bitruncated 24-cell cells.","image":"CDel_node.png.webp","url":"Bitruncated_24-cell_honeycomb"}
