{"title":"Nilpotence theorem","summary":"In algebraic topology, the nilpotence theorem gives a condition for an element in the homotopy groups of a ring spectrum to be nilpotent, in terms of the complex cobordism spectrum M U {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {MU} } . More precisely, it states that for any ring spectrum R {\\textstyle R} , the kernel of the map π ∗ R → M U ∗ ( R ) {\\textstyle \\pi _{\\ast }R\\to \\mathrm {MU} _{\\ast }(R)} consists of nilpotent elements.[1] It was conjectured by Douglas Ravenel (1984) and proved by Ethan S. Devinatz, Michael J. Hopkins, and Jeffrey H. Smith (1988).","image":"19a2d5808e8ebbaf1a2dfcbaa48b4db61be7ebca.svg","url":"Nilpotence_theorem"}
