{"title":"N = 2 superconformal algebra","summary":"In mathematical physics, the 2D N = 2 superconformal algebra is an infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebra, related to supersymmetry, that occurs in string theory and two-dimensional conformal field theory. It has important applications in mirror symmetry. It was introduced by M. Ademollo, L. Brink, and A. D'Adda et al. (1976) as a gauge algebra of the U(1) fermionic string.","image":"9a4d4aa43deeebccd733e2267a756fdc972ffa11.svg","url":"N_=_2_superconformal_algebra"}
