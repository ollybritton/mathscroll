{"title":"Free algebra","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra known as ring theory, a free algebra is the noncommutative analogue of a polynomial ring since its elements may be described as \"polynomials\" with non-commuting variables. Likewise, the polynomial ring may be regarded as a free commutative algebra.","image":"Latex_integers.svg.png.webp","url":"Free_algebra"}
