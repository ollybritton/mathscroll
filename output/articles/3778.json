{"title":"Darryl Holm","summary":"Darryl Holm (born 4 October 1947) is an American applied mathematician, and Professor of Applied Mathematics and Mathematical Physics in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London.[1] He studied Physics at the University of Minnesota (1963-1967), and Physics and Mathematics at the University of Michigan (1967-1971). He joined the Theoretical Design Division of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in 1972 where he worked on the physics of strong shock waves and high-temperature hydrodynamic phenomena. At LANL Darryl also wrote his PhD dissertation entitled \"Symmetry breaking in fluid dynamics: Lie group reducible motions for real fluids\", receiving his PhD in 1976, supervised by Roy Axford.[2] A result discovered in this work was later used to substantiate the accuracy of the Los Alamos on-site yield verification method (CORRTEX) for the US-USSR Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT).[3] In 1980, Darryl moved to the Theoretical Division, where he helped found the Center for Nonlinear Studies and served as one of its acting directors.[4]","image":"Darryl_Holm.jpg.webp","url":"Darryl_Holm"}
