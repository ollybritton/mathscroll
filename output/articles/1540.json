{"title":"Beta wavelet","summary":"Continuous wavelets of compact support alpha can be built,[1] which are related to the beta distribution.  The process is derived from probability distributions using blur derivative.  These new wavelets have just one cycle, so they are termed unicycle wavelets. They can be viewed as a soft variety of Haar wavelets whose shape is fine-tuned by two parameters α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } and β {\\displaystyle \\beta } .  Closed-form expressions for beta wavelets and scale functions as well as their spectra are derived.  Their importance is due to the Central Limit Theorem by Gnedenko and Kolmogorov applied for compactly supported signals.[2]","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg","url":"Beta_wavelet"}
