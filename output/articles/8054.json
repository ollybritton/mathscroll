{"title":"Ishango bone","summary":"The Ishango bone, discovered at the \"Fisherman Settlement\" of Ishango in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is a bone tool and possible mathematical device that dates to the Upper Paleolithic era.[1] The curved bone is dark brown in color, about 10 centimeters in length, and features a sharp piece of quartz affixed to one end, perhaps for engraving.[1] Because the bone has been narrowed, scraped, polished, and engraved to a certain extent, it is no longer possible to determine what animal the bone belonged to, although it is assumed to belong to a mammal.[2]","image":"Ishango_bone.jpg.webp","url":"Ishango_bone"}
