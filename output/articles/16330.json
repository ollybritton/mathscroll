{"title":"Unconditional convergence","summary":"In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, a series is unconditionally convergent if all reorderings of the series converge to the same value. In contrast, a series is conditionally convergent if it converges but different orderings do not all converge to that same value. Unconditional convergence is equivalent to absolute convergence in finite-dimensional vector spaces, but is a weaker property in infinite dimensions.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Unconditional_convergence"}
