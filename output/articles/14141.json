{"title":"Semiprimitive ring","summary":"In algebra, a semiprimitive ring or Jacobson semisimple ring or J-semisimple ring is a ring whose Jacobson radical is zero. This is a type of ring more general than a semisimple ring, but where simple modules still provide enough information about the ring.  Rings such as the ring of integers are semiprimitive, and an artinian semiprimitive ring is just a semisimple ring.  Semiprimitive rings can be understood as subdirect products of primitive rings, which are described by the Jacobson density theorem.","image":"Latex_integers.svg.png.webp","url":"Semiprimitive_ring"}
