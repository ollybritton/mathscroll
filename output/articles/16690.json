{"title":"Von Neumann stability analysis","summary":"In numerical analysis, von Neumann stability analysis (also known as Fourier stability analysis) is a procedure used to check the stability of finite difference schemes as applied to linear partial differential equations.[1] The analysis is based on the Fourier decomposition of numerical error and was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory after having been briefly described in a 1947 article by British researchers Crank and Nicolson.[2] This method is an example of explicit time integration where the function that defines governing equation is evaluated at the current time. Later, the method was given a more rigorous treatment in an article[3] co-authored by John von Neumann.","image":"1aec8a435e5ce3588f59f31116e9c92687faee4b.svg","url":"Von_Neumann_stability_analysis"}
