{"title":"Generating function transformation","summary":"In mathematics, a transformation of a sequence's generating function provides a method of converting the generating function for one sequence into a generating function enumerating another. These transformations typically involve integral formulas applied to a sequence generating function (see integral transformations) or weighted sums over the higher-order derivatives of these functions (see derivative transformations).","image":"cff7047d8cbca52dd1c08a01edf96377eccc6b0f.svg","url":"Generating_function_transformation"}
