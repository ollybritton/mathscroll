{"title":"Pentagonal orthobicupola","summary":"In geometry, the pentagonal orthobicupola is one of the Johnson solids (J30). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by joining two pentagonal cupolae (J5) along their decagonal bases, matching like faces. A 36-degree rotation of one cupola before the joining yields a pentagonal gyrobicupola (J31).","image":"Pentagonal_orthobicupola.png.webp","url":"Pentagonal_orthobicupola"}
