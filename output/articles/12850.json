{"title":"Quantized enveloping algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a quantum or quantized enveloping algebra is a q-analog of a universal enveloping algebra.[1] Given a Lie algebra g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} , the quantum enveloping algebra is typically denoted as U q ( g ) {\\displaystyle U_{q}({\\mathfrak {g}})} . The notation was introduced by Drinfeld and independently by Jimbo.[2]","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Quantized_enveloping_algebra"}
