{"title":"Observational study","summary":"In fields such as epidemiology, social sciences, psychology  and statistics, an observational study draws inferences from a sample to a population where the independent variable is not under the control of the researcher because of ethical concerns or logistical constraints. One common observational study is about the possible effect of a treatment on subjects, where the assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group is outside the control of the investigator.[1][2] This is in contrast with experiments, such as randomized controlled trials, where each subject is randomly assigned to a treated group or a control group. Observational studies, for lacking an assignment mechanism, naturally present difficulties for inferential analysis.","image":"Blankett%2C_Antropoloogiline_vaatlusleht%2C_vorm_nr._4%2C_1961.jpg.webp","url":"Observational_study"}
