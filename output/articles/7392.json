{"title":"Homotopy lifting property","summary":"In mathematics, in particular in homotopy theory within algebraic topology, the homotopy lifting property (also known as an instance of the right lifting property or the covering homotopy axiom) is a technical condition on a continuous function from a topological space E to another one, B. It is designed to support the picture of E \"above\" B by allowing a homotopy taking place in B to be moved \"upstairs\" to E.","image":"188864d353771fd8e24d463c5946edd7db679f8e.svg","url":"Homotopy_lifting_property"}
