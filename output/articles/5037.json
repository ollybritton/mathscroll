{"title":"Euclidean planes in three-dimensional space","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, a plane is a flat two-dimensional surface that extends indefinitely. Euclidean planes often arise as subspaces of three-dimensional space R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} . A prototypical example is one of a room's walls, infinitely extended and assumed infinitesimal thin. While a pair of real numbers R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} suffices to describe points on a plane, the relationship with out-of-plane points requires special consideration for their embedding in the ambient space R 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}} .","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg","url":"Euclidean_planes_in_three-dimensional_space"}
