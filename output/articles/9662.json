{"title":"Logarithmic integral function","summary":"In mathematics, the logarithmic integral function or integral logarithm li(x) is a special function. It is relevant in problems of physics and has number theoretic significance. In particular, according to the prime number theorem, it is a very good approximation to the prime-counting function, which is defined as the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given value x {\\displaystyle x} .","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Logarithmic_integral_function"}
