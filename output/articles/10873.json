{"title":"Möbius plane","summary":"In mathematics, the classical Möbius plane (named after August Ferdinand Möbius) is the Euclidean plane supplemented by a single point at infinity. It is also called the inversive plane because it is closed under inversion with respect to any generalized circle, and thus a natural setting for planar inversive geometry.","image":"Moebius-touching-circles.svg.png.webp","url":"Möbius_plane"}
