{"title":"Rough set","summary":"In computer science, a rough set, first described by Polish computer scientist Zdzis≈Çaw I. Pawlak, is a formal approximation of a crisp set (i.e., conventional set) in terms of a pair of sets which give the lower and the upper approximation of the original set. In the standard version of rough set theory (Pawlak 1991), the lower- and upper-approximation sets are crisp sets, but in other variations, the approximating sets may be fuzzy sets.","image":"e40e87f58829c619a4e052927455c64cd82f8482.svg","url":"Rough_set"}
