{"title":"Descartes on Polyhedra","summary":"Descartes on Polyhedra: A Study of the \"De solidorum elementis\" is a book in the history of mathematics, concerning the work of Ren√© Descartes on polyhedra. Central to the book is the disputed priority for Euler's polyhedral formula between Leonhard Euler, who published an explicit version of the formula, and Descartes, whose De solidorum elementis includes a result from which the formula is easily derived.[1]","image":"73efd1f6493490b058097060a572606d2c550a06.svg","url":"Descartes_on_Polyhedra"}
