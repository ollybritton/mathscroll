{"title":"Cycle basis","summary":"In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, a cycle basis of an undirected graph is a set of simple cycles that forms a basis of the cycle space of the graph. That is, it is a minimal set of cycles that allows every even-degree subgraph to be expressed as a symmetric difference of basis cycles.","image":"Cycle_space_addition.svg.png.webp","url":"Cycle_basis"}
