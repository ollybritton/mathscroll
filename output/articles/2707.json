{"title":"Class number problem","summary":"In mathematics, the Gauss class number problem (for imaginary quadratic fields), as usually understood, is to provide for each n ≥ 1 a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields Q ( d ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} ({\\sqrt {d}})} (for negative integers d) having class number n. It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss. It can also be stated in terms of discriminants. There are related questions for real quadratic fields and for the behavior as d → − ∞ {\\displaystyle d\\to -\\infty } .","image":"9757d116555dd605228d352039f5f491d2967c8a.svg","url":"Class_number_problem"}
