{"title":"Pythagorean field","summary":"In algebra, a Pythagorean field is a field in which every sum of two squares is a square: equivalently it has Pythagoras number equal to 1.  A Pythagorean extension  of a field F {\\displaystyle F} is an extension obtained by adjoining an element 1 + λ 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {1+\\lambda ^{2}}}} for some λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } in F {\\displaystyle F} . So a Pythagorean field is one closed under taking Pythagorean extensions. For any field F {\\displaystyle F} there is a minimal Pythagorean field F p y {\\textstyle F^{\\mathrm {py} }} containing it, unique up to isomorphism, called its Pythagorean closure.[1]  The Hilbert field is the minimal ordered Pythagorean field.[2]","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"Pythagorean_field"}
