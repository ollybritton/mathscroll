{"title":"Gram–Schmidt process","summary":"In mathematics, particularly linear algebra and numerical analysis, the Gram–Schmidt process is a method for orthonormalizing a set of vectors in an inner product space, most commonly the Euclidean space Rn equipped with the standard inner product. The Gram–Schmidt process takes a finite, linearly independent set of vectors S = {v1, ..., vk} for k ≤ n and generates an orthogonal set S′ = {u1, ..., uk} that spans the same k-dimensional subspace of Rn as S.","image":"Gram–Schmidt_process.svg.png.webp","url":"Gram–Schmidt_process"}
