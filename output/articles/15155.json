{"title":"Strongly minimal theory","summary":"In model theory—a branch of mathematical logic—a minimal structure is an infinite one-sorted structure such that every subset of its domain that is definable with parameters is either finite or cofinite. A strongly minimal theory is a complete theory all models of which are minimal. A strongly minimal structure is a structure whose theory is strongly minimal.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Strongly_minimal_theory"}
