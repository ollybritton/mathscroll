{"title":"Khmaladze transformation","summary":"In statistics, the Khmaladze transformation is a mathematical tool used in constructing convenient goodness of fit tests for hypothetical distribution functions. More precisely, suppose X 1 , … , X n {\\displaystyle X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n}} are i.i.d., possibly multi-dimensional, random observations generated from an unknown probability distribution. A classical problem in statistics is to decide how well a given hypothetical distribution function F {\\displaystyle F} , or a given hypothetical parametric family of distribution functions { F θ : θ ∈ Θ } {\\displaystyle \\{F_{\\theta }:\\theta \\in \\Theta \\}} , fits the set of observations. The Khmaladze transformation allows us to construct goodness of fit tests with desirable properties. It is named after Estate V. Khmaladze.","image":"ac794f5521dcce89913085a6d566e7cdb615dbb0.svg","url":"Khmaladze_transformation"}
