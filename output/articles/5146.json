{"title":"Existentially closed model","summary":"In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, the notion of an existentially closed model (or existentially complete model) of a theory generalizes the notions of algebraically closed fields (for the theory of fields), real closed fields (for the theory of ordered fields), existentially closed groups (for the theory of groups), and dense linear orders without endpoints (for the theory of linear orders).","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Existentially_closed_model"}
