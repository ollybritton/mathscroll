{"title":"Method of characteristics","summary":"In mathematics, the method of characteristics is a technique for solving partial differential equations.  Typically, it applies to first-order equations, although more generally the method of characteristics is valid for any hyperbolic partial differential equation.  The method is to reduce a partial differential equation to a family of ordinary differential equations along which the solution can be integrated from some initial data given on a suitable hypersurface.","image":"692b3fb37667feb901d44ed7af84926b1adc3d12.svg","url":"Method_of_characteristics"}
