{"title":"Satisfiability","summary":"In mathematical logic, a formula is satisfiable if it is true under some assignment of values to its variables. For example, the formula x + 3 = y {\\displaystyle x+3=y} is satisfiable because it is true when x = 3 {\\displaystyle x=3} and y = 6 {\\displaystyle y=6} , while the formula x + 1 = x {\\displaystyle x+1=x} is not satisfiable over the integers. The dual concept to satisfiability is validity; a formula is valid if every assignment of values to its variables makes the formula true. For example, x + 3 = 3 + x {\\displaystyle x+3=3+x} is valid over the integers, but x + 3 = y {\\displaystyle x+3=y} is not.","image":"b73a8477c56cbf43698603746310b934fbc9d9a6.svg","url":"Satisfiability"}
