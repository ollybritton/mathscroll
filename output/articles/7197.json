{"title":"Higher-order compact finite difference scheme","summary":"High-order compact finite difference schemes are used for solving third-order differential equations created during the study of obstacle boundary value problems. They have been shown to be highly accurate and efficient. They are constructed by modifying the second-order scheme that was developed by Noor and Al-Said in 2002. The convergence rate of the high-order compact scheme is third order, the second-order scheme is fourth order.[1]","image":"HOC_stencil.jpg.webp","url":"Higher-order_compact_finite_difference_scheme"}
