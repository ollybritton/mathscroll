{"title":"Comparability graph","summary":"In graph theory, a comparability graph is an undirected graph that connects pairs of elements that are comparable to each other in a partial order. Comparability graphs have also been called transitively orientable graphs, partially orderable graphs, containment graphs,[1] and divisor graphs.[2] An incomparability graph is an undirected graph that connects pairs of elements that are not comparable to each other in a partial order.","image":"Poset_et_graphe_de_comparabilit√©.svg.png.webp","url":"Comparability_graph"}
