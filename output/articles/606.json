{"title":"Algebraic number field","summary":"In mathematics, an algebraic number field (or simply number field) is an extension field K {\\displaystyle K} of the field of rational numbers Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } such that the field extension K / Q {\\displaystyle K/\\mathbb {Q} } has finite degree (and hence is an algebraic field extension). Thus K {\\displaystyle K} is a field that contains Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } and has finite dimension when considered as a vector space over Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } .","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Algebraic_number_field"}
