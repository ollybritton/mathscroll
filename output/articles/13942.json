{"title":"Schild's ladder","summary":"In the theory of general relativity, and differential geometry more generally, Schild's ladder is a first-order method for approximating parallel transport of a vector along a curve using only affinely parametrized geodesics.  The method is named for Alfred Schild, who introduced the method during lectures at Princeton University.","image":"Schild's_ladder_step_4.svg.png.webp","url":"Schild's_ladder"}
