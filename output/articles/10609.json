{"title":"Moduli stack of formal group laws","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the moduli stack of formal group laws is a stack classifying formal group laws and isomorphisms between them. It is denoted by M FG {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}_{\\text{FG}}} . It is a \"geometric â€œobject\" that underlies the chromatic approach to the stable homotopy theory, a branch of algebraic topology.","image":"2740fce135af7d32ec0fcd00242d14b0066f02f9.svg","url":"Moduli_stack_of_formal_group_laws"}
