{"title":"Homotopy category of chain complexes","summary":"In homological algebra in mathematics, the homotopy category K(A) of chain complexes in an additive category A is a framework for working with chain homotopies and homotopy equivalences.  It lies intermediate between the category of chain complexes Kom(A) of A and the derived category D(A) of A when A is abelian; unlike the former it is a triangulated category, and unlike the latter its formation does not require that A is abelian.  Philosophically, while D(A) turns into isomorphisms any maps of complexes that are quasi-isomorphisms in Kom(A), K(A) does so only for those that are quasi-isomorphisms for a \"good reason\", namely actually having an inverse up to homotopy equivalence.  Thus, K(A) is more understandable than D(A).","image":"df9050a679b834c3aeb2436b2782f87eab029ac4.svg","url":"Homotopy_category_of_chain_complexes"}
