{"title":"Sigma-martingale","summary":"In mathematics and information theory of probability, a sigma-martingale is a semimartingale with an integral representation.  Sigma-martingales were introduced by C.S. Chou and M. Emery in 1977 and 1978.[1]   In financial mathematics, sigma-martingales appear in the fundamental theorem of asset pricing as an equivalent condition to no free lunch with vanishing risk (a no-arbitrage condition).[2]","image":"a713426956296f1668fce772df3c60b9dde8a685.svg","url":"Sigma-martingale"}
