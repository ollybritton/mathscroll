{"title":"Löb's theorem","summary":"In mathematical logic, Löb's theorem states that in Peano arithmetic (PA) (or any formal system including PA), for any formula P, if it is provable in PA that \"if P is provable in PA then P is true\", then P is provable in PA. If Prov(P) means that the formula P is provable, we may express this more formally as","image":"fe77dae2aac68ac05167e53c46cf7feec7a3ead8.svg","url":"Löb's_theorem"}
