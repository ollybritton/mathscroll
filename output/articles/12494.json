{"title":"Prime quadruplet","summary":"In number theory, a prime quadruplet (sometimes called prime quadruple) is a set of four prime numbers of the form { p , p + 2 , p + 6 , p + 8 } . {\\displaystyle \\{p,\\ p+2,\\ p+6,\\ p+8\\}.} [1] This represents the closest possible grouping of four primes larger than 3, and is the only prime constellation of length 4.","image":"b3a4b16ca93067d63f258b635a8999890b001218.svg","url":"Prime_quadruplet"}
