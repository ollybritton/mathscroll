{"title":"Brunn–Minkowski theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Brunn–Minkowski theorem (or Brunn–Minkowski inequality) is an inequality relating the volumes (or more generally Lebesgue measures) of compact subsets of Euclidean space. The original version of the Brunn–Minkowski theorem (Hermann Brunn 1887; Hermann Minkowski 1896) applied to convex sets; the generalization to compact nonconvex sets stated here is due to Lazar Lyusternik (1935).","image":"600ca92c51283182b88385b0d402fc4b8204070e.svg","url":"Brunn–Minkowski_theorem"}
