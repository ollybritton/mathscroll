{"title":"Snub polyhedron","summary":"In geometry, a snub polyhedron is a polyhedron obtained by performing a snub operation: alternating a corresponding omnitruncated or truncated polyhedron, depending on the definition. Some, but not all, authors include antiprisms as snub polyhedra, as they are obtained by this construction from a degenerate \"polyhedron\" with only two faces (a dihedron).","image":"Snubhexahedronccw.gif","url":"Snub_polyhedron"}
