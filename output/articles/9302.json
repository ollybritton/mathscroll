{"title":"Limit (category theory)","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the abstract notion of a limit captures the essential properties of universal constructions such as products, pullbacks and inverse limits.  The dual notion of a colimit generalizes constructions such as disjoint unions, direct sums, coproducts, pushouts and direct limits.","image":"4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029.svg","url":"Limit_(category_theory)"}
