{"title":"k-cell (mathematics)","summary":"A k {\\displaystyle k} -cell is a higher-dimensional version of a rectangle or rectangular solid. It is the Cartesian product of k {\\displaystyle k} closed intervals on the real line.[1] This means that a k {\\displaystyle k} -dimensional rectangular solid has each of its edges equal to one of the closed intervals used in the definition.  The k {\\displaystyle k} intervals need not be identical. For example, a 2-cell is a rectangle in R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} such that the sides of the rectangles are parallel to the coordinate axes. Every k {\\displaystyle k} -cell is compact.[2][3]","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"K-cell_(mathematics)"}
