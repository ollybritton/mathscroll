{"title":"Hexagonal Efficient Coordinate System","summary":"The Hexagonal Efficient Coordinate System (HECS), formerly known as Array Set Addressing (ASA), is a coordinate system for hexagonal grids that allows hexagonally sampled images to be efficiently stored and processed on digital systems. HECS represents the hexagonal grid as a set of two interleaved rectangular sub-arrays, which can be addressed by normal integer row and column coordinates and are distinguished with a single binary coordinate. Hexagonal sampling is the optimal approach for isotropically band-limited two-dimensional signals[1] and its use provides a sampling efficiency improvement of 13.4% over rectangular sampling. The HECS system enables the use of hexagonal sampling for digital imaging applications without requiring significant additional processing to address the hexagonal array.[2]","image":"Hex2RecASA.jpg.webp","url":"Hexagonal_Efficient_Coordinate_System"}
