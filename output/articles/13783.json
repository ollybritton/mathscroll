{"title":"Runcinated 24-cell honeycomb","summary":"In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the runcinated 24-cell honeycomb is a uniform space-filling honeycomb. It can be seen as a runcination of the regular 24-cell honeycomb, containing runcinated 24-cell, 24-cell, octahedral prism, and 3-3 duoprism cells.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Runcinated_24-cell_honeycomb"}
