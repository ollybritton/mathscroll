{"title":"Amitsur complex","summary":"In algebra, the Amitsur complex is a natural complex associated to a ring homomorphism. It was introduced by Shimshon AmitsurÂ (1959). When the homomorphism is faithfully flat, the Amitsur complex is exact (thus determining a resolution), which is the basis of the theory of faithfully flat descent.","image":"d30343783a5f57c4b4f2896cb47dc438851e2685.svg","url":"Amitsur_complex"}
