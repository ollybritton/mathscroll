{"title":"Voltage graph","summary":"In graph theory, a voltage graph is a directed graph whose edges are labelled invertibly by elements of a group.  It is formally identical to a gain graph, but it is generally used in topological graph theory as a concise way to specify another graph called the derived graph of the voltage graph.","image":"cc0d1f84d9effb18518e9b55c1875b59e10221a7.svg","url":"Voltage_graph"}
