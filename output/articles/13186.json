{"title":"Real projective space","summary":"In mathematics, real projective space, denoted R P n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {RP} ^{n}} or P n ( R ) , {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} _{n}(\\mathbb {R} ),} is the topological space of lines passing through the origin 0 in the real space R n + 1 . {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n+1}.} It is a compact, smooth manifold of dimension n, and is a special case G r ( 1 , R n + 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {Gr} (1,\\mathbb {R} ^{n+1})} of a Grassmannian space.","image":"49667cb8bc888139c775ec90afbd9ed5ea417e96.svg","url":"Real_projective_space"}
