{"title":"Chern class","summary":"In mathematics, in particular in algebraic topology, differential geometry and algebraic geometry, the Chern classes are characteristic classes associated with complex vector bundles. They have since become fundamental concepts in many branches of mathematics and physics, such as string theory, Chernâ€“Simons theory, knot theory, Gromov-Witten invariants.","image":"b711408c4ef248563ebab8a86c8860d0b18239f8.svg","url":"Chern_class"}
