{"title":"Topkis's theorem","summary":"In mathematical economics, Topkis's theorem is a result that is useful for establishing comparative statics.  The theorem allows researchers to understand how the optimal value for a choice variable changes when a feature of the environment changes.  The result states that if f is supermodular in (x,θ), and D is a lattice, then x ∗ ( θ ) = arg ⁡ max x ∈ D f ( x , θ ) {\\displaystyle x^{*}(\\theta )=\\arg \\max _{x\\in D}f(x,\\theta )} is nondecreasing in θ.  The result is especially helpful for establishing comparative static results when the objective function is not differentiable. The result is named after Donald M. Topkis.","image":"eaa2e3328e38337c4aa45ff5f1cbe592b55c3318.svg","url":"Topkis's_theorem"}
