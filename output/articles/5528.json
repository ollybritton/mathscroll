{"title":"Flip graph","summary":"In mathematics, a flip graph is a graph whose vertices are combinatorial or geometric objects, and whose edges link two of these objects when they can be obtained from one another by an elementary operation called a flip. Flip graphs are special cases of geometric graphs.","image":"Flip_graphs.svg.png.webp","url":"Flip_graph"}
