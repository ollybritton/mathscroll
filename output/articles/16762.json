{"title":"Weak Hausdorff space","summary":"In mathematics, a weak Hausdorff space or weakly Hausdorff space is a topological space where the image of every continuous map from a compact Hausdorff space into the space is closed.[1] In particular, every Hausdorff space is weak Hausdorff.  As a separation property, it is stronger than T1, which is equivalent to the statement that points are closed. Specifically, every weak Hausdorff space is a T1 space.[2][3]","image":"ed6933a174f0332b0c778d094aec7dc5cdd0befe.svg","url":"Weak_Hausdorff_space"}
