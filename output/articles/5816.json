{"title":"Function approximation","summary":"In general, a function approximation problem asks us to select a function among a well-defined class that closely matches (\"approximates\") a target function in a task-specific way.[1] The need for function approximations arises in many branches of applied mathematics, and computer science in particular , such as predicting the growth of microbes in microbiology.[2] Function approximations are used where theoretical models are unavailable or hard to compute.[2]","image":"Step_function_approximation.png.webp","url":"Function_approximation"}
