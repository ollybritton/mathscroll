{"title":"Chvátal–Sankoff constants","summary":"In mathematics, the Chvátal–Sankoff constants are mathematical constants that describe the lengths of longest common subsequences of random strings. Although the existence of these constants has been proven, their exact values are unknown. They are named after Václav Chvátal and David Sankoff, who began investigating them in the mid-1970s.[1][2]","image":"2fe92cc350733480812673fa7deeaf7ad0bf70f1.svg","url":"Chvátal–Sankoff_constants"}
