{"title":"Additive K-theory","summary":"In mathematics, additive K-theory means some version of algebraic K-theory in which, according to Spencer Bloch, the general linear group GL has everywhere been replaced by its Lie algebra gl.[1] It is not, therefore, one theory but a way of creating additive or infinitesimal analogues of multiplicative theories.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Additive_K-theory"}
