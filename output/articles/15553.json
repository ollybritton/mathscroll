{"title":"Telescoping series","summary":"In mathematics, a telescoping series is a series whose general term t n {\\displaystyle t_{n}} is of the form t n = a n âˆ’ a n + 1 {\\displaystyle t_{n}=a_{n}-a_{n+1}} , i.e. the difference of two consecutive terms of a sequence ( a n ) {\\displaystyle (a_{n})} .","image":"271566db7e8ca8616a4dc3efb6c5982a2d987ee3.svg","url":"Telescoping_series"}
