{"title":"Tautology (logic)","summary":"In mathematical logic, a tautology (from Greek: ταυτολογία) is a formula or assertion that is true in every possible interpretation. An example is \"x=y or x≠y\". Similarly, \"either the ball is green, or the ball is not green\" is always true, regardless of the colour of the ball.","image":"9510f7d1d521313f9fc7f632c62fd6ec528553d8.svg","url":"Tautology_(logic)"}
