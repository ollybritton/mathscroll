{"title":"Nash equilibrium","summary":"In game theory, the Nash equilibrium, named after the mathematician John Nash, is the most common way to define the solution of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players. In a Nash equilibrium, each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no one has anything to gain by changing only one's own strategy.[1] The principle of Nash equilibrium dates back to the time of Cournot, who in 1838 applied it to competing firms choosing outputs.[2]","image":"de6e810a93f67802ecb603ee0e3324005c6e583e.svg","url":"Nash_equilibrium"}
