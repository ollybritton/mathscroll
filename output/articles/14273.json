{"title":"Sheaf on an algebraic stack","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a quasi-coherent sheaf on an algebraic stack X {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {X}}} is a generalization of a quasi-coherent sheaf on a scheme. The most concrete description is that it is a data that consists of, for each a scheme S in the base category and ξ {\\displaystyle \\xi } in X ( S ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {X}}(S)} , a quasi-coherent sheaf F ξ {\\displaystyle F_{\\xi }} on S together with maps implementing the compatibility conditions among F ξ {\\displaystyle F_{\\xi }} 's.","image":"073868db564a5e806f61f8b2d526ba975cb5c077.svg","url":"Sheaf_on_an_algebraic_stack"}
