{"title":"Method of lines","summary":"The method of lines (MOL, NMOL, NUMOL[1][2][3]) is a technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in which all but one dimension is discretized. By reducing a PDE to a single continuous dimension, the method of lines allows solutions to be computed via methods and software developed for the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and differential-algebraic systems of equations (DAEs). Many integration routines have been developed over the years in many different programming languages, and some have been published as open source resources.[4]","image":"Method_of_lines.gif","url":"Method_of_lines"}
