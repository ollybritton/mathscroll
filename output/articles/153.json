{"title":"Chebyshev polynomials","summary":"The Chebyshev polynomials are two sequences of polynomials related to the cosine and sine functions, notated as T n ( x ) {\\displaystyle T_{n}(x)} and U n ( x ) {\\displaystyle U_{n}(x)} . They can be defined in several equivalent ways, one of which starts with trigonometric functions:","image":"189f6ee3c1d17d5b774aa7d9555947d017c8f43d.svg","url":"A%2fChebyshev_polynomials"}
