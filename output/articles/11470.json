{"title":"Order-2 apeirogonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, an order-2 apeirogonal tiling, apeirogonal dihedron, or infinite dihedron[1] is a tiling of the plane consisting of two apeirogons. It may be considered an improper regular tiling of the Euclidean plane, with Schläfli symbol {∞, 2}. Two apeirogons, joined along all their edges, can completely fill the entire plane as an apeirogon is infinite in size and has an interior angle of 180°, which is half of a full 360°.","image":"Apeirogonal_tiling.svg.png.webp","url":"Order-2_apeirogonal_tiling"}
