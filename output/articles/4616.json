{"title":"Edgeworth series","summary":"The Gram–Charlier A series (named in honor of Jørgen Pedersen Gram and Carl Charlier), and the Edgeworth series (named in honor of Francis Ysidro Edgeworth) are series that approximate a probability distribution in terms of its cumulants.[1] The series are the same; but, the arrangement of terms (and thus the accuracy of truncating the series) differ.[2] The key idea of these expansions is to write the characteristic function of the distribution whose probability density function  f is to be approximated in terms of the characteristic function of a distribution with known and suitable properties, and to recover f through the inverse Fourier transform.","image":"14ce989fd75da938ec6f95a0cdb71037b23a11cb.svg","url":"Edgeworth_series"}
