{"title":"Support (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, the support of a real-valued function f {\\displaystyle f} is the subset of the function domain containing the elements which are not mapped to zero. If the domain of f {\\displaystyle f} is a topological space, then the support of f {\\displaystyle f} is instead defined as the smallest closed set containing all points not mapped to zero. This concept is used very widely in mathematical analysis.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Support_(mathematics)"}
