{"title":"Coordination sequence","summary":"In crystallography and the theory of infinite vertex-transitive graphs, the coordination sequence of a vertex v {\\displaystyle v} is an integer sequence that counts how many vertices are at each possible distance from v {\\displaystyle v} . That is, it is a sequence","image":"e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597.svg","url":"Coordination_sequence"}
