{"title":"Geometric flow","summary":"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a geometric flow, also called a geometric evolution equation, is a type of partial differential equation for a geometric object such as a Riemannian metric or an embedding. It is not a term with a formal meaning, but is typically understood to refer to parabolic partial differential equations.","image":"0efcf5b47104c2ddf893d7608183b766a281cea2.svg","url":"Geometric_flow"}
