{"title":"Small ditrigonal dodecacronic hexecontahedron","summary":"In geometry, the small ditrigonal dodecacronic hexecontahedron (or fat star) is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron. It is the dual of the uniform small ditrigonal dodecicosidodecahedron. It is visually identical to the small dodecicosacron. Its faces are darts. A part of each dart lies inside the solid, hence is invisible in solid models.","image":"DU43_Small_ditrigonal_dodecacronic_hexecontahedron.png.webp","url":"Small_ditrigonal_dodecacronic_hexecontahedron"}
