{"title":"Divisible group","summary":"In mathematics, especially in the field of group theory, a divisible group is an abelian group in which every element can, in some sense, be divided by positive integers, or more  accurately, every element is an nth multiple for each positive integer n.  Divisible groups are important in understanding the structure of abelian groups, especially because they are the injective abelian groups.","image":"ede3320938add8f227928a5efe5738feaa903345.svg","url":"Divisible_group"}
