{"title":"Surface subgroup conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, the surface subgroup conjecture of Friedhelm Waldhausen states that the fundamental group of every closed, irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group has a surface subgroup.  By \"surface subgroup\" we mean the fundamental group of a closed surface not the 2-sphere. This problem is listed as Problem 3.75 in Robion Kirby's problem list.[1]","image":"Jeremy_Kahn_and_Vladimir_Markovic.jpg.webp","url":"Surface_subgroup_conjecture"}
