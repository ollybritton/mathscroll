{"title":"Trochoid","summary":"In geometry, a trochoid (from Greek  trochosÂ 'wheel') is a roulette curve formed by a circle rolling along a line. It is the curve traced out by a point fixed to a circle (where the point may be on, inside, or outside the circle) as it rolls along a straight line.[1] If the point is on the circle, the trochoid is called common (also known as a cycloid); if the point is inside the circle, the trochoid is curtate; and if the point is outside the circle, the trochoid is prolate. The word \"trochoid\" was coined by Gilles de Roberval.","image":"Cycloid_f.gif","url":"Trochoid"}
