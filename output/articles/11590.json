{"title":"Orthogonal array","summary":"In mathematics, an orthogonal array is a \"table\" (array) whose entries come from a fixed finite set of symbols (typically, {1,2,...,n}), arranged in such a way that there is an integer t so that for every selection of t columns of the table, all ordered t-tuples of the symbols, formed by taking the entries in each row restricted to these columns, appear the same number of times. The number t is called the strength of the orthogonal array. Here is a simple example of an orthogonal array with symbol set {1,2} and strength 2:","image":"Orthogonal_Array_OA(18%2C7%2C3%2C2).svg.png.webp","url":"Orthogonal_array"}
