{"title":"Minimum k-cut","summary":"In mathematics, the minimum k-cut is a combinatorial optimization problem that requires finding a set of edges whose removal would partition the graph to at least k connected components. These edges are referred to as k-cut. The goal is to find the minimum-weight k-cut. This partitioning can have applications in VLSI design, data-mining, finite elements and communication in parallel computing.","image":"b20450dd510a0dbb46e6dccb2312b61f7f2dd56f.svg","url":"Minimum_k-cut"}
