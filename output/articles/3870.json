{"title":"Dedekind domain","summary":"In abstract algebra, a Dedekind domain or Dedekind ring, named after Richard Dedekind, is an integral domain in which every nonzero proper ideal factors into a product of prime ideals.  It can be shown that such a factorization is then necessarily unique up to the order of the factors.  There are at least three other characterizations of Dedekind domains that are sometimes taken as the definition: see below.","image":"0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc.svg","url":"Dedekind_domain"}
