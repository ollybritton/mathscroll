{"title":"Baire function","summary":"In mathematics, Baire functions are functions obtained from continuous functions by transfinite iteration of the operation of forming pointwise limits of sequences of functions. They were introduced by Ren√©-Louis Baire in 1899. A Baire set is a set whose characteristic function is a Baire function. (There are other similar, but inequivalent definitions of Baire sets.)","image":"8cafed42588f7e9c90547abb758d0943c0bee7cc.svg","url":"Baire_function"}
