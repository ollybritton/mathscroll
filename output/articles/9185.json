{"title":"Lemniscate elliptic functions","summary":"In mathematics, the lemniscate elliptic functions are elliptic functions related to the arc length of the lemniscate of Bernoulli. They were first studied by Giulio Fagnano in 1718 and later by Leonhard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss, among others.[1]","image":"The_lemniscate_sine_and_lemniscate_cosine_functions_of_a_real_variable.png.webp","url":"Lemniscate_elliptic_functions"}
