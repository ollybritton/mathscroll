{"title":"Tacnode","summary":"In classical algebraic geometry, a tacnode (also called a point of osculation or double cusp)[1] is a kind of singular point of a curve. It is defined as a point where two (or more) osculating circles to the curve at that point are tangent. This means that two branches of the curve have ordinary tangency at the double point.[1]","image":"Tacnode.gif","url":"Tacnode"}
