{"title":"Projection matrix","summary":"In statistics, the projection matrix ( P ) {\\displaystyle (\\mathbf {P} )} ,[1] sometimes also called the influence matrix[2] or hat matrix ( H ) {\\displaystyle (\\mathbf {H} )} , maps the vector of response values (dependent variable values) to the vector of fitted values (or predicted values). It describes the influence each response value has on each fitted value.[3][4] The diagonal elements of the projection matrix are the leverages, which describe the influence each response value has on the fitted value for that same observation.","image":"a9c347f548b86bb76dee71d9ed67c3dfa38749ae.svg","url":"Projection_matrix"}
