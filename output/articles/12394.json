{"title":"Positional notation","summary":"Positional notation (or place-value notation, or positional numeral system) usually denotes the extension to any base of the Hinduâ€“Arabic numeral system (or decimal system). More generally, a positional system is a numeral system in which the contribution of a digit to the value of a number is the value of the digit multiplied by a factor determined by the position of the digit. In early numeral systems, such as Roman numerals, a digit has only one value: I means one, X means ten and C a hundred (however, the value may be negated if placed before another digit).  In modern positional systems, such as the decimal system, the position of the digit means that its value must be multiplied by some value: in 555, the three identical symbols represent five hundreds, five tens, and five units, respectively, due to their different positions in the digit string.","image":"Positional_notation_glossary-en.svg.png.webp","url":"Positional_notation"}
