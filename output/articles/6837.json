{"title":"Hamiltonian Monte Carlo","summary":"The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm (originally known as hybrid Monte Carlo) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for obtaining a sequence of random samples which converge to being distributed according to a target probability distribution for which direct sampling is difficult. This sequence can be used to estimate integrals with respect to the target distribution (expected values).","image":"e41ea95e6949bf4cef6426116364ba87e0fdcd60.svg","url":"Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo"}
