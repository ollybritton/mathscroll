{"title":"Cluster expansion","summary":"In statistical mechanics, the cluster expansion (also called the high temperature expansion or hopping expansion) is a power series expansion of the partition function of a statistical field theory around a model that is a union of non-interacting 0-dimensional field theories. Cluster expansions originated in the work of Mayer & Montroll (1941). Unlike the usual perturbation expansion which usually leads to a divergent asymptotic series, the cluster expansion may converge within a non-trivial region, in particular when the interaction is small and short-ranged.","image":"16821668468713c9a7ad634952bc93b87bdbb907.svg","url":"Cluster_expansion"}
