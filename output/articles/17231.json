{"title":"Łojasiewicz inequality","summary":"In real algebraic geometry, the  Łojasiewicz inequality, named after Stanisław Łojasiewicz, gives an upper bound for the distance of a point to the nearest zero of a given real analytic function.  Specifically, let ƒ : U → R be a real analytic function on an open set U in Rn, and let Z be the zero locus of ƒ. Assume that Z is not empty.  Then for any compact set K in U, there exist positive constants α and C such that, for all  x in K","image":"4ba51d0b81e48b5eadcabe3687ec29ddae47deb9.svg","url":"Łojasiewicz_inequality"}
