{"title":"Iterative learning control","summary":"Iterative Learning Control (ILC) is a method of tracking control for systems that work in a repetitive mode. Examples of systems that operate in a repetitive manner include robot arm manipulators, chemical batch processes and reliability testing rigs. In each of these tasks the system is required to perform the same action over and over again with high precision. This action is represented by the objective of accurately tracking a chosen reference signal r ( t ) {\\displaystyle r(t)} on a finite time interval.","image":"ec653b463c709d42cb85133595bf0da29801f6e5.svg","url":"Iterative_learning_control"}
