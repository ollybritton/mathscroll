{"title":"Rate–distortion theory","summary":"Rate–distortion theory is a major branch of information theory which provides the theoretical foundations for lossy data compression; it addresses the problem of determining the minimal number of bits per symbol, as measured by the rate R, that should be communicated over a channel, so that the source (input signal) can be approximately reconstructed at the receiver (output signal) without exceeding an expected distortion D.","image":"Binaryerasurechannel.png.webp","url":"Rate–distortion_theory"}
