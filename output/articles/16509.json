{"title":"Varadhan's lemma","summary":"In mathematics, Varadhan's lemma is a result from large deviations theory named after S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan.  The result gives information on the asymptotic distribution of a statistic φ(Zε) of a family of random variables Zε as ε becomes small in terms of a rate function for the variables.","image":"2a1fa773e25e0d31746179ca5ff3690fb05527f4.svg","url":"Varadhan's_lemma"}
