{"title":"Bounded quantifier","summary":"In the study of formal theories in mathematical logic, bounded quantifiers (a.k.a. restricted quantifiers) are often included in a formal language in addition to the standard quantifiers \"∀\" and \"∃\". Bounded quantifiers differ from \"∀\" and \"∃\" in that bounded quantifiers restrict the range of the quantified variable. The study of bounded quantifiers is motivated by the fact that determining whether a sentence with only bounded quantifiers is true is often not as difficult as determining whether an arbitrary sentence is true.","image":"a50d69027a781a746b19ab0c81ffe02390c9057c.svg","url":"Bounded_quantifier"}
