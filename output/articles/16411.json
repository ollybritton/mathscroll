{"title":"Unitary divisor","summary":"In mathematics, a natural number a is a unitary divisor (or Hall divisor) of a number b if a is a divisor of b and if a and b a {\\displaystyle {\\frac {b}{a}}} are coprime, having no common factor other than 1. Thus, 5 is a unitary divisor of 60, because 5 and 60 5 = 12 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {60}{5}}=12} have only 1 as a common factor, while 6 is a divisor but not a unitary divisor of 60, as 6 and 60 6 = 10 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {60}{6}}=10} have a common factor other than 1, namely 2. 1 is a unitary divisor of every natural number.","image":"30304b82a801ef33eaf4c0c0306aa6966e83d2f3.svg","url":"Unitary_divisor"}
