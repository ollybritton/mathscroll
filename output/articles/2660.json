{"title":"Circuit rank","summary":"In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, the circuit rank, cyclomatic number, cycle rank, or nullity of an undirected graph is the minimum number of  edges that must be removed from the graph to break all its cycles, making it into a tree or forest. It is equal to the number of independent cycles in the graph (the size of a cycle basis). Unlike the corresponding feedback arc set problem for directed graphs, the circuit rank r is easily computed using the formula","image":"b0badffe3969105b4038dbb791e6d3a4610e6467.svg","url":"Circuit_rank"}
