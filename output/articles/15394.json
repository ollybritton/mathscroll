{"title":"Symmetry group","summary":"In group theory, the symmetry group of a geometric object is the group of all transformations under which the object is invariant, endowed with the group operation of composition. Such a transformation is an invertible mapping of the ambient space which takes the object to itself, and which preserves all the relevant structure of the object. A frequent notation for the symmetry group of an object X is G = Sym(X).","image":"Tetrahedral_group_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Symmetry_group"}
