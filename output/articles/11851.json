{"title":"Particular values of the Riemann zeta function","summary":"In mathematics, the Riemann zeta function is a function in complex analysis, which is also important in number theory. It is often denoted Î¶(s) and is named after the mathematician Bernhard Riemann. When the argument s is a real number greater than one, the zeta function satisfies the equation","image":"31583fbf57898a024d5addcfc8ce3a9e02b3b426.svg","url":"Particular_values_of_the_Riemann_zeta_function"}
