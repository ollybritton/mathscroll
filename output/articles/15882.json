{"title":"Tornado diagram","summary":"Tornado diagrams, also called tornado plots, tornado charts or butterfly charts, are a special type of Bar chart, where the data categories are listed vertically instead of the standard horizontal presentation, and the categories are ordered so that the largest bar appears at the top of the chart, the second largest appears second from the top, and so on.  They are so named because the final chart visually resembles either one half of or a complete tornado.","image":"Tornado_Step_4.1h.png.webp","url":"Tornado_diagram"}
