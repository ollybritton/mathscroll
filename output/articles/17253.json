{"title":"χ-bounded","summary":"In graph theory, a χ {\\displaystyle \\chi } -bounded family F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} of graphs is one for which there is some function f {\\displaystyle f} such that, for every integer t {\\displaystyle t} the graphs in F {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}} with t = ω ( G ) {\\displaystyle t=\\omega (G)} (clique number) can be colored with at most f ( t ) {\\displaystyle f(t)} colors. This concept and its notation were formulated by András Gyárfás.[1] The use of the Greek letter chi in the term χ {\\displaystyle \\chi } -bounded is based on the fact that the chromatic number of a graph G {\\displaystyle G} is commonly denoted χ ( G ) {\\displaystyle \\chi (G)} .","image":"656111758322ace96d80a9371771aa6d3de25437.svg","url":"Χ-bounded"}
