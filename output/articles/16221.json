{"title":"Turing's method","summary":"In mathematics, Turing's method is used to verify that for any given Gram point gm there lie m + 1 zeros of ζ(s), in the region 0 < Im(s) < Im(gm), where ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.[1] It was discovered by Alan Turing and published in 1953,[2] although that proof contained errors and a correction was published in 1970 by R. Sherman Lehman.[3]","image":"30741b9fa96b05a562337a1abe551f8cec385c19.svg","url":"Turing's_method"}
