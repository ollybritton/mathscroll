{"title":"Cubic function","summary":"In mathematics, a cubic function is a function of the form f ( x ) = a x 3 + b x 2 + c x + d , {\\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d,} that is, a polynomial function of degree three. In many texts, the coefficients a, b, c, and d are supposed to be real numbers, and the function is considered as a real function that maps real numbers to real numbers or as a complex function that maps complex numbers to complex numbers. In other cases, the coefficients may be complex numbers, and the function is a complex function that has the set of the complex numbers as its codomain, even when the domain is restricted to the real numbers.","image":"957eb30228dcd428534d339c2ba5f399e93ad49c.svg","url":"Cubic_function"}
