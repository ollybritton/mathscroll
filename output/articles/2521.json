{"title":"Charles Sims (mathematician)","summary":"Charles Coffin Sims (April 14, 1937 – October 23, 2017[1][2]) was an American mathematician best known for his work in group theory.[3] Together with Donald G. Higman he discovered the Higman–Sims group, one of the sporadic groups.  The permutation group software developed by Sims also led to the proof of existence of the Lyons group (also known as the Lyons–Sims group) and the O'Nan group (also known as the O'Nan–Sims group).","image":"Charles_Sims.jpg.webp","url":"Charles_Sims_(mathematician)"}
