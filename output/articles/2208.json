{"title":"Capacitated minimum spanning tree","summary":"Capacitated minimum spanning tree is a minimal cost spanning tree of a graph that has a designated root node r {\\displaystyle r} and satisfies the capacity constraint c {\\displaystyle c} . The capacity constraint ensures that all subtrees (maximal subgraphs connected to the root by a single edge) incident on the root node r {\\displaystyle r} have no more than c {\\displaystyle c} nodes. If the tree nodes have weights, then the capacity constraint may be interpreted as follows: the sum of weights in any subtree should be no greater than c {\\displaystyle c} . The edges connecting the subgraphs to the root node are called gates. Finding the optimal solution is NP-hard.[1]","image":"0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538.svg","url":"Capacitated_minimum_spanning_tree"}
