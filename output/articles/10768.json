{"title":"Multi-compartment model","summary":"A multi-compartment model is a type of mathematical model used for describing the way materials or energies are transmitted among the compartments of a system. Sometimes, the physical system that we try to model in equations is too complex, so it is much easier to discretize the problem and reduce the number of parameters. Each compartment is assumed to be a homogeneous entity within which the entities being modeled are equivalent. A multi-compartment model is classified as a lumped parameters model. Similar to more general mathematical models, multi-compartment models can treat variables as continuous, such as a differential equation, or as discrete, such as a Markov chain. Depending on the system being modeled, they can be treated as stochastic or deterministic.","image":"Singlecell.PNG.webp","url":"Multi-compartment_model"}
