{"title":"Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture","summary":"In theoretical computer science, the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture (also known as the Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture or the evasiveness conjecture) is a group of related conjectures about the number of questions of the form \"Is there an edge between vertex u {\\displaystyle u} and vertex v {\\displaystyle v} ?\" that have to be answered to determine whether or not an undirected graph has a particular property such as planarity or bipartiteness. They are named after Stål Aanderaa, Richard M. Karp, and Arnold L. Rosenberg. According to the conjecture, for a wide class of properties, no algorithm can guarantee that it will be able to skip any questions: any algorithm for determining whether the graph has the property, no matter how clever, might need to examine every pair of vertices before it can give its answer. A property satisfying this conjecture is called evasive.","image":"c3e6bb763d22c20916ed4f0bb6bd49d7470cffd8.svg","url":"Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg_conjecture"}
