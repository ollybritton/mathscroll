{"title":"Cevian","summary":"In geometry, a cevian is a line segment which joins a vertex of a triangle to a point on the opposite side of the triangle.[1][2] Medians and angle bisectors are special cases of cevians. The name \"cevian\" comes from the Italian mathematician Giovanni Ceva, who proved a well-known theorem about cevians which also bears his name.[3]","image":"Stewarts_theorem.svg.png.webp","url":"Cevian"}
