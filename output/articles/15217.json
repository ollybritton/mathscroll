{"title":"Substructure (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematical logic, an (induced) substructure or (induced) subalgebra is a structure whose domain is a subset of that of a bigger structure, and whose functions and relations are restricted to the substructure's domain. Some examples of subalgebras are subgroups, submonoids, subrings, subfields, subalgebras of algebras over a field, or induced subgraphs. Shifting the point of view, the larger structure is called an extension or a superstructure of its substructure.","image":"a924f8dcb2847bb8871edfdbf4c6b5cca0669228.svg","url":"Substructure_(mathematics)"}
