{"title":"Vaidya metric","summary":"In general relativity, the Vaidya metric describes the non-empty external spacetime of a spherically symmetric and nonrotating star which is either emitting or absorbing null dusts. It is named after the Indian physicist Prahalad Chunnilal Vaidya and constitutes the simplest non-static generalization of the non-radiative Schwarzschild solution to Einstein's field equation, and therefore is also called the \"radiating(shining) Schwarzschild metric\".","image":"Spacetime_lattice_analogy.svg.png.webp","url":"Vaidya_metric"}
