{"title":"Acoustic metric","summary":"In mathematical physics, a metric describes the arrangement of relative distances within a surface or volume, usually measured by signals passing through the region â€“ essentially describing the intrinsic geometry of the region. An acoustic metric will describe the signal-carrying properties characteristic of a given particulate medium in acoustics, or in fluid dynamics. Other descriptive names such as sonic metric are also sometimes used, interchangeably.","image":"85820588abd7333ef4d0c56539cb31c20e730753.svg","url":"Acoustic_metric"}
