{"title":"Bijection","summary":"In mathematics, a bijection, also known as a bijective function, one-to-one correspondence, or invertible function, is a function between the elements of two sets, where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set; there are no unpaired elements between the two sets. In mathematical terms, a bijective function f: X â†’ Y is a one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective) mapping of a set X to a set Y.[1] The term one-to-one correspondence must not be confused with one-to-one function (an injective function; see figures).","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Bijection"}
