{"title":"Regular number","summary":"Regular numbers are numbers that evenly divide powers of 60 (or, equivalently, powers of 30).  Equivalently, they are the numbers whose only prime divisors are 2, 3, and 5. As an example, 602 = 3600 = 48 × 75, so as divisors of a power of 60 both 48 and 75 are regular.","image":"Regular_divisibility_lattice.svg.png.webp","url":"Regular_number"}
