{"title":"Tomahawk (geometry)","summary":"The tomahawk is a tool in geometry for angle trisection, the problem of splitting an angle into three equal parts. The boundaries of its shape include a semicircle and two line segments, arranged in a way that resembles a tomahawk, a Native American axe.[1][2] The same tool has also been called the shoemaker's knife,[3] but that name is more commonly used in geometry to refer to a different shape, the arbelos (a curvilinear triangle bounded by three mutually tangent semicircles).[4]","image":"Tomahawk_filled.svg.png.webp","url":"Tomahawk_(geometry)"}
