{"title":"Grinberg's theorem","summary":"In graph theory, Grinberg's theorem is a necessary condition for a planar graph to contain a Hamiltonian cycle, based on the lengths of its face cycles. If a graph does not meet this condition, it is not Hamiltonian. The result has been widely used to prove that certain planar graphs constructed to have additional properties are not Hamiltonian; for instance it can prove non-Hamiltonicity of some counterexamples to Tait's conjecture that cubic polyhedral graphs are Hamiltonian.","image":"Grinberg_5CEC_Nonhamiltonian_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Grinberg's_theorem"}
