{"title":"Representation theory of SU(2)","summary":"In the study of the representation theory  of Lie groups, the study of representations of SU(2) is fundamental to the study of representations of semisimple Lie groups. It is the first case of a Lie group that is both a compact group and a non-abelian group. The first condition implies the representation theory is discrete: representations are direct sums of a collection of basic irreducible representations (governed by the Peterâ€“Weyl theorem). The second means that there will be irreducible representations in dimensions greater than 1.","image":"0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc.svg","url":"Representation_theory_of_SU(2)"}
