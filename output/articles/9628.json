{"title":"Locally compact group","summary":"In mathematics, a locally compact group is a topological group G for which the underlying topology is locally compact and Hausdorff. Locally compact groups are important because many examples of groups that arise throughout mathematics are locally compact and such groups have a natural measure called the Haar measure. This allows one to define integrals of Borel measurable functions on G so that standard analysis notions such as the Fourier transform and L p {\\displaystyle L^{p}} spaces can be generalized.","image":"cf2317aaca1ecee4b8ccf667bc1001059eae5850.svg","url":"Locally_compact_group"}
