{"title":"Regular element of a Lie algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a regular element of a Lie algebra or Lie group is an element whose centralizer has dimension as small as possible. For example, in a complex semisimple Lie algebra, an element X ∈ g {\\displaystyle X\\in {\\mathfrak {g}}} is regular if its centralizer in g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} has dimension equal to the rank of g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} , which in turn equals the dimension of some Cartan subalgebra h {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {h}}} (note that in earlier papers, an element of a complex semisimple Lie algebra was termed regular if it is semisimple and the kernel of its adjoint representation is a Cartan subalgebra). An element g ∈ G {\\displaystyle g\\in G} a Lie group is regular if its centralizer has dimension equal to the rank of G {\\displaystyle G} .","image":"db578a65a37022dc84959dfc2a19f694ef4b46a7.svg","url":"Regular_element_of_a_Lie_algebra"}
