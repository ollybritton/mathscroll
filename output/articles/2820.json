{"title":"Codd's cellular automaton","summary":"Codd's cellular automaton is a cellular automaton (CA) devised by the British computer scientist Edgar F. Codd in 1968. It was designed to recreate the computation- and construction-universality of von Neumann's CA but with fewer states: 8 instead of 29. Codd showed that it was possible to make a self-reproducing machine in his CA, in a similar way to von Neumann's universal constructor, but never gave a complete implementation.","image":"Codd_CA_RepeaterEmitter.gif","url":"Codd's_cellular_automaton"}
