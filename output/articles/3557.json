{"title":"Critical three-state Potts model","summary":"The three-state Potts CFT, also known as the Z 3 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} _{3}} parafermion CFT, is a conformal field theory in two dimensions. It is a minimal model with central charge c = 4 / 5 {\\displaystyle c=4/5} . It is considered to be the simplest minimal model with a non-diagonal partition function in Virasoro characters, as well as the simplest non-trivial CFT with the W-algebra as a symmetry.[1][2][3]","image":"1a5bb50b04d35fa08317c86cee60d88729c80ffa.svg","url":"Critical_three-state_Potts_model"}
