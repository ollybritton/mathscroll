{"title":"Osgood's lemma","summary":"In mathematics, Osgood's lemma, introduced by William Fogg OsgoodÂ (1899), is a proposition in complex analysis.  It states that a continuous function of several complex variables that is holomorphic in each variable separately is holomorphic. The assumption that the function is continuous can be dropped, but that form of the lemma is much harder to prove and is known as Hartogs' theorem.","image":"306c097f43c91dce633d12cde024948d39e73752.svg","url":"Osgood's_lemma"}
