{"title":"Ahlswede–Daykin inequality","summary":"The Ahlswede–Daykin inequality  (Ahlswede & Daykin 1978), also known as the four functions theorem (or inequality), is a correlation-type inequality for four functions on a finite distributive lattice. It is a fundamental tool in statistical mechanics and probabilistic combinatorics (especially random graphs and the probabilistic method).","image":"1cea283febb12a95f12441959bda1e29844d2eef.svg","url":"Ahlswede–Daykin_inequality"}
