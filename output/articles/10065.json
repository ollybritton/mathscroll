{"title":"Mathematical chess problem","summary":"A mathematical chess problem is a mathematical problem which is formulated using a chessboard and chess pieces. These problems belong to recreational mathematics. The most well-known problems of this kind are the eight queens puzzle and the knight's tour problem, which have connection to graph theory and combinatorics. Many famous mathematicians studied mathematical chess problems, such as, Thabit, Euler, Legendre and Gauss.[1] Besides finding a solution to a particular problem, mathematicians are usually interested in counting the total number of possible solutions, finding solutions with certain properties, as well as generalization of the problems to N×N or M×N boards.","image":"Chessboard480.svg.png.webp","url":"Mathematical_chess_problem"}
