{"title":"Spectral element method","summary":"In the numerical solution of partial differential equations, a topic in mathematics, the spectral element method (SEM) is a formulation of the finite element method (FEM) that uses high degree piecewise polynomials as basis functions. The spectral element method was introduced in a 1984 paper[1] by A. T. Patera. Although Patera is credited with development of the method, his work was a rediscovery of an existing method (see Development History)","image":"2352f79f73ea92b82f762f072e41bb4a4cef2395.svg","url":"Spectral_element_method"}
