{"title":"Main diagonal","summary":"In linear algebra, the main diagonal (sometimes principal diagonal, primary diagonal, leading diagonal, major diagonal, or good diagonal) of a matrix A {\\displaystyle A} is the list of entries a i , j {\\displaystyle a_{i,j}} where i = j {\\displaystyle i=j} . All off-diagonal elements are zero in a diagonal matrix. The following four matrices have their main diagonals indicated by red ones:","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Main_diagonal"}
