{"title":"Ring homomorphism","summary":"In ring theory, a branch of abstract algebra, a ring homomorphism is a structure-preserving function between two rings. More explicitly, if R and S are rings, then a ring homomorphism is a function f : R → S such that f is:[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][lower-alpha 1]","image":"822600027fb446b01dd1902d7d3864d9f0f905ba.svg","url":"Ring_homomorphism"}
