{"title":"Continuous function","summary":"In mathematics, a continuous function is a function such that a continuous variation (that is a change without jump) of the argument induces a continuous variation of the value of the function. This means that there are no abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities. More precisely, a function is continuous if arbitrarily small changes in its value can be assured by restricting to sufficiently small changes of its argument. A discontinuous function is a function that is not continuous. Up until the 19th century, mathematicians largely relied on intuitive notions of continuity, and considered only continuous functions. The epsilonâ€“delta definition of a limit was introduced to formalize the definition of continuity.","image":"2311a6a75c54b0ea085a381ba472c31d59321514.svg","url":"Continuous_function"}
