{"title":"Standard part function","summary":"In nonstandard analysis, the standard part function is a function from the limited (finite) hyperreal numbers to the real numbers.  Briefly, the standard part function \"rounds off\" a finite hyperreal to the nearest real.  It associates to every such hyperreal x {\\displaystyle x} , the unique real x 0 {\\displaystyle x_{0}} infinitely close to it, i.e. x âˆ’ x 0 {\\displaystyle x-x_{0}} is infinitesimal.  As such, it is a mathematical implementation of the historical concept of adequality introduced by Pierre de Fermat,[1] as well as Leibniz's Transcendental law of homogeneity.","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Standard_part_function"}
