{"title":"Real projective line","summary":"In geometry, a real projective line is a projective line over the real numbers. It is an extension of the usual concept of a line that has been historically introduced to solve a problem set by visual perspective: two parallel lines do not intersect but seem to intersect \"at infinity\". For solving this problem, points at infinity have been introduced, in such a way that in a real projective plane, two distinct projective lines meet in exactly one point.  The set of these points at infinity, the \"horizon\" of the visual perspective in the plane, is a real projective line.  It is the set of directions emanating from an observer situated at any point, with opposite directions identified.","image":"Real_projective_line.svg.png.webp","url":"Real_projective_line"}
