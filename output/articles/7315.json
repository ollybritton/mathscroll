{"title":"Hochschild homology","summary":"In mathematics, Hochschild homology (and cohomology) is a homology theory for associative algebras over rings. There is also a theory for Hochschild homology of certain functors. Hochschild cohomology was introduced by Gerhard Hochschild (1945) for algebras over a field, and extended to algebras over more general rings by Henri Cartan and Samuel Eilenberg (1956).","image":"da731c588129f73a8ff202ef03ec5a3bbd9f0a92.svg","url":"Hochschild_homology"}
