{"title":"Proof compression","summary":"In proof theory, an area of mathematical logic, proof compression is the problem of algorithmically compressing formal proofs. The developed algorithms can be used to improve the proofs generated by automated theorem proving tools such as SAT solvers, SMT-solvers, first-order theorem provers and proof assistants.","image":"54ddec2e922c5caea4e47d04feef86e782dc8e6d.svg","url":"Proof_compression"}
