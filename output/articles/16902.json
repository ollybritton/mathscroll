{"title":"Wiener amalgam space","summary":"In mathematics, amalgam spaces categorize functions with regard to their local and global behavior.  While the concept of function spaces treating local and global behavior separately was already known earlier, Wiener amalgams, as the term is used today, were introduced by Hans Georg Feichtinger in 1980.  The concept is named after Norbert Wiener.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Wiener_amalgam_space"}
