{"title":"Split-octonion","summary":"In mathematics, the split-octonions are an 8-dimensional nonassociative algebra over the real numbers. Unlike the standard octonions, they contain non-zero elements which are non-invertible.  Also the signatures of their quadratic forms differ: the split-octonions have a split signature (4,4) whereas the octonions have a positive-definite signature (8,0).","image":"b514e51b5b1c78d4c6a71b82e90da1523706715d.svg","url":"Split-octonion"}
