{"title":"Spectrum (topology)","summary":"In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, a spectrum is an object representing a generalized cohomology theory. Every such cohomology theory is representable, as follows from Brown's representability theorem. This means that, given a cohomology theory","image":"8300b06a7cf3d185ac0f10c6dcfea8d7c302b86b.svg","url":"Spectrum_(topology)"}
