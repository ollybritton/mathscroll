{"title":"Commutative algebra","summary":"Commutative algebra, first known as ideal theory, is the branch of algebra that studies commutative rings, their ideals, and modules over such rings. Both algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory build on commutative algebra. Prominent examples of commutative rings include polynomial rings; rings of algebraic integers, including the ordinary integers Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} } ; and p-adic integers.[1]","image":"449494a083e0a1fda2b61c62b2f09b6bee4633dc.svg","url":"Commutative_algebra"}
