{"title":"Furstenberg's proof of the infinitude of primes","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in number theory, Hillel Furstenberg's proof of the infinitude of primes is a topological proof that the integers contain infinitely many prime numbers.  When examined closely, the proof is less a statement about topology than a statement about certain properties of arithmetic sequences.[1][2]  Unlike Euclid's classical proof, Furstenberg's proof is a proof by contradiction.  The proof was published in 1955 in the American Mathematical Monthly while Furstenberg was still an undergraduate student at Yeshiva University.","image":"449494a083e0a1fda2b61c62b2f09b6bee4633dc.svg","url":"Furstenberg's_proof_of_the_infinitude_of_primes"}
