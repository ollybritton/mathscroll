{"title":"Complex projective space","summary":"In mathematics, complex projective space is the projective space with respect to the field of complex numbers.  By analogy, whereas the points of a real projective space label the lines through the origin of a real Euclidean space, the points of a complex projective space label the complex lines through the origin of a complex Euclidean space (see below for an intuitive account).  Formally, a complex projective space is the space of complex lines through the origin of an (n+1)-dimensional complex vector space.  The space is denoted variously as P(Cn+1), Pn(C) or CPn.  When n = 1, the complex projective space CP1 is the Riemann sphere, and when n = 2, CP2 is the complex projective plane (see there for a more elementary discussion).","image":"Stereographic_projection_in_3D.svg.png.webp","url":"Complex_projective_space"}
