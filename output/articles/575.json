{"title":"Algebra representation","summary":"In abstract algebra, a representation of an associative algebra is a module for that algebra. Here an associative algebra is a (not necessarily unital) ring. If the algebra is not unital, it may be made so in a standard way (see the adjoint functors page); there is no essential difference between modules for the resulting unital ring, in which the identity acts by the identity mapping, and representations of the algebra.","image":"1eea0bc4d153e53f51a2c1bedb5f885d7da23a9a.svg","url":"Algebra_representation"}
