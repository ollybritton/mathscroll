{"title":"Singapore math","summary":"Singapore math (or Singapore maths in British English[1]) is a teaching method based on the national mathematics curriculum used for first through sixth grade in Singaporean schools.[2][3] The term was coined in the United States[4] to describe an approach originally developed in Singapore to teach students to learn and master fewer mathematical concepts at greater detail as well as having them learn these concepts using a three-step learning process: concrete, pictorial, and abstract.[2][3] In the concrete step, students engage in hands-on learning experiences using physical objects which can be everyday items such as paper clips, toy blocks or math manipulates such as counting bears, link cubes and fraction discs.[5] This is followed by drawing pictorial representations of mathematical concepts. Students then solve mathematical problems in an abstract way by using numbers and symbols.[6]","image":"Whole-part_model_addition_70_plus_30.jpg.webp","url":"Singapore_math"}
