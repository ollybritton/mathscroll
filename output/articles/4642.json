{"title":"Edwin Bidwell Wilson","summary":"Edwin Bidwell Wilson (April 25, 1879 – December 28, 1964) was an American mathematician, statistician, physicist and general polymath.[1]  He was the sole protégé of Yale University physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs and was mentor to MIT economist Paul Samuelson.[2]  Wilson had a distinguished academic career at Yale and MIT, followed by a long and distinguished period of service as a civilian employee of the US Navy in the Office of Naval Research.  In his latter role, he was awarded the Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the highest honorary award available to a civilian employee of the US Navy.  Wilson made broad contributions to mathematics, statistics and aeronautics, and is well-known for producing a number of widely used textbooks.  He is perhaps best known for his derivation of the eponymously named Wilson score interval, which is a confidence interval used widely in statistics.","image":"Wilson-2.jpg.webp","url":"Edwin_Bidwell_Wilson"}
