{"title":"Fireworks algorithm","summary":"The Fireworks Algorithm (FWA) is a swarm intelligence algorithm that explores a very large solution space by choosing a set of random points confined by some distance metric in the hopes that one or more of them will yield promising results, allowing for a more concentrated search nearby.","image":"5db47cb3d2f9496205a17a6856c91c1d3d363ccd.svg","url":"Fireworks_algorithm"}
