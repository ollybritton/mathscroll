{"title":"Time domain","summary":"Time domain refers to the analysis of mathematical functions, physical signals or time series of economic or environmental data, with respect to time.  In the time domain, the signal or function's value is known for all real numbers, for the case of continuous time, or at various separate instants in the case of discrete time. An oscilloscope is a tool commonly used to visualize real-world signals in the time domain.  A time-domain graph shows how a signal changes with time, whereas a frequency-domain graph shows how much of the signal lies within each given frequency band over a range of frequencies.","image":"Fourier_transform_time_and_frequency_domains_(small).gif","url":"Time_domain"}
