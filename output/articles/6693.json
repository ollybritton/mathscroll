{"title":"Gyroelongated pentagonal cupola","summary":"In geometry, the gyroelongated pentagonal cupola is one of the Johnson solids (J24). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a pentagonal cupola (J5) by attaching a decagonal antiprism to its base. It can also be seen as a gyroelongated pentagonal bicupola (J46) with one pentagonal cupola removed.","image":"Gyroelongated_pentagonal_cupola.png.webp","url":"Gyroelongated_pentagonal_cupola"}
