{"title":"3-3 duoprism","summary":"In the geometry of 4 dimensions, the 3-3 duoprism or triangular duoprism is a four-dimensional convex polytope. It can be constructed as the Cartesian product of two triangles and is the simplest of an infinite family of four-dimensional polytopes constructed as Cartesian products of two polygons, the duoprisms.","image":"3-3_duoprism.png.webp","url":"3-3_duoprism"}
