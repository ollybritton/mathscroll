{"title":"Ribbon (mathematics)","summary":"In differential geometry, a ribbon (or strip) is the combination of a smooth space curve and its corresponding normal vector. More formally, a ribbon denoted by ( X , U ) {\\displaystyle (X,U)} includes a curve X {\\displaystyle X} given by a three-dimensional vector X ( s ) {\\displaystyle X(s)} , depending continuously on the curve arc-length s {\\displaystyle s} ( a ≤ s ≤ b {\\displaystyle a\\leq s\\leq b} ), and a unit vector U ( s ) {\\displaystyle U(s)} perpendicular to X {\\displaystyle X} at each point.[1] Ribbons have seen particular application as regards DNA.[2]","image":"5b12bcfdb2fa7465cf7e059ba8cb9f165793c7bc.svg","url":"Ribbon_(mathematics)"}
