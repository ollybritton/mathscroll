{"title":"Integrable module","summary":"In algebra, an integrable module (or integrable representation) of a Kac–Moody algebra g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} (a certain infinite-dimensional Lie algebra) is a representation of g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} such that (1) it is a sum of weight spaces and (2) the Chevalley generators e i , f i {\\displaystyle e_{i},f_{i}} of g {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {g}}} are locally nilpotent.[1] For example, the adjoint representation of a Kac–Moody algebra is integrable.[2]","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Integrable_module"}
