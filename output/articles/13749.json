{"title":"Routhian mechanics","summary":"In classical mechanics, Routh's procedure or Routhian mechanics is a hybrid formulation of Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics developed by Edward John Routh. Correspondingly, the Routhian is the function which replaces both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions. Routhian mechanics is equivalent to Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics, and introduces no new physics. It offers an alternative way to solve mechanical problems.","image":"Edward_J_Routh.jpg.webp","url":"Routhian_mechanics"}
