{"title":"Mice problem","summary":"In mathematics, the mice problem is a continuous pursuitâ€“evasion problem in which a number of mice (or insects, dogs, missiles, etc.) are considered to be placed at the corners of a regular polygon. In the classic setup, each then begins to move towards its immediate neighbour (clockwise or anticlockwise). The goal is often to find out at what time the mice meet.","image":"Four_point_pursuit_curve.gif","url":"Mice_problem"}
