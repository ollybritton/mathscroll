{"title":"h topology","summary":"In algebraic geometry, the h topology is a Grothendieck topology introduced by Vladimir Voevodsky to study the homology of schemes.[1][2]  It combines several good properties possessed by its related \"sub\"topologies, such as the qfh and cdh topologies. It has subsequently been used by Beilinson to study p-adic Hodge theory, in Bhatt and Scholze's work on projectivity of the affine Grassmanian, Huber and JÃ¶rder's study of differential forms, etc.","image":"9c7976bd946abf4384ee93463d30fe403c8b5b49.svg","url":"H_topology"}
