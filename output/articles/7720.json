{"title":"Indeterminate equation","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in algebra, an indeterminate equation is an equation for which there is more than one solution.[1] For example, the equation a x + b y = c {\\displaystyle ax+by=c} is a simple indeterminate equation, as is x 2 = 1 {\\displaystyle x^{2}=1} . Indeterminate equations cannot be solved uniquely. In fact, in some cases it might even have infinitely many solutions.[2] Some of the prominent examples of indeterminate equations include:","image":"2a39c048e6c827a005e417be0e1bd5ac314e6fcc.svg","url":"Indeterminate_equation"}
