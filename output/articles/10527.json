{"title":"Mirabolic group","summary":"In mathematics, a mirabolic subgroup of the general linear group GLn(k) is  a subgroup consisting of automorphisms fixing a given non-zero vector in kn. Mirabolic subgroups were introduced by (Gelfand & Kajdan 1975). The image of a mirabolic subgroup in the projective general linear group is a parabolic subgroup consisting of all elements fixing a given point of projective space. The word \"mirabolic\" is a portmanteau of  \"miraculous parabolic\". As an algebraic group, a mirabolic subgroup is the semidirect product of a vector space with its group of automorphisms, and such groups are called mirabolic groups. The mirabolic subgroup is used to define the Kirillov model of a representation of the general linear group.","image":"f6ca1e107a0563331fe8bfaf1c84744b1a1e6769.svg","url":"Mirabolic_group"}
