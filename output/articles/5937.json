{"title":"Galois module","summary":"In mathematics, a Galois module is a G-module, with G being the Galois group of some extension of fields. The term Galois representation is frequently used when the G-module is a vector space over a field or a free module over a ring in representation theory, but can also be used as a synonym for G-module. The study of Galois modules for extensions of local or global fields and their group cohomology is an important tool in number theory.","image":"ae15536df3d054328f6b692216d37016cb472dfe.svg","url":"Galois_module"}
