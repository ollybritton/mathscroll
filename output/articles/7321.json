{"title":"Hodge index theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Hodge index theorem for an algebraic surface V determines the signature of the intersection pairing on the algebraic curves C on V. It says, roughly speaking, that the space spanned by such curves (up to linear equivalence) has a one-dimensional subspace on which it is positive definite (not uniquely determined), and decomposes as a direct sum of some such one-dimensional subspace, and a complementary subspace on which it is negative definite.","image":"bc0c6fdad773f971b6088fb18a7efc4f3d31cc4c.svg","url":"Hodge_index_theorem"}
