{"title":"Siegel zero","summary":"In mathematics, more specifically in the field of analytic number theory, a Landauâ€“Siegel zero or simply Siegel zero (also known as exceptional zero[1]), named after Edmund Landau and Carl Ludwig Siegel, is a type of potential counterexample to the generalized Riemann hypothesis, on the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions associated to quadratic number fields. Roughly speaking, these are possible zeros very near (in a quantifiable sense) to s = 1 {\\displaystyle s=1} .","image":"bac386d8f227fb823cede9b3e33d706cad3ed306.svg","url":"Siegel_zero"}
