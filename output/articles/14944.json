{"title":"Star height","summary":"In theoretical computer science, more precisely in the theory of formal languages, the star height is a measure for the structural complexity of regular expressions and regular languages. The star height of a regular expression equals the maximum nesting depth of stars appearing in that expression. The star height of a regular language is the least star height of any regular expression for that language. The concept of star height was first defined and studied by Eggan (1963).","image":"acdcbadbe9c1ef4242dd5bdab2da2877edd5c2de.svg","url":"Star_height"}
