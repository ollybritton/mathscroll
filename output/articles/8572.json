{"title":"Kan fibration","summary":"In mathematics, Kan complexes and Kan fibrations are part of the theory of simplicial sets. Kan fibrations are the fibrations of the standard model category structure on simplicial sets and are therefore of fundamental importance. Kan complexes are the fibrant objects in this model category. The name is in honor of Daniel Kan.","image":"2dKanFibration.svg.png.webp","url":"Kan_fibration"}
