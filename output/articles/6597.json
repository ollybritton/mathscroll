{"title":"Gross–Koblitz formula","summary":"In mathematics, the Gross–Koblitz formula, introduced by Gross and  Koblitz (1979) expresses a Gauss sum using a product of values of the p-adic gamma function. It is an analog of the Chowla–Selberg formula for the usual gamma function. It implies the Hasse–Davenport relation and generalizes the Stickelberger theorem. Boyarsky (1980) gave another proof of the Gross–Koblitz formula (Boyarski being a pseudonym of Bernard Dwork), and Robert (2001) gave an elementary proof.","image":"ea37ab19b8c6678586b11b01d8b0a917cf55e843.svg","url":"Gross–Koblitz_formula"}
