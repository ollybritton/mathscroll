{"title":"Sanov's theorem","summary":"In mathematics and information theory, Sanov's theorem gives a bound on the probability of observing an atypical sequence of samples from a given probability distribution. In the language of large deviations theory, Sanov's theorem identifies the rate function for large deviations of the empirical measure of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables.","image":"68ea9224b8b04e639bb8f71b883774e5c2899736.svg","url":"Sanov's_theorem"}
