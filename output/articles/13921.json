{"title":"Scale (descriptive set theory)","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of descriptive set theory, a scale is a certain kind of object defined on a set of points in some Polish space (for example, a scale might be defined on a set of real numbers).  Scales were originally isolated as a concept in the theory of uniformization,[1] but have found wide applicability in descriptive set theory, with applications such as establishing bounds on the possible lengths of wellorderings of a given complexity, and showing (under certain assumptions) that there are largest countable sets of certain complexities.","image":"84deabb61fbad2a510b25fd0f6889eeb828edaca.svg","url":"Scale_(descriptive_set_theory)"}
