{"title":"Separable partial differential equation","summary":"A separable partial differential equation is one that can be broken into a set of separate equations of lower dimensionality (fewer independent variables) by a method of separation of variables.  This generally relies upon the problem having some special form or symmetry.  In this way, the partial differential equation (PDE) can be solved by solving a set of simpler PDEs, or even ordinary differential equations (ODEs) if the problem can be broken down into one-dimensional equations.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Separable_partial_differential_equation"}
