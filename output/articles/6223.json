{"title":"Germ (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, the notion of a germ of an object in/on a topological space is an equivalence class of that object and others of the same kind that captures their shared local properties. In particular, the objects in question are mostly functions (or maps) and subsets. In specific implementations of this idea, the functions or subsets in question will have some property, such as being analytic or smooth, but in general this is not needed (the functions in question need not even be continuous); it is however necessary that the space on/in which the object is defined is a topological space, in order that the word local has some meaning.","image":"a2979ff5d39cd2f0db5eda37f7ec54baae4c9909.svg","url":"Germ_(mathematics)"}
