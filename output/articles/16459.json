{"title":"Upper half-plane","summary":"In mathematics, the upper half-plane, H , {\\displaystyle \\,{\\mathcal {H}}\\,,} is the set of points (x, y) in the Cartesian plane with y > 0. The lower half-space is defined similarly, by requiring that y be negative instead.","image":"9fbf8359f62052975fc4c2ebed2252f1a8201e89.svg","url":"Upper_half-plane"}
