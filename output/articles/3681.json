{"title":"Cycle per second","summary":"The cycle per second is a once-common English name for the unit of frequency now known as the hertz (Hz). Cycles per second may be denoted by c.p.s., c/s, or, ambiguously, just \"cycles\" (Cyc., Cy., C, or c). The term comes from repetitive phenomena such as sound waves having a frequency measurable as a number of oscillations, or cycles, per second.[1]","image":"Octal_base_crystal.jpg.webp","url":"Cycle_per_second"}
