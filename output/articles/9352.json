{"title":"Linear complementarity problem","summary":"In mathematical optimization theory, the linear complementarity problem (LCP) arises frequently in computational mechanics and encompasses the well-known quadratic programming as a special case. It was proposed by Cottle and Dantzig inÂ 1968.[1][2][3]","image":"a404f64c68cbd7f4e57cb6c8889c4772341af8c5.svg","url":"Linear_complementarity_problem"}
