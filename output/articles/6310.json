{"title":"Global optimization","summary":"Global optimization is a branch of applied mathematics and numerical analysis that attempts to find the global minima or maxima of a function or a set of functions on a given set. It is usually described as a minimization problem because the maximization of the real-valued function g ( x ) {\\displaystyle g(x)} is equivalent to the minimization of the function f ( x ) := ( − 1 ) ⋅ g ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x):=(-1)\\cdot g(x)} .","image":"c6ca91363022bd5e4dcb17e5ef29f78b8ef00b59.svg","url":"Global_optimization"}
