{"title":"Conductor of an abelian variety","summary":"In mathematics, in Diophantine geometry, the conductor of an abelian variety defined over a local or global field F is a measure of how \"bad\" the bad reduction at some prime is.  It is connected to the ramification in the field generated by the torsion points.","image":"403fd936025b78a33b53110e601a1d9131561528.svg","url":"Conductor_of_an_abelian_variety"}
