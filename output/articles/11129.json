{"title":"Nodal surface","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a nodal surface is a surface in (usually complex) projective space whose only singularities are nodes. A major problem about them is to find the maximum number of nodes of a nodal surface of given degree.","image":"fb818c13790c8dda4eed3366fb2694c22d94a001.svg","url":"Nodal_surface"}
