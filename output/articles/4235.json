{"title":"Discontinuous linear map","summary":"In mathematics, linear maps form an important class of \"simple\" functions which preserve the algebraic structure of linear spaces and are often used as approximations to more general functions (see linear approximation).  If the spaces involved are also topological spaces (that is, topological vector spaces), then it makes sense to ask whether all linear maps are continuous. It turns out that for maps defined on infinite-dimensional topological vector spaces (e.g., infinite-dimensional normed spaces), the answer is generally no: there exist discontinuous linear maps.  If the domain of definition is complete, it is trickier; such maps can be proven to exist, but the proof relies on the axiom of choice and does not provide an explicit example.","image":"abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c.svg","url":"Discontinuous_linear_map"}
