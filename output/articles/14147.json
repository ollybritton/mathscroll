{"title":"Semisimple algebra","summary":"In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, a semisimple algebra is an associative artinian algebra over a field which has trivial Jacobson radical (only the zero element of the algebra is in the Jacobson radical). If the algebra is finite-dimensional this is equivalent to saying that it can be expressed as a Cartesian product of simple subalgebras.","image":"97698a4fa3192fe5d7eb86f74d1b6e8bbb29e8d3.svg","url":"Semisimple_algebra"}
