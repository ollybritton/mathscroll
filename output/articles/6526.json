{"title":"Great grand stellated 120-cell","summary":"In geometry, the great grand stellated 120-cell or great grand stellated polydodecahedron is a regular star 4-polytope with Schläfli symbol {5/2,3,3}, one of 10 regular Schläfli-Hess 4-polytopes. It is unique among the 10 for having 600 vertices, and has the same vertex arrangement as the regular convex 120-cell.","image":"Ortho_solid_016-uniform_polychoron_p33-t0.png.webp","url":"Great_grand_stellated_120-cell"}
