{"title":"Cauchy's integral formula","summary":"In mathematics, Cauchy's integral formula, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a central statement in complex analysis. It expresses the fact that a holomorphic function defined on a disk is completely determined by its values on the boundary of the disk, and it provides integral formulas for all derivatives of a holomorphic function. Cauchy's formula shows that, in complex analysis, \"differentiation is equivalent to integration\": complex differentiation, like integration, behaves well under uniform limits â€“ a result that does not hold in real analysis.","image":"Gamma_abs_3D.png.webp","url":"Cauchy's_integral_formula"}
