{"title":"Trakhtenbrot's theorem","summary":"In logic, finite model theory, and computability theory, Trakhtenbrot's theorem (due to Boris Trakhtenbrot) states that the problem of validity in first-order logic  on the class of all finite models is undecidable.  In fact, the class of valid sentences over finite models is not recursively enumerable (though it is co-recursively enumerable).","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Trakhtenbrot's_theorem"}
