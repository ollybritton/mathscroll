{"title":"Angles","summary":"The Angles (Old English: Ængle, Engle; Latin: Angli) were one of the main Germanic peoples[2] who settled in Great Britain in the post-Roman period. They founded several kingdoms of the Heptarchy in Anglo-Saxon England. Their name is the root of the name England (\"land of Ængle\"). According to Tacitus, writing around 100 AD, a people known as Angles (Anglii) lived east of the Lombards and Semnones, who lived near the Elbe river.[3]","image":"Anglo-Saxon_Homelands_and_Settlements.svg.png.webp","url":"Angles"}
