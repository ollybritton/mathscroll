{"title":"Order dual (functional analysis)","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, the order dual of an ordered vector space X {\\displaystyle X} is the set Pos ⁡ ( X ∗ ) − Pos ⁡ ( X ∗ ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Pos} \\left(X^{*}\\right)-\\operatorname {Pos} \\left(X^{*}\\right)} where Pos ⁡ ( X ∗ ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Pos} \\left(X^{*}\\right)} denotes the set of all positive linear functionals on X {\\displaystyle X} , where a linear function f {\\displaystyle f} on X {\\displaystyle X} is called positive if for all x ∈ X , {\\displaystyle x\\in X,} x ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle x\\geq 0} implies f ( x ) ≥ 0. {\\displaystyle f(x)\\geq 0.} [1] The order dual of X {\\displaystyle X} is denoted by X + {\\displaystyle X^{+}} . Along with the related concept of the order bound dual, this space plays an important role in the theory of ordered topological vector spaces.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Order_dual_(functional_analysis)"}
