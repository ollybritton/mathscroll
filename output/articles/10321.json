{"title":"Mereology","summary":"In logic, philosophy and related fields, mereology (from Greek  μέρος 'part' (root: μερε-, mere-, 'part') and the suffix -logy, 'study, discussion, science') is the study of parts and the wholes they form.  Whereas set theory is founded on the membership relation between a set and its elements, mereology emphasizes the meronomic relation between entities, which—from a set-theoretic perspective—is closer to the concept of inclusion between sets.","image":"8d5ec755b59a63e6147ca7ea6e1da453599d0c07.svg","url":"Mereology"}
