{"title":"Paramodular group","summary":"In mathematics, a paramodular group is a special sort of arithmetic subgroup of the symplectic group. It is a generalization of the Siegel modular group, and has the same relation to polarized abelian varieties that the Siegel modular group has to principally polarized abelian varieties. It is the group of automorphisms of Z2n preserving a non-degenerate skew symmetric form. The name \"paramodular group\" is often used to mean one of several standard matrix representations of this group. The corresponding group over the reals is called the parasymplectic group and is conjugate to a (real) symplectic group.  A paramodular form is a Siegel modular form for a paramodular group.","image":"c5dc265417b26ad82b4c20f8def09f7f987f25fc.svg","url":"Paramodular_group"}
