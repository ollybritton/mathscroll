{"title":"Fifth-order Korteweg–De Vries equation","summary":"A fifth-order Korteweg–De Vries (KdV) equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation in 1+1 dimensions related to the Korteweg–De Vries equation.[1] Fifth order KdV equations may be used to model dispersive phenomena such as plasma waves when the third-order contributions are small. The term may refer to equations of the form","image":"f6294ab0e75d641689849a1be4ca18f5a2e8df1b.svg","url":"Fifth-order_Korteweg–De_Vries_equation"}
