{"title":"Green's relations","summary":"In mathematics, Green's relations are five equivalence relations that characterise the elements of a semigroup in terms of the principal ideals they generate. The relations are named for James Alexander Green, who introduced them in a paper of 1951. John Mackintosh Howie, a prominent semigroup theorist, described this work as \"so all-pervading that, on encountering a new semigroup, almost the first question one asks is 'What are the Green relations like?'\" (Howie 2002). The relations are useful for understanding the nature of divisibility in a semigroup; they are also valid for groups, but in this case tell us nothing useful, because groups always have divisibility.","image":"c0a4a107d48cd2c8b607604fce0c21c043f9f28b.svg","url":"Green's_relations"}
