{"title":"Support of a module","summary":"In commutative algebra, the support of a module M over a commutative ring A is the set of all prime ideals p {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {p}}} of A such that M p ≠ 0 {\\displaystyle M_{\\mathfrak {p}}\\neq 0} (that is, the localization of M at p {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {p}}} is not equal to zero).[1] It is denoted by Supp ⁡ M {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Supp} M} .  The support is, by definition, a subset of the spectrum of A.","image":"a14c125cdf81ac25d76edc2e8d557302c9f555a9.svg","url":"Support_of_a_module"}
