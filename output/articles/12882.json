{"title":"Quarter 6-cubic honeycomb","summary":"In six-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the quarter 6-cubic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). It has half the vertices of the 6-demicubic honeycomb, and a quarter of the vertices of a 6-cube honeycomb.[1] Its facets are 6-demicubes, stericated 6-demicubes, and {3,3}Ã—{3,3} duoprisms.","image":"CDel_nodes_10ru.png.webp","url":"Quarter_6-cubic_honeycomb"}
