{"title":"Quaternion-Kähler manifold","summary":"In differential geometry, a quaternion-Kähler manifold (or quaternionic Kähler manifold) is a Riemannian 4n-manifold whose Riemannian holonomy group is a subgroup of Sp(n)·Sp(1) for some n ≥ 2 {\\displaystyle n\\geq 2} . Here Sp(n) is the sub-group of S O ( 4 n ) {\\displaystyle SO(4n)} consisting of those orthogonal transformations that arise by left-multiplication by some quaternionic n × n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} matrix, while the group S p ( 1 ) = S 3 {\\displaystyle Sp(1)=S^{3}} of unit-length quaternions instead acts on quaternionic n {\\displaystyle n} -space H n = R 4 n {\\displaystyle {\\mathbb {H} }^{n}={\\mathbb {R} }^{4n}} by right scalar multiplication. The Lie group S p ( n ) ⋅ S p ( 1 ) ⊂ S O ( 4 n ) {\\displaystyle Sp(n)\\cdot Sp(1)\\subset SO(4n)} generated by combining these actions is then abstractly isomorphic to [ S p ( n ) × S p ( 1 ) ] / Z 2 {\\displaystyle [Sp(n)\\times Sp(1)]/{\\mathbb {Z} }_{2}} .","image":"e6bf67f9d06ca3af619657f8d20ee1322da77174.svg","url":"Quaternion-Kähler_manifold"}
