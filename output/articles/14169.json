{"title":"Separation oracle","summary":"A separation oracle (also called a cutting-plane oracle) is a concept in the mathematical theory of convex optimization. It is a method to describe a convex set that is given as an input to an optimization algorithm. Separation oracles are used as input to ellipsoid methods.[1]: 87, 96, 98","image":"ed9873a43f54ffe46174fa2b2221f7d28c098820.svg","url":"Separation_oracle"}
