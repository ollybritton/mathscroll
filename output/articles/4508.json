{"title":"Duality theory for distributive lattices","summary":"In mathematics, duality theory for distributive lattices  provides three different (but closely related) representations of bounded distributive lattices via Priestley spaces, spectral spaces, and pairwise Stone spaces. This duality, which is originally also due to Marshall H. Stone,[1] generalizes the well-known Stone duality between Stone spaces and Boolean algebras.","image":"DL_Duality.png.webp","url":"Duality_theory_for_distributive_lattices"}
