{"title":"Classifying space for U(n)","summary":"In mathematics, the classifying space for the unitary group U(n) is a space BU(n) together with a universal bundle EU(n) such that any hermitian bundle on a paracompact space X is the pull-back of EU(n) by a map X â†’ BU(n) unique up to homotopy.","image":"01c2ab07bf4a5d1e478baef075058214077239ad.svg","url":"Classifying_space_for_U(n)"}
