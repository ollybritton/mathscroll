{"title":"Idempotent (ring theory)","summary":"In ring theory, a branch of abstract algebra, an idempotent element or simply idempotent of a ring is an element a such that a2 = a.[1] That is, the element is idempotent under the ring's multiplication. Inductively then, one can also conclude that a = a2 = a3 = a4 = ... = an for any positive integer n. For example, an idempotent element of a matrix ring is precisely an idempotent matrix.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Idempotent_(ring_theory)"}
