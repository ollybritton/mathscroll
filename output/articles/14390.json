{"title":"Simon problems","summary":"In mathematics, the Simon problems (or Simon's problems) are a series of fifteen questions posed in the year 2000 by Barry Simon, an American mathematical physicist.[1][2] Inspired by other collections of mathematical problems and open conjectures, such as the famous list by David Hilbert, the Simon problems concern quantum operators.[3] Eight of the problems pertain to anomalous spectral behavior of Schr√∂dinger operators, and five concern operators that incorporate the Coulomb potential.[1]","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Simon_problems"}
