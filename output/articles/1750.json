{"title":"Blaschke–Lebesgue theorem","summary":"In plane geometry the Blaschke–Lebesgue theorem states that the Reuleaux triangle has the least area of all curves of given constant width.[1] In the form that every curve of a given width has area at least as large as the Reuleaux triangle, it is also known as the Blaschke–Lebesgue inequality.[2] It is named after Wilhelm Blaschke and Henri Lebesgue, who published it separately in the early 20th century.","image":"Reuleaux_supporting_lines.svg.png.webp","url":"Blaschke–Lebesgue_theorem"}
