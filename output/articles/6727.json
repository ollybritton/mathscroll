{"title":"H-object","summary":"In mathematics, specifically homotopical algebra, an H-object[1] is a categorical generalization of an H-space, which can be defined in any category C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} with a product × {\\displaystyle \\times } and an initial object ∗ {\\displaystyle *} . These are useful constructions because they help export some of the ideas from algebraic topology and homotopy theory into other domains, such as in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.","image":"e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019.svg","url":"H-object"}
