{"title":"Galois extension","summary":"In mathematics, a Galois extension is an algebraic field extension E/F that is normal and separable;[1] or equivalently, E/F is algebraic, and the field fixed by the automorphism group Aut(E/F) is precisely the base field F. The significance of being a Galois extension is that the extension has a Galois group and obeys the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.[lower-alpha 1]","image":"ed517f58df99a7978a1dc0534235752526cb3343.svg","url":"Galois_extension"}
