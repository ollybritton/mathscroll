{"title":"Euclidean plane","summary":"In mathematics, a Euclidean plane is a Euclidean space of dimension two, denoted E2. It is a geometric space in which two real numbers are required to determine the position of each point. It is an affine space, which includes in particular the concept of parallel lines. It has also metrical properties induced by a distance, which allows to define circles, and angle measurement.","image":"Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg.png.webp","url":"Euclidean_plane"}
