{"title":"Gromov boundary","summary":"In mathematics, the Gromov boundary of a Î´-hyperbolic space (especially a hyperbolic group) is an abstract concept generalizing the boundary sphere of hyperbolic space. Conceptually, the Gromov boundary is the set of all points at infinity. For instance, the Gromov boundary of the real line is two points, corresponding to positive and negative infinity.","image":"F2_Cayley_Graph.png.webp","url":"Gromov_boundary"}
