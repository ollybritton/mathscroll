{"title":"Incidence matrix","summary":"In mathematics, an incidence matrix is a logical matrix that shows the relationship between two classes of objects, usually called an incidence relation. If the first class is X and the second is Y, the matrix has one row for each element of X and one column for each element of Y. The entry in row x and column y is 1 if x and y are related (called incident in this context) and 0 if they are not. There are variations; see below.","image":"Labeled_undirected_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Incidence_matrix"}
