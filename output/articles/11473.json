{"title":"Order-4 120-cell honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 4-space, the order-4 120-cell honeycomb is one of five compact regular space-filling tessellations (or honeycombs). With Schl√§fli symbol {5,3,3,4}, it has four 120-cells around each face. Its dual is the order-5 tesseractic honeycomb, {4,3,3,5}.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Order-4_120-cell_honeycomb"}
