{"title":"Predicate functor logic","summary":"In mathematical logic, predicate functor logic (PFL) is one of several ways to express first-order logic (also known as predicate logic) by purely algebraic means, i.e., without quantified variables. PFL employs a small number of algebraic devices called predicate functors (or predicate modifiers)[1] that operate on terms to yield terms. PFL is mostly the invention of the logician and philosopher Willard Quine.","image":"d2308ec6d1a551974242b51ad2731ea7bcebd0a6.svg","url":"Predicate_functor_logic"}
