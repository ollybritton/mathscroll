{"title":"Truncated square tiling","summary":"In geometry, the truncated square tiling is a semiregular tiling by regular polygons of the Euclidean plane with one square and two octagons on each vertex. This is the only edge-to-edge tiling by regular convex polygons which contains an octagon. It has Schl√§fli symbol of t{4,4}.","image":"Tiling_truncated_4a_simple.svg.png.webp","url":"Truncated_square_tiling"}
