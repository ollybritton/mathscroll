{"title":"Homotopy fiber","summary":"In mathematics, especially homotopy theory, the homotopy fiber (sometimes called the mapping fiber)[1]  is part of a construction that associates a fibration to an arbitrary continuous function of topological spaces f : A â†’ B {\\displaystyle f:A\\to B} . It acts as a homotopy theoretic kernel of a mapping of topological spaces due to the fact it yields a long exact sequence of homotopy groups","image":"20040a52d9391f2fe271f0aaa300bf7887a0c7b1.svg","url":"Homotopy_fiber"}
