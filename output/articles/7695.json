{"title":"Inclusion (Boolean algebra)","summary":"In Boolean algebra, the inclusion relation a ≤ b {\\displaystyle a\\leq b} is defined as a b ′ = 0 {\\displaystyle ab'=0} and is the Boolean analogue to the subset relation in set theory. Inclusion is a partial order.","image":"41558abc50886fdf38817495b243958d7b3dd39b.svg","url":"Inclusion_(Boolean_algebra)"}
