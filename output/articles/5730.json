{"title":"Freiman's theorem","summary":"In additive combinatorics, Freiman's theorem is a central result which indicates the approximate structure of sets whose sumset is small. It roughly states that if | A + A | / | A | {\\displaystyle |A+A|/|A|} is small, then A {\\displaystyle A} can be contained in a small generalized arithmetic progression.","image":"6893709081dc890026a2afaa5b05a91be686288c.svg","url":"Freiman's_theorem"}
