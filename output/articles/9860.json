{"title":"Maharam's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Maharam's theorem is a deep result about the decomposability of measure spaces, which plays an important role in the theory of Banach spaces.  In brief, it states that every complete measure space is decomposable into \"non-atomic parts\" (copies of products of the unit interval [0,1] on the reals), and \"purely atomic parts\", using the counting measure on some discrete space.[1] The theorem is due to Dorothy Maharam. It was extended to localizable measure spaces by Irving Segal.[2]","image":"58fe61351e3531b14043fa2d09e98c2437bd1a6a.svg","url":"Maharam's_theorem"}
