{"title":"Moreau's theorem","summary":"In mathematics, Moreau's theorem is a result in convex analysis named after French mathematician Jean-Jacques Moreau. It shows that sufficiently well-behaved convex functionals on Hilbert spaces are differentiable and the derivative is well-approximated by the so-called Yosida approximation, which is defined in terms of the resolvent operator.","image":"0f60a1f1cc5bfeecbd32dfe3eae18f784cea7e2b.svg","url":"Moreau's_theorem"}
