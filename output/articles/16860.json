{"title":"Weyl law","summary":"In mathematics, especially spectral theory, Weyl's law describes the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of the Laplace–Beltrami operator. This description was discovered in 1911 (in the d = 2 , 3 {\\displaystyle d=2,3} case) by Hermann Weyl for eigenvalues for the Laplace–Beltrami operator acting on functions that vanish at the boundary of a bounded domain Ω ⊂ R d {\\displaystyle \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb {R} ^{d}} . In particular, he proved that the number, N ( λ ) {\\displaystyle N(\\lambda )} , of Dirichlet eigenvalues (counting their multiplicities) less than or equal to λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } satisfies","image":"fc83230da88523dc3f203d073e1c54cdabb1d1d3.svg","url":"Weyl_law"}
