{"title":"Quater-imaginary base","summary":"The quater-imaginary numeral system is a numeral system, first proposed by Donald Knuth in 1960. Unlike standard numeral systems, which use an integer (such as 10 in decimal, or 2 in binary) as their bases, it uses the imaginary number 2i (equivalent to − 4 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {-4}}} ) as its base. It is able to (almost) uniquely represent every complex number using only the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3.[1] Numbers less than zero, which are ordinarily represented with a minus sign, are representable as digit strings in quater-imaginary; for example, the number −1 is represented as \"103\" in quater-imaginary notation.","image":"281ea962ee12be0ea8fb513c66cc20db4b598ddb.svg","url":"Quater-imaginary_base"}
