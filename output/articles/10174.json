{"title":"Matroid representation","summary":"In the mathematical theory of matroids, a matroid representation is a family of vectors whose linear independence relation is the same as that of a given matroid. Matroid representations are analogous to group representations; both types of representation provide abstract algebraic structures (matroids and groups respectively) with concrete descriptions in terms of linear algebra.","image":"926cadcc73c8a5f0086993832f965b0c503ec018.svg","url":"Matroid_representation"}
