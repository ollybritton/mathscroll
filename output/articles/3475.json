{"title":"Cotriple homology","summary":"In algebra, given a category C with a cotriple, the n-th cotriple homology of an object X in C with coefficients in a functor E is the n-th homotopy group of the E of the augmented simplicial object induced from X by the cotriple. The term \"homology\" is because in the abelian case, by the Doldâ€“Kan correspondence, the homotopy groups are the homology of the corresponding chain complex.","image":"9eac764702b6b01811a5b63c65450671151d6d8a.svg","url":"Cotriple_homology"}
