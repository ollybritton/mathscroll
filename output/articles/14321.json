{"title":"Siamak Yassemi","summary":"Siamak Yassemi (Persian: سیامک یاسمی) is an Iranian mathematician and is currently the Dean of Faculty of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science, University of Tehran, Iran.[2] He has found basic techniques that have played important roles in the field homological algebra. His recent works have established relationships between monomial ideals in commutative algebra and graphs in combinatorics, which have stimulated the development of the new interdisciplinary field combinatorial commutative algebra.[3] Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Islamic Republic of Iran, he has received the COMSTECH International Award, the 22nd Khwarizmi International Award in Basic Science and the International Award from Tehran University, among others. He was the vice president of the University College of Sciences at the University of Tehran for more than three years, ending in 2007. He was the head of the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences for more than two years. In 2015 he started to act as the head of the school of Mathematics, statistics and computer sciences at the University of Tehran. In 2018 he was elected by The World Academy of Sciences as a fellow member. That would make him the first Iranian mathematician who's ever been a member of TWAS.[4] In 2019 he was named Chevalier of the Ordre des Palmes Académiques for distinguished effort on extended multi-dimensional cooperation, including scientific research projects (Jundi-Shapur), student-and professor- exchanges, and several schools and conferences.","image":"Flowers_1-5-2-2-1_by_Hamid_Naderi_Yeganeh.png.webp","url":"Siamak_Yassemi"}
