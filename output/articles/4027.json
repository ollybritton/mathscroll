{"title":"Developable surface","summary":"In mathematics, a developable surface (or torse: archaic) is a smooth surface with zero Gaussian curvature.  That is, it is a surface that can be flattened onto a plane without distortion (i.e. it can be bent without stretching or compression).  Conversely, it is a surface which can be made by transforming a plane (i.e. \"folding\", \"bending\", \"rolling\", \"cutting\" and/or \"gluing\"). In three dimensions all developable surfaces are ruled surfaces (but not vice versa). There are developable surfaces in four-dimensional space R 4 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{4}} which are not ruled.[1]","image":"e4abb9b9dab94f7b25a4210364f0f9032704bfb9.svg","url":"Developable_surface"}
