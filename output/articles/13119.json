{"title":"Rank of an elliptic curve","summary":"In mathematics, the rank of an elliptic curve is the rational Mordellâ€“Weil rank of an elliptic curve E {\\displaystyle E} defined over the field of rational numbers. Mordell's theorem says the group of rational points on an elliptic curve has a finite basis. This means that for any elliptic curve there is a finite subset of the rational points on the curve, from which all further rational points may be generated. If the number of rational points on a curve is infinite then some point in a finite basis must have infinite order. The number of independent basis points with infinite order is the rank of the curve.","image":"4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b.svg","url":"Rank_of_an_elliptic_curve"}
