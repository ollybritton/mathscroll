{"title":"Stencil (numerical analysis)","summary":"In mathematics, especially the areas of numerical analysis concentrating on the numerical solution of partial differential equations, a stencil is a geometric arrangement of a nodal group that relate to the point of interest by using a numerical approximation routine. Stencils are the basis for many algorithms to numerically solve partial differential equations (PDE). Two examples of stencils are the five-point stencil and the Crankâ€“Nicolson method stencil.","image":"Crank-Nicolson-stencil.svg.png.webp","url":"Stencil_(numerical_analysis)"}
