{"title":"Multigraph","summary":"In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a multigraph  is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges (also called parallel edges[1]), that is, edges that have the same end nodes. Thus two vertices may be connected by more than one edge.","image":"Multi-pseudograph.svg.png.webp","url":"Multigraph"}
