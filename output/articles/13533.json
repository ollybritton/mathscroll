{"title":"Rider optimization algorithm","summary":"The rider optimization algorithm (ROA)[1][5][6] is devised based on a novel computing method, namely fictional computing that undergoes series of process to solve the issues of optimizations using imaginary facts and notions. ROA relies on the groups of rider that struggle to reach the target. ROA employs rider groups that take a trip to reach common target in order to become winner. In ROA, the count of groups is four wherein equal riders are placed.","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Rider_optimization_algorithm"}
