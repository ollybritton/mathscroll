{"title":"XYZ inequality","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, the XYZ inequality, also called the Fishburnâ€“Shepp inequality, is an inequality for the number of linear extensions of finite partial orders. The inequality was conjectured by Ivan Rival and Bill Sands in 1981. It was proved by Lawrence Shepp in Shepp (1982). An extension was given by Peter Fishburn in Fishburn (1984).","image":"1fcb91b3002645d3abd1e4d1a7807dd49684bb94.svg","url":"XYZ_inequality"}
