{"title":"Graph flattenability","summary":"Flattenability in some d {\\displaystyle d} -dimensional normed vector space is a property of graphs which states that any embedding, or drawing, of the graph in some high dimension d â€² {\\displaystyle d'} can be \"flattened\" down to live in d {\\displaystyle d} -dimensions, such that the distances between pairs of points connected by edges are preserved.  A graph G {\\displaystyle G} is d {\\displaystyle d} -flattenable if every distance constraint system (DCS) with G {\\displaystyle G} as its constraint graph has a d {\\displaystyle d} -dimensional framework.  Flattenability was first called realizability,[1] but the name was changed to avoid confusion with a graph having some DCS with a d {\\displaystyle d} -dimensional framework.[2]","image":"e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab.svg","url":"Graph_flattenability"}
