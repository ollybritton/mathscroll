{"title":"List of numbers","summary":"This is a list of notable numbers and articles about notable numbers. The list does not contain all numbers in existence as most of the number sets are infinite. Numbers may be included in the list based on their mathematical, historical or cultural notability, but all numbers have qualities which could arguably make them notable. Even the smallest \"uninteresting\" number is paradoxically interesting for that very property. This is known as the interesting number paradox.","image":"7dcdf44171e54385806a87720a1968bb2c37536a.svg","url":"List_of_numbers"}
