{"title":"Direct sum of groups","summary":"In mathematics, a group G is called the direct sum[1][2] of two normal subgroups with trivial intersection if it is generated by the subgroups. In abstract algebra, this method of construction of groups can be generalized to direct sums of vector spaces, modules, and other structures; see the article direct sum of modules for more information. A group which can be expressed as a direct sum of non-trivial subgroups is called decomposable, and if a group cannot be expressed as such a direct sum then it is called indecomposable.","image":"Cyclic_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Direct_sum_of_groups"}
