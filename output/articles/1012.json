{"title":"Arnold diffusion","summary":"In applied mathematics, Arnold diffusion is the phenomenon of instability of integrable Hamiltonian systems.  The phenomenon is named after Vladimir Arnold who was the first to publish a result in the field in 1964.[1][2]  More precisely, Arnold diffusion refers to results asserting the existence of solutions to nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems that exhibit a significant change in the action variables.","image":"b5bbb97e3f39459ada56daf04b03ffc61acf9495.svg","url":"Arnold_diffusion"}
