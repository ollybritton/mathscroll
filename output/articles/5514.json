{"title":"Fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces","summary":"In mathematics, a number of fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces generalise the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. They have applications, for example, to the proof of existence theorems for partial differential equations.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg","url":"Fixed-point_theorems_in_infinite-dimensional_spaces"}
