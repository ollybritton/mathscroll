{"title":"Thickness (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, the thickness of a graph G is the minimum number of planar graphs into which the edges of G can be partitioned. That is, if there exists a collection of k planar graphs, all having the same set of vertices, such that the union of these planar graphs is G, then the thickness of G is at most k.[1][2] In other words, the thickness of a graph is the minimum number of planar subgraphs whose union equals to graph G.[3]","image":"1a746c67af7398cca0d0df63d9ba4e4791f34514.svg","url":"Thickness_(graph_theory)"}
