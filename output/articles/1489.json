{"title":"Bernoulli distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the Bernoulli distribution, named after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli,[1] is the discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability p {\\displaystyle p} and the value 0 with probability q = 1 − p {\\displaystyle q=1-p} . Less formally, it can be thought of as a model for the set of possible outcomes of any single experiment that asks a yes–no question. Such questions lead to outcomes that are boolean-valued: a single bit whose value is success/yes/true/one with probability p and failure/no/false/zero with probability q. It can be used to represent a (possibly biased) coin toss where 1 and 0 would represent \"heads\" and \"tails\", respectively, and p would be the probability of the coin landing on heads (or vice versa where 1 would represent tails and p would be the probability of tails).  In particular, unfair coins would have p ≠ 1 / 2. {\\displaystyle p\\neq 1/2.}","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Bernoulli_distribution"}
