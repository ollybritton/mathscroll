{"title":"B7 polytope","summary":"In 7-dimensional geometry, there are 128 uniform polytopes with B7 symmetry. There are two regular forms, the 7-orthoplex, and 8-cube with 14 and 128 vertices respectively. The 7-demicube is added with half of the symmetry.","image":"7-cube_t0.svg.png.webp","url":"B7_polytope"}
