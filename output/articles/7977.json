{"title":"Invariant measure","summary":"In mathematics, an invariant measure is a measure that is preserved by some function. The function may be a geometric transformation. For examples, circular angle is invariant under rotation, hyperbolic angle is  invariant under squeeze mapping, and a difference of slopes is invariant under shear mapping.[1]","image":"63c4fcf15808c3dbf52cc4b3fd473e97e231f53f.svg","url":"Invariant_measure"}
