{"title":"Excision theorem","summary":"In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, the excision theorem is a theorem about relative homology and one of the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms. Given a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} and subspaces A {\\displaystyle A} and U {\\displaystyle U} such that U {\\displaystyle U} is also a subspace of A {\\displaystyle A} , the theorem says that under certain circumstances, we can cut out (excise) U {\\displaystyle U} from both spaces such that the relative homologies of the pairs ( X ∖ U , A ∖ U ) {\\displaystyle (X\\setminus U,A\\setminus U)} into ( X , A ) {\\displaystyle (X,A)} are isomorphic.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Excision_theorem"}
