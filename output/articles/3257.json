{"title":"Conserved current","summary":"In physics a conserved current is a current, j μ {\\displaystyle j^{\\mu }} , that satisfies the continuity equation ∂ μ j μ = 0 {\\displaystyle \\partial _{\\mu }j^{\\mu }=0} . The continuity equation represents a conservation law, hence the name.","image":"55d73bb66707f932f561fce1669b06587038fee8.svg","url":"Conserved_current"}
