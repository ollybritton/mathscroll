{"title":"Fano variety","summary":"In algebraic geometry,  a Fano variety, introduced by Gino Fano in (Fano 1934, 1942), is a complete variety X whose anticanonical bundle KX* is ample. In this definition, one could assume that X is smooth over a field, but the minimal model program has also led to the study of Fano varieties with various types of singularities, such as terminal or klt singularities. Recently techniques in differential geometry have been applied to the study of Fano varieties over the complex numbers, and success has been found in constructing moduli spaces of Fano varieties and proving the existence of Kähler–Einstein metrics on them through the study of K-stability of Fano varieties.","image":"3170463d3a9f221076c17e73f92d4ede129f22ce.svg","url":"Fano_variety"}
