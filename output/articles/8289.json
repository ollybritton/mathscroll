{"title":"Jessen's icosahedron","summary":"Jessen's icosahedron, sometimes called Jessen's orthogonal icosahedron, is a non-convex polyhedron with the same numbers of vertices, edges, and faces as the regular icosahedron. It is named for BÃ¸rge Jessen, who studied it in 1967.[1] In 1971, a family of nonconvex polyhedra including this shape was independently discovered and studied by Adrien Douady under the name six-beaked shaddock;[2][3] later authors have applied variants of this name more specifically to Jessen's icosahedron.[4]","image":"Jessen's_icosahedron.svg.png.webp","url":"Jessen's_icosahedron"}
