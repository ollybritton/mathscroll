{"title":"Finsler manifold","summary":"In mathematics, particularly differential geometry, a Finsler manifold is a differentiable manifold M where a (possibly asymmetric) Minkowski functional F(x, −) is provided on each tangent space TxM, that enables one to define the length of any smooth curve γ : [a, b] → M as","image":"1f85cc974ccfceb06d2ce3a10de5fd61f324e252.svg","url":"Finsler_manifold"}
