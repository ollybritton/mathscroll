{"title":"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics","summary":"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is an umbrella term used to group together the distinct but related technical disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The term is typically used in the context of education policy or curriculum choices in schools. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns (as a shortage of STEM-educated citizens can reduce effectiveness in this area) and immigration policy, with regards to admitting foreign students and tech workers.[1]","image":"NASA_Goddard_Hosts_Young_Women_for_STEM_Girls_Night_In_2018.jpg.webp","url":"Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics"}
