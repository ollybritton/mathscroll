{"title":"Dual q-Hahn polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the dual q-Hahn polynomials are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme. Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties.","image":"f3f987966bca7e6403b481ff8b740cdb93afd415.svg","url":"Dual_q-Hahn_polynomials"}
