{"title":"Reduced ring","summary":"In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, a ring is called a reduced ring if it has no non-zero nilpotent elements.  Equivalently, a ring is reduced if it has no non-zero elements with square zero, that is, x2 = 0 implies x = 0. A commutative algebra over a commutative ring is called a reduced algebra if its underlying ring is reduced.","image":"533f4bfe3a3bbf30f8323385e8075bb8d466a494.svg","url":"Reduced_ring"}
