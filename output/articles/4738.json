{"title":"Ellipse","summary":"In mathematics, an ellipse is a plane curve surrounding two focal points, such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant. It generalizes a circle, which is the special type of ellipse in which the two focal points are the same. The elongation of an ellipse is measured by its eccentricity e {\\displaystyle e} , a number ranging from e = 0 {\\displaystyle e=0} (the limiting case of a circle) to e = 1 {\\displaystyle e=1} (the limiting case of infinite elongation, no longer an ellipse but a parabola).","image":"cd253103f0876afc68ebead27a5aa9867d927467.svg","url":"Ellipse"}
