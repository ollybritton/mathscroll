{"title":"Weak ordering","summary":"In mathematics, especially order theory, a weak ordering is a mathematical formalization of the intuitive notion of a ranking of a set, some of whose members may be tied with each other. Weak orders are a generalization of totally ordered sets (rankings without ties) and are in turn generalized by (strictly) partially ordered sets and preorders.[1]","image":"Green_check.svg.png.webp","url":"Weak_ordering"}
