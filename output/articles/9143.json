{"title":"Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics, the Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes, named after Solomon Lefschetz, is a classical statement relating holomorphic line bundles on a compact Kähler manifold to classes in its integral cohomology. It is the only case of the Hodge conjecture which has been proved for all Kähler manifolds.[1]","image":"f8fb0b896b1b2a45546779ecafc567f4f1688714.svg","url":"Lefschetz_theorem_on_(1,1)-classes"}
