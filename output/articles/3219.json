{"title":"Conjugacy class sum","summary":"In abstract algebra, a conjugacy class sum, or simply class sum, is a function defined for each conjugacy class of a finite group G as the sum of the elements in that conjugacy class. The class sums of a group form a basis for the center of the associated group algebra.","image":"13a5359842d63bcc4092e99a3d5c27b537a61679.svg","url":"Conjugacy_class_sum"}
