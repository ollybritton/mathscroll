{"title":"Integer triangle","summary":"An integer triangle or integral triangle is a triangle all of whose side lengths are integers.  A rational triangle is one whose side lengths are rational numbers; any rational triangle can be rescaled by the lowest common denominator of the  sides to obtain a similar integer triangle, so there is a close relationship between integer triangles and rational triangles.","image":"Triangle-heronian.svg.png.webp","url":"Integer_triangle"}
