{"title":"Reshetikhin–Turaev invariant","summary":"In the mathematical field of quantum topology, the Reshetikhin–Turaev invariants (RT-invariants) are a family of quantum invariants of framed links. Such invariants of framed links also give rise to invariants of 3-manifolds via the Dehn surgery construction. These invariants were discovered by Nicolai Reshetikhin and Vladimir Turaev in 1991,[1] and were meant to be a mathematical realization of Witten's proposed invariants of links and 3-manifolds using quantum field theory.[2]","image":"cdba77686112891f2431f01b94d4738be861f15a.svg","url":"Reshetikhin–Turaev_invariant"}
