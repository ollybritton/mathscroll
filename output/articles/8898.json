{"title":"Kushner equation","summary":"In filtering theory the Kushner equation (after Harold Kushner) is an equation for the conditional probability density of the state of a stochastic non-linear dynamical system, given noisy measurements of the state.[1]  It therefore provides the solution of the nonlinear filtering problem in estimation theory. The equation is sometimes referred to as the Stratonovich–Kushner[2][3][4][5] (or Kushner–Stratonovich) equation. However, the correct equation in terms of Itō calculus was first derived by Kushner although a more heuristic Stratonovich version of it appeared already in Stratonovich's works in late fifties. However, the derivation in terms of Itō calculus is due to Richard Bucy.[6]","image":"269708d573ea072feff05a5b2066b5de6964f34a.svg","url":"Kushner_equation"}
