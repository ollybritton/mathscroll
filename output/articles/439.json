{"title":"Affine q-Krawtchouk polynomials","summary":"In mathematics, the affine q-Krawtchouk polynomials  are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme, introduced by Carlitz and Hodges. Roelof Koekoek, Peter A. Lesky, and René F. Swarttouw (2010, 14) give a detailed list of their properties.","image":"b148c51a1311cf2c1eea5f797f574b3a23707521.svg","url":"Affine_q-Krawtchouk_polynomials"}
