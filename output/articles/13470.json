{"title":"Rhombicuboctahedron","summary":"In geometry, the rhombicuboctahedron, or small rhombicuboctahedron or  Rectified Rhombic Dodecahedron, is a polyhedron with eight triangular, six square, and twelve rectangular faces. There are 24 identical vertices, with one triangle, one square, and two rectangles meeting at each one. If all the rectangles are themselves square (equivalently, all the edges are the same length, ensuring the triangles are equilateral), it is an Archimedean solid. The polyhedron has octahedral symmetry, like the cube and octahedron. Its dual is called the deltoidal icositetrahedron or trapezoidal icositetrahedron, although its faces are not really true trapezoids.","image":"Rhombicuboctahedron.jpg.webp","url":"Rhombicuboctahedron"}
