{"title":"Contradiction","summary":"In traditional logic, a contradiction occurs when a proposition conflicts either with itself or established fact. It is often used as a tool to detect disingenuous beliefs and bias. Illustrating a general tendency in applied logic, Aristotle's law of noncontradiction states that \"It is impossible that the same thing can at the same time both belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect.\"[1]","image":"Square_of_opposition%2C_set_diagrams.svg.png.webp","url":"Contradiction"}
