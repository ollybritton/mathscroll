{"title":"Alpha recursion theory","summary":"In recursion theory, α recursion theory is a generalisation of recursion theory to subsets of admissible ordinals α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } .  An admissible set is closed under Σ 1 ( L α ) {\\displaystyle \\Sigma _{1}(L_{\\alpha })} functions, where L ξ {\\displaystyle L_{\\xi }} denotes a rank of Godel's constructible hierarchy. α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } is an admissible ordinal if L α {\\displaystyle L_{\\alpha }} is a  model of Kripke–Platek set theory.  In what follows α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } is considered to be fixed.","image":"b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3.svg","url":"Alpha_recursion_theory"}
