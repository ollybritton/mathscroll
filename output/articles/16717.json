{"title":"Waldspurger formula","summary":"In representation theory of mathematics, the Waldspurger formula relates the special values of two L-functions of two related admissible irreducible representations.   Let k be the base field, f be an automorphic form over k, π be the representation associated via the Jacquet–Langlands correspondence with f. Goro Shimura (1976) proved this formula, when k = Q {\\displaystyle k=\\mathbb {Q} } and f is a cusp form; Günter Harder made the same discovery at the same time in an unpublished paper. Marie-France Vignéras (1980) proved this formula, when k = Q {\\displaystyle k=\\mathbb {Q} } and f is a newform.  Jean-Loup Waldspurger, for whom the formula is named, reproved and generalized the result of Vignéras in 1985 via a totally different method which was widely used thereafter by mathematicians to prove similar formulas.","image":"17db686dc27ec7360b5fa41c372a2e0625cd33f4.svg","url":"Waldspurger_formula"}
