{"title":"Shephard's problem","summary":"In mathematics, Shephard's problem, is the following geometrical question asked by Geoffrey Colin Shephard in 1964: if K and L are centrally symmetric convex bodies in n-dimensional Euclidean space such that whenever K and L are projected onto a hyperplane, the volume of the projection of K is smaller than the volume of the projection of L, then does it follow that the volume of K is smaller than that of L?[1]","image":"a228685e7fdbc37fa76feac613141adab8bfec7b.svg","url":"Shephard's_problem"}
