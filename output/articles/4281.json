{"title":"Disjunctive normal form","summary":"In boolean logic, a disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a canonical normal form of a logical formula consisting of a disjunction of conjunctions; it can also be described as an OR of ANDs, a sum of products, or (in philosophical logic) a cluster concept.  As a normal form, it is useful in automated theorem proving.","image":"1caa4004cb216ef2930bb12fe805a76870caed94.svg","url":"Disjunctive_normal_form"}
