{"title":"Generalized Clifford algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a Generalized Clifford algebra (GCA) is a unital associative algebra that generalizes the Clifford algebra, and goes back to the work of Hermann Weyl,[1] who  utilized and formalized  these clock-and-shift operators introduced by J. J. Sylvester (1882),[2] and organized by  Cartan (1898)[3]  and  Schwinger.[4]","image":"b25d6a765dc594640b4d392d51747568b9cc26fa.svg","url":"Generalized_Clifford_algebra"}
