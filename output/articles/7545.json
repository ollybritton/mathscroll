{"title":"Hypocontinuous bilinear map","summary":"In mathematics, a hypocontinuous is a condition on bilinear maps of topological vector spaces that is weaker than continuity but stronger than separate continuity. Many important bilinear maps that are not continuous are, in fact, hypocontinuous.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Hypocontinuous_bilinear_map"}
