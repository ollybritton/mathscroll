{"title":"Slice theorem (differential geometry)","summary":"In differential geometry, the slice theorem states:[1] given a manifold M on which a Lie group G acts as diffeomorphisms, for any x in M, the map G / G x → M , [ g ] ↦ g ⋅ x {\\displaystyle G/G_{x}\\to M,\\,[g]\\mapsto g\\cdot x} extends to an invariant neighborhood of G / G x {\\displaystyle G/G_{x}} (viewed as a zero section)  in G × G x T x M / T x ( G ⋅ x ) {\\displaystyle G\\times _{G_{x}}T_{x}M/T_{x}(G\\cdot x)} so that it defines an equivariant diffeomorphism from the neighborhood to its image, which contains the orbit of x.","image":"7e7fb97cc5b036a1eb73103b03f28eb8c4a8bd04.svg","url":"Slice_theorem_(differential_geometry)"}
