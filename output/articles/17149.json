{"title":"Zero-symmetric graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a zero-symmetric graph is a connected graph in which each vertex has exactly three incident edges and, for each two vertices, there is a unique symmetry taking one vertex to the other. Such a graph is a vertex-transitive graph but cannot be an edge-transitive graph: the number of symmetries equals the number of vertices, too few to take every edge to every other edge.[1]","image":"Two-edge-orbit_GRR.svg.png.webp","url":"Zero-symmetric_graph"}
