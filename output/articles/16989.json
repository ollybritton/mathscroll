{"title":"Wilson prime","summary":"In number theory, a Wilson prime is a prime number p {\\displaystyle p} such that p 2 {\\displaystyle p^{2}} divides ( p − 1 ) ! + 1 {\\displaystyle (p-1)!+1} , where \" ! {\\displaystyle !} \" denotes the factorial function; compare this with Wilson's theorem, which states that every prime p {\\displaystyle p} divides ( p − 1 ) ! + 1 {\\displaystyle (p-1)!+1} . Both are named for 18th-century English mathematician John Wilson; in 1770, Edward Waring credited the theorem to Wilson,[1] although it had been stated centuries earlier by Ibn al-Haytham.[2]","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Wilson_prime"}
