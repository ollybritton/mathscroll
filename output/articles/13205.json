{"title":"Rectangular lattice","summary":"The rectangular lattice and rhombic lattice (or centered rectangular lattice) constitute two of the five two-dimensional Bravais lattice types.[1] The symmetry categories of these lattices are wallpaper groups pmm and cmm respectively. The conventional translation vectors of the rectangular lattices form an angle of 90Â° and are of unequal lengths.","image":"Rectangular_Lattice.svg.png.webp","url":"Rectangular_lattice"}
