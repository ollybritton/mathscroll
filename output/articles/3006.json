{"title":"Complex conjugate","summary":"In mathematics, the complex conjugate of a complex number is the number with an equal real part and an imaginary part equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. That is, (if a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} are real, then) the complex conjugate of a + b i {\\displaystyle a+bi} is equal to a − b i . {\\displaystyle a-bi.} The complex conjugate of z {\\displaystyle z} is often denoted as z ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\overline {z}}} or z ∗ {\\displaystyle z^{*}} .","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"Complex_conjugate"}
