{"title":"Fluxion","summary":"A fluxion is the instantaneous rate of change, or gradient, of a fluent (a time-varying quantity, or function) at a given point.[1] Fluxions were introduced by Isaac Newton to describe his form of a time derivative (a derivative with respect to time). Newton introduced the concept in 1665 and detailed them in his mathematical treatise, Method of Fluxions.[2] Fluxions and fluents made up Newton's early calculus.[3]","image":"The_method_of_fluxions_and_infinite_series_p.20.gif","url":"Fluxion"}
