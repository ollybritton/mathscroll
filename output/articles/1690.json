{"title":"Birational geometry","summary":"In mathematics, birational geometry is a field of algebraic geometry in which the goal is to determine when two algebraic varieties are isomorphic outside lower-dimensional subsets. This amounts to studying mappings that are given by rational functions rather than polynomials; the map may fail to be defined where the rational functions have poles.","image":"Stereoprojzero.svg.png.webp","url":"Birational_geometry"}
