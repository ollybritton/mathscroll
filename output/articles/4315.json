{"title":"Distribution function (measure theory)","summary":"In mathematics, a distribution function is a real function in measure theory. From every measure on the algebra of Borel sets of real numbers, a distribution function can be constructed, which reflects some of the properties of this measure. Distribution functions (in the sense of measure theory) are a generalization of distribution functions (in the sense of probability theory).","image":"9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161.svg","url":"Distribution_function_(measure_theory)"}
