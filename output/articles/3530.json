{"title":"Cram (game)","summary":"Cram is a mathematical game played on a sheet of graph paper. It is the impartial version of Domineering and the only difference in the rules is that players may place their dominoes in either orientation, but it results in a very different game. It has been called by many names, including \"plugg\" by Geoffrey Mott-Smith, and \"dots-and-pairs\".  Cram was popularized by Martin Gardner in Scientific American.[1]","image":"Cram_Game_Example_1.svg.png.webp","url":"Cram_(game)"}
