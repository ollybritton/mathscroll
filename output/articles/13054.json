{"title":"Rainbow coloring","summary":"In graph theory, a path in an edge-colored graph is said to be rainbow if no color repeats on it. A graph is said to be rainbow-connected (or rainbow colored) if there is a rainbow path between each pair of its vertices. If there is a rainbow shortest path between each pair of vertices, the graph is said to be strongly rainbow-connected (or strongly rainbow colored).[1]","image":"Wheel_rainbow_coloring.svg.png.webp","url":"Rainbow_coloring"}
