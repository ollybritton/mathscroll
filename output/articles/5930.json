{"title":"Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem","summary":"In graph theory, the Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem is a form of duality between the colorings of the vertices of a given undirected graph and the orientations of its edges. It states that the minimum number of colors needed to properly color any graph G {\\displaystyle G} equals one plus the length of a longest path in an orientation of G {\\displaystyle G} chosen to minimize this path's length.[1] The orientations for which the longest path has minimum length always include at least one acyclic orientation.[2]","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver_theorem"}
