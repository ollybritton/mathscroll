{"title":"Nuclear operators between Banach spaces","summary":"In mathematics, nuclear operators between Banach spaces  are a linear operators between Banach spaces in infinite dimensions that share some of the properties of their counter-part in finite dimension. In Hilbert spaces such operators are usually called trace class operators and one can define such things as the trace. In Banach spaces this is no longer possible for general nuclear operators, it is however possible for 2 3 {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {2}{3}}} -nuclear operator via the Grothendieck trace theorem.","image":"571a6ce6d697175e9e5e723b8c40eaa7efcfeaca.svg","url":"Nuclear_operators_between_Banach_spaces"}
