{"title":"Fredholm theory","summary":"In mathematics, Fredholm theory is a theory of integral equations. In the narrowest sense, Fredholm theory concerns itself with the solution of the Fredholm integral equation. In a broader sense, the abstract structure of Fredholm's theory is given in terms of the spectral theory of Fredholm operators and Fredholm kernels on Hilbert space. The theory is named in honour of Erik Ivar Fredholm.","image":"2d14a6190e46e0b7645487a170314fa3f323e686.svg","url":"Fredholm_theory"}
