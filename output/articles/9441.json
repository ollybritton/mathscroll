{"title":"List of Johnson solids","summary":"In geometry, a Johnson solid is a strictly convex polyhedron, each face of which is a regular polygon, but which is not uniform, i.e., not a Platonic solid, Archimedean solid, prism or antiprism. In 1966, Norman Johnson published a list which included all 92 solids, and gave them their names and numbers. He did not prove that there were only 92, but he did conjecture that there were no others. Victor Zalgaller proved in 1969 that Johnson's list was complete.","image":"Johnson_solid_1_net.png.webp","url":"List_of_Johnson_solids"}
