{"title":"Szegő kernel","summary":"In the mathematical study of several complex variables, the Szegő kernel is an integral kernel that gives rise to a reproducing kernel on a natural Hilbert space of holomorphic functions.  It is named for its discoverer, the Hungarian mathematician Gábor Szegő.","image":"86f6b4b87fefc0caa4b0619fb9aa46d617a12359.svg","url":"Szegő_kernel"}
