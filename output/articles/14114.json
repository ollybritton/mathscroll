{"title":"Semi-simplicity","summary":"In mathematics, semi-simplicity is a widespread concept in disciplines such as linear algebra, abstract algebra, representation theory, category theory, and algebraic geometry. A semi-simple object is one that can be decomposed into a sum of simple objects, and simple objects are those that do not contain non-trivial proper sub-objects. The precise definitions of these words depends on the context.","image":"f0fabb548ced097e03f45cf54dbb066d23d010f3.svg","url":"Semi-simplicity"}
