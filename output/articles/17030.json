{"title":"Writing of Principia Mathematica","summary":"Isaac Newton composed Principia Mathematica during 1685 and 1686,[1] and it was published in a first edition on 5 July 1687. Widely regarded as one of the most important works in both the science of physics and in applied mathematics during the Scientific Revolution, the work underlies much of the technological and scientific advances from the Industrial Revolution (usually dated from 1750) which it helped to create.","image":"NewtonsPrincipia.jpg.webp","url":"Writing_of_Principia_Mathematica"}
