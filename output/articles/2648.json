{"title":"Circle graph","summary":"In graph theory, a circle graph is  the intersection graph of a chord diagram. That is, it is an undirected graph whose vertices can be associated with a finite system of chords of a circle such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding chords cross each other.","image":"Circle_graph_and_circle_model.svg.png.webp","url":"Circle_graph"}
