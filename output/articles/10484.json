{"title":"Minimal ideal","summary":"In the branch of abstract algebra known as ring theory, a minimal right ideal of a ring R is a non-zero right ideal which contains no other non-zero right ideal. Likewise, a minimal left ideal is a non-zero left ideal of R containing no other non-zero left ideals of R, and a minimal ideal of R is a non-zero ideal containing no other non-zero two-sided ideal of R (Isaacs 2009, p.Â 190).","image":"aa7d1b6a7d05a90c8038f898597a3877ab475315.svg","url":"Minimal_ideal"}
