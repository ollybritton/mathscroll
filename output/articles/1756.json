{"title":"Bloch's theorem (complex variables)","summary":"In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, Bloch's theorem describes the behaviour of holomorphic functions defined on the unit disk. It gives a lower bound on the size of a disk in which an inverse to a holomorphic function exists. It is named after Andr√© Bloch.","image":"c681f851453ef191f6adcfd9237048fac6d5201e.svg","url":"Bloch's_theorem_(complex_variables)"}
