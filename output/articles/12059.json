{"title":"Perturbation problem beyond all orders","summary":"In mathematics, perturbation theory works typically by expanding unknown quantity in a power series in a small parameter.  However, in a perturbation problem beyond all orders, all coefficients of the perturbation expansion vanish and the difference between the function and the constant function 0 cannot be detected by a power series.","image":"c445298cbda95202c1dabbd699c89614ca48e797.svg","url":"Perturbation_problem_beyond_all_orders"}
