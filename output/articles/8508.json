{"title":"Jónsson function","summary":"In mathematical set theory, an ω-Jónsson function for a set x of ordinals is a function f : [ x ] ω → x {\\displaystyle f:[x]^{\\omega }\\to x} with the property that, for any subset y of x with the same cardinality as x, the restriction of f {\\displaystyle f} to [ y ] ω {\\displaystyle [y]^{\\omega }} is surjective on x {\\displaystyle x} . Here [ x ] ω {\\displaystyle [x]^{\\omega }} denotes the set of strictly increasing sequences of members of x {\\displaystyle x} , or equivalently the family of subsets of x {\\displaystyle x} with order type ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } , using a standard notation for the family of subsets with a given order type. Jónsson functions are named for Bjarni Jónsson.","image":"9b4d7e4beef6972f0b28f7f88b2d2a0b0aafb43f.svg","url":"Jónsson_function"}
