{"title":"Pentagonal hexecontahedron","summary":"In geometry, a pentagonal hexecontahedron is a Catalan solid, dual of the snub dodecahedron. It has two distinct forms, which are mirror images (or \"enantiomorphs\") of each other. It has 92 vertices that span 60 pentagonal faces. It is the Catalan solid with the most vertices. Among the Catalan and Archimedean solids, it has the second largest number of vertices, after the truncated icosidodecahedron, which has 120 vertices.","image":"Pentagonalhexecontahedron.jpg.webp","url":"Pentagonal_hexecontahedron"}
