{"title":"Fundamental theorem of linear programming","summary":"In mathematical optimization, the fundamental theorem of linear programming states, in a weak formulation, that the maxima and minima of a linear function over a convex polygonal region occur at the region's corners. Further, if an extreme value occurs at two corners, then it must also occur everywhere on the line segment between them.","image":"12d98c57882ef822f1a4eff130bf34c16460eb26.svg","url":"Fundamental_theorem_of_linear_programming"}
