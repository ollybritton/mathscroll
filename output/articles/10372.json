{"title":"Metric derivative","summary":"In mathematics, the metric derivative is a notion of derivative appropriate to parametrized paths in metric spaces. It generalizes the notion of \"speed\" or \"absolute velocity\" to spaces which have a notion of distance (i.e. metric spaces) but not direction (such as vector spaces).","image":"d78e6f2ddf5baee227ee2a9f164726ba0c23c263.svg","url":"Metric_derivative"}
