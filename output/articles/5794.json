{"title":"Fréchet–Urysohn space","summary":"In the field of topology, a Fréchet–Urysohn space is a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} with the property that for every subset S ⊆ X {\\displaystyle S\\subseteq X} the closure of S {\\displaystyle S} in X {\\displaystyle X} is identical to the sequential closure of S {\\displaystyle S} in X . {\\displaystyle X.} Fréchet–Urysohn spaces are a special type of sequential space.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Fréchet–Urysohn_space"}
