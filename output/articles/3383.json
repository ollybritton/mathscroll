{"title":"Convex cone","summary":"In linear algebra, a cone—sometimes called a linear cone for distinguishing it from other sorts of cones—is a subset of a vector space that is closed under scalar multiplication; that is, C is a cone if x ∈ C {\\displaystyle x\\in C} implies s x ∈ C {\\displaystyle sx\\in C} for every positive scalar s.","image":"f7fc788379bff7289bdf694ffd68ee690e999eb7.svg","url":"Convex_cone"}
