{"title":"Oper (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, an Oper is a principal connection, or in more elementary terms a type of differential operator. They were first defined and used by Vladimir Drinfeld and Vladimir Sokolov[1] to study how the KdV equation and related integrable PDEs correspond to algebraic structures known as Kacâ€“Moody algebras. Their modern formulation is due to Drinfeld and Alexander Beilinson.[2]","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Oper_(mathematics)"}
