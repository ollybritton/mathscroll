{"title":"Dirichlet–Jordan test","summary":"In mathematics, the Dirichlet–Jordan test gives sufficient conditions for a real-valued, periodic function f to be equal to the sum of its Fourier series at a point of continuity. Moreover, the behavior of the Fourier series at points of discontinuity is determined as well (it is the midpoint of the values of the discontinuity). It is one of many conditions for the convergence of Fourier series.","image":"202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074.svg","url":"Dirichlet–Jordan_test"}
