{"title":"Totally disconnected space","summary":"In topology and related branches of mathematics, a totally disconnected space is a topological space that has only singletons as connected subsets. In every topological space, the singletons (and, when it is considered connected, the empty set) are connected; in a totally disconnected space, these are the only connected subsets.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Totally_disconnected_space"}
