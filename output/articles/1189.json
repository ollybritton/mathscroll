{"title":"Axiom of choice","summary":"In mathematics, the axiom of choice, or AC, is an axiom of set theory equivalent to the statement that a Cartesian product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of sets, each containing at least one element, it is possible to construct a new set by arbitrarily choosing one element from each set, even if the collection is infinite. Formally, it states that for every indexed family ( S i ) i ∈ I {\\displaystyle (S_{i})_{i\\in I}} of nonempty sets, there exists an indexed set ( x i ) i ∈ I {\\displaystyle (x_{i})_{i\\in I}} such that x i ∈ S i {\\displaystyle x_{i}\\in S_{i}} for every i ∈ I {\\displaystyle i\\in I} . The axiom of choice was formulated in 1904 by Ernst Zermelo in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering theorem.[1]","image":"678af8cfde54ae12ee7322dcac4b969eae1b021a.svg","url":"Axiom_of_choice"}
