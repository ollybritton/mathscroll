{"title":"Path (graph theory)","summary":"In graph theory, a path in a graph is a finite or infinite sequence of edges which joins a sequence of vertices which, by most definitions, are all distinct (and since the vertices are distinct, so are the edges). A directed path (sometimes called dipath[1]) in a directed graph is a finite or infinite sequence of edges which joins a sequence of distinct vertices, but with the added restriction that the edges be all directed in the same direction.","image":"Snake-in-the-box_and_Hamiltonian_path.svg.png.webp","url":"Path_(graph_theory)"}
