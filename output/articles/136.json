{"title":"8-simplex honeycomb","summary":"In eighth-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the 8-simplex honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). The tessellation fills space by 8-simplex, rectified 8-simplex, birectified 8-simplex, and trirectified 8-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 1:1:1:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"8-simplex_honeycomb"}
