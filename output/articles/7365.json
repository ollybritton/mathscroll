{"title":"Homological integration","summary":"In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and geometric measure theory, homological integration or geometric integration is a method for extending the notion of the integral to manifolds.  Rather than functions or differential forms, the integral is defined over currents on a manifold.","image":"b040433cb8e623885fa58ed78cdfc8812ca4faeb.svg","url":"Homological_integration"}
