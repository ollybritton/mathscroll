{"title":"Gauss–Codazzi equations","summary":"In Riemannian geometry and pseudo-Riemannian geometry, the Gauss–Codazzi equations (also called the Gauss–Codazzi–Weingarten-Mainardi equations or Gauss–Peterson–Codazzi formulas[1]) are fundamental formulas which link together the induced metric and second fundamental form of a submanifold of (or immersion into) a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold.","image":"1b2884dca72f8f2df027ef4de88b7df66a3a11e5.svg","url":"Gauss–Codazzi_equations"}
