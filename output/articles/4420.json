{"title":"Doob decomposition theorem","summary":"In the theory of stochastic processes in discrete time, a part of the mathematical theory of probability, the Doob decomposition theorem gives a unique decomposition of every adapted and integrable stochastic process as the sum of a martingale and a predictable process (or \"drift\") starting at zero. The theorem was proved by and is named for Joseph L. Doob.[1]","image":"6bb8743f7565082ed1a9ee0490d9d71be82eafaa.svg","url":"Doob_decomposition_theorem"}
