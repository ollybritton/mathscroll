{"title":"Bass–Serre theory","summary":"Bass–Serre theory is a part of the mathematical subject of group theory that deals with analyzing the algebraic structure of groups acting by automorphisms on simplicial trees. The theory relates group actions on trees with decomposing groups as iterated applications of the operations of free product with amalgamation and HNN extension, via the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups. Bass–Serre theory can be regarded as one-dimensional version of the orbifold theory.","image":"3d44a4cb2ccae41d74ca061b770f68f40a09ee23.svg","url":"Bass–Serre_theory"}
