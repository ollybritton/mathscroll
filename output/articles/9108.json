{"title":"Learning with errors","summary":"In cryptography, Learning with errors (LWE) is a mathematical problem that is widely used in cryptography to create secure encryption algorithms.[1] It is based on the idea of representing secret information as a set of equations with errors. In other words, LWE is a way to hide the value of a secret by introducing noise to it.[2] In more technical terms, it refers to the computational problem of inferring a linear n {\\displaystyle n} -ary function f {\\displaystyle f} over a finite ring from given samples y i = f ( x i ) {\\displaystyle y_{i}=f(\\mathbf {x} _{i})} some of which may be erroneous. The LWE problem is conjectured to be hard to solve,[1] and thus to be useful in cryptography.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Learning_with_errors"}
