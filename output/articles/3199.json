{"title":"Congruence-permutable algebra","summary":"In universal algebra, a congruence-permutable algebra is an algebra whose congruences commute under composition. This symmetry has several equivalent characterizations, which lend to the analysis of such algebras. Many familiar varieties of algebras, such as the variety of groups, consist of congruence-permutable algebras, but some, like the variety of lattices, have members that are not congruence-permutable.","image":"0795cc96c75d81520a120482662b90f024c9a1a1.svg","url":"Congruence-permutable_algebra"}
