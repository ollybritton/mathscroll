{"title":"Permutation polynomial","summary":"In mathematics, a permutation polynomial (for a given ring) is a polynomial that acts as a permutation of the elements of the ring, i.e. the map x â†¦ g ( x ) {\\displaystyle x\\mapsto g(x)} is a bijection.  In case the ring is a finite field, the Dickson polynomials, which are closely related to the Chebyshev polynomials, provide examples. Over a finite field, every function, so in particular every permutation of the elements of that field, can be written as a polynomial function.","image":"55bf6228e3c9a6979c385e32e7cfdea670b48bc8.svg","url":"Permutation_polynomial"}
