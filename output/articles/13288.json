{"title":"Reflexive sheaf","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a reflexive sheaf is a coherent sheaf that is isomorphic to its second dual (as a sheaf of modules) via the canonical map. The second dual of a coherent sheaf is called the reflexive hull of the sheaf. A basic example of a reflexive sheaf is a locally free sheaf of finite rank and, in practice, a reflexive sheaf is thought of as a kind of a vector bundle modulo some singularity. The notion is important both in scheme theory and complex algebraic geometry.","image":"66ccddf90fcb68264052fcae61c0c6126118d7b7.svg","url":"Reflexive_sheaf"}
