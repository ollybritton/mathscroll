{"title":"Snake lemma","summary":"The snake lemma is a tool used in mathematics, particularly homological algebra, to  construct long exact sequences. The snake lemma is valid in every abelian category and is a crucial tool in homological algebra and its applications, for instance in algebraic topology. Homomorphisms constructed with its help are generally called connecting homomorphisms.","image":"Snake_lemma_origin.svg.png.webp","url":"Snake_lemma"}
