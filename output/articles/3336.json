{"title":"Continuum (set theory)","summary":"In the mathematical field of set theory, the continuum means the real numbers, or the corresponding (infinite) cardinal number, denoted by c {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {c}}} .[1][2] Georg Cantor proved that the cardinality c {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {c}}} is larger than the smallest infinity, namely, ℵ 0 {\\displaystyle \\aleph _{0}} . He also proved that c {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {c}}} is equal to 2 ℵ 0 {\\displaystyle 2^{\\aleph _{0}}\\!} , the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers.","image":"b21924b960341255be18e538e51404718f29cbc0.svg","url":"Continuum_(set_theory)"}
