{"title":"K-trivial set","summary":"In mathematics, a set of natural numbers is called a K-trivial set if its initial segments viewed as binary strings are easy to describe: the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity is as low as possible, close to that of a computable set. Solovay proved in 1975 that a set can be K-trivial without being computable.","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"K-trivial_set"}
