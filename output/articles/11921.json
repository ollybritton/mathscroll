{"title":"Peano axioms","summary":"In mathematical logic, the Peano axioms, also known as the Dedekindâ€“Peano axioms or the Peano postulates, are axioms for the natural numbers presented by the 19th century Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of metamathematical investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether number theory is consistent and complete.","image":"682f44bd6a1ea39ecf1e21a8290b9d5b2f504505.svg","url":"Peano_axioms"}
