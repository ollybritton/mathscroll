{"title":"List of uniform polyhedra by Schwarz triangle","summary":"There are many relationships among the uniform polyhedra. The Wythoff construction is able to construct almost all of the uniform polyhedra from the acute and obtuse Schwarz triangles. The numbers that can be used for the sides of a non-dihedral acute or obtuse Schwarz triangle that does not necessarily lead to only degenerate uniform polyhedra are 2, 3, 3/2, 4, 4/3, 5, 5/2, 5/3, and 5/4 (but numbers with numerator 4 and those with numerator 5 may not occur together). (4/2 can also be used, but only leads to degenerate uniform polyhedra as 4 and 2 have a common factor.) There are 44 such Schwarz triangles (5 with tetrahedral symmetry, 7 with octahedral symmetry and 32 with icosahedral symmetry), which, together with the infinite family of dihedral Schwarz triangles, can form almost all of the non-degenerate uniform polyhedra. Many degenerate uniform polyhedra, with completely coincident vertices, edges, or faces, may also be generated by the Wythoff construction, and those that arise from Schwarz triangles not using 4/2 are also given in the tables below along with their non-degenerate counterparts. Reflex Schwarz triangles have not been included, as they simply create duplicates or degenerates; however, a few are mentioned outside the tables due to their application to three of the snub polyhedra.","image":"Degenerate_uniform_polyhedra_vertex_figures.png.webp","url":"List_of_uniform_polyhedra_by_Schwarz_triangle"}
