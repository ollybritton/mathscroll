{"title":"Chebfun","summary":"Chebfun is a free/open-source software system written in MATLAB for numerical computation with functions of a real variable.  It is based on the idea of overloading MATLAB's commands for vectors and matrices to analogous commands for functions and operators.  Thus, for example, whereas the SUM command in MATLAB adds up the elements of a vector, the SUM command in Chebfun evaluates a definite integral.  Similarly the backslash command in MATLAB becomes a Chebfun command for solving differential equations.[1][2][3][4][5]","image":"Cheblogo.png.webp","url":"Chebfun"}
