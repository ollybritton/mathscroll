{"title":"Pettis integral","summary":"In mathematics, the Pettis integral or Gelfandâ€“Pettis integral, named after Israel M. Gelfand and Billy James Pettis, extends the definition of the Lebesgue integral to vector-valued functions on a measure space, by exploiting duality. The integral was introduced by Gelfand for the case when the measure space is an interval with Lebesgue measure. The integral is also called the weak integral in contrast to the Bochner integral, which is the strong integral.","image":"8fade5c0c2160bfde6db0fab2873827fb903f2db.svg","url":"Pettis_integral"}
