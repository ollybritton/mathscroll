{"title":"Constructible set (topology)","summary":"In topology, constructible sets are a class of subsets of a topological space that have a relatively \"simple\" structure. They are used particularly in algebraic geometry and related fields. A key result known as Chevalley's theorem in algebraic geometry shows that the image of a constructible set is constructible for an important class of mappings (more specifically morphisms) of algebraic varieties (or more generally schemes). In addition, a large number of \"local\" geometric properties of schemes, morphisms and sheaves are (locally) constructible. Constructible sets also feature in the definition of various types of constructible sheaves in algebraic geometry and intersection cohomology.","image":"1cc6b75e09a8aa3f04d8584b11db534f88fb56bd.svg","url":"Constructible_set_(topology)"}
