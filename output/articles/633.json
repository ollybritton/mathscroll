{"title":"Alias method","summary":"In computing, the alias method is a family of efficient algorithms for sampling from a discrete probability distribution, published in 1974 by A. J. Walker.[1][2] That is, it returns integer values 1 ≤ i ≤ n according to some arbitrary probability distribution pi.  The algorithms typically use O(n log n) or O(n) preprocessing time, after which random values can be drawn from the distribution in O(1) time.[3]","image":"Alias_Table.png.webp","url":"Alias_method"}
