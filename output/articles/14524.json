{"title":"Slow manifold","summary":"In mathematics, the slow manifold of an equilibrium point of a dynamical system occurs as the most common example of a center manifold.  One of the main methods of simplifying dynamical systems, is to reduce the dimension of the system to that of the slow manifoldâ€”center manifold theory rigorously justifies the modelling.[1][2]  For example, some global and regional models of the atmosphere or oceans resolve the so-called quasi-geostrophic flow dynamics on the slow manifold of the atmosphere/oceanic dynamics,[3] and is thus crucial to forecasting with a climate model.","image":"a9dab55f713f3bfc1c053a764316c6cf60bc67e1.svg","url":"Slow_manifold"}
