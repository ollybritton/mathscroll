{"title":"Guillotine partition","summary":"Guillotine partition is the process of partitioning a rectilinear polygon, possibly containing some holes, into rectangles, using only guillotine-cuts. A guillotine-cut (also called an edge-to-edge cut) is a straight bisecting line going from one edge of an existing polygon to the opposite edge, similarly to a paper guillotine.","image":"CuttingStockGuillotine.png.webp","url":"Guillotine_partition"}
