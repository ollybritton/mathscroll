{"title":"Bapat–Beg theorem","summary":"In probability theory, the Bapat–Beg theorem gives the joint probability distribution of order statistics of independent but not necessarily identically distributed random variables in terms of the cumulative distribution functions of the random variables. Ravindra Bapat and Beg published the theorem in 1989,[1] though they did not offer a proof. A simple proof was offered by Hande in 1994.[2]","image":"d67872301909a9d739e265252ad0c7339cead069.svg","url":"Bapat–Beg_theorem"}
