{"title":"Triangular orthobicupola","summary":"In geometry, the triangular orthobicupola is one of the Johnson solids (J27). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by attaching two triangular cupolas (J3) along their bases. It has an equal number of squares and triangles at each vertex; however, it is not vertex-transitive. It is also called an anticuboctahedron, twisted cuboctahedron or disheptahedron. It is also a canonical polyhedron.","image":"Triangular_orthobicupola.png.webp","url":"Triangular_orthobicupola"}
