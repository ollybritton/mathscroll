{"title":"Gelfand ring","summary":"In mathematics, a Gelfand ring is an associative ring R with identity such that if I and J are distinct right ideals then there are elements i and j such that iRj=0, i is not in I, and j is not in J.   Mulvey (1979) introduced them as rings for which one could prove a generalization of Gelfand duality, and named them after Israel Gelfand.[1]","image":"3b66098049afaaf6343d592243076d9a5d38209d.svg","url":"Gelfand_ring"}
