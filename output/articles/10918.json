{"title":"Nakano vanishing theorem","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in the study of vector bundles over complex Kähler manifolds, the Nakano vanishing theorem, sometimes called the Akizuki–Nakano vanishing theorem, generalizes the Kodaira vanishing theorem.[1][2][3] Given a compact complex manifold M with a holomorphic line bundle F over M, the Nakano vanishing theorem provides a condition on when the cohomology groups H q ( M ; Ω p ( F ) ) {\\textstyle H^{q}(M;\\Omega ^{p}(F))} equal zero. Here, Ω p ( F ) {\\textstyle \\Omega ^{p}(F)} denotes the sheaf of holomorphic (p,0)-forms taking values on F. The theorem states that, if the first Chern class of F is negative,","image":"25596679325e7e8cb7e69e078524e6e3475d235d.svg","url":"Nakano_vanishing_theorem"}
