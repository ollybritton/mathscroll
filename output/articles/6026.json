{"title":"Gelfand–Naimark theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Gelfand–Naimark theorem states that an arbitrary C*-algebra A is isometrically *-isomorphic to a C*-subalgebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space.  This result was proven by Israel Gelfand and Mark Naimark in 1943 and was a significant point in the development of the theory of C*-algebras since it established the possibility of considering a C*-algebra as an abstract algebraic entity without reference to particular realizations as an operator algebra.","image":"a95081fda4ca534e0dc15c765c9b4e604628c6c7.svg","url":"Gelfand–Naimark_theorem"}
