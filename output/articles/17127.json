{"title":"Zariski's main theorem","summary":"In algebraic geometry, Zariski's main theorem, proved by Oscar ZariskiÂ (1943), is a statement about the structure of birational morphisms stating roughly that there is only one branch at any normal point of a variety. It is the special case of Zariski's connectedness theorem when the two varieties are birational.","image":"b1b0c1c5fc5f0953d7c887515f274ebd305d914a.svg","url":"Zariski's_main_theorem"}
