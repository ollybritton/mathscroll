{"title":"Parameshvara Nambudiri","summary":"Vatasseri Parameshvara Nambudiri (c. 1380â€“1460)[1]  was a major Indian mathematician and astronomer of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama. He was also an astrologer. Parameshvara was a proponent of observational astronomy in medieval India and he himself had made a series of eclipse observations to verify the accuracy of the computational methods then in use. Based on his eclipse observations, Parameshvara proposed several corrections to the astronomical parameters which had been in use since the times of Aryabhata. The computational scheme based on the revised set of parameters has come to be known as the Drgganita or Drig system. Parameshvara was also a prolific writer on matters relating to astronomy. At least 25 manuscripts have been identified as being authored by Parameshvara.[1]","image":"8b93fef529798879eebd76c29399353c6cee596c.svg","url":"Parameshvara_Nambudiri"}
