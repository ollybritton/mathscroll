{"title":"Jacobi coordinates","summary":"In the theory of many-particle systems, Jacobi coordinates often are used to simplify the mathematical formulation.  These coordinates are particularly common in treating polyatomic molecules and chemical reactions,[3] and in celestial mechanics.[4] An algorithm for generating the Jacobi coordinates for N bodies may be based upon binary trees.[5] In words, the algorithm is described as follows:[5]","image":"Two-body_Jacobi_coordinates.JPG.webp","url":"Jacobi_coordinates"}
