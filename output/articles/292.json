{"title":"Abstract analytic number theory","summary":"Abstract analytic number theory is a branch of mathematics which takes the ideas and techniques of classical analytic number theory and applies them to a variety of different mathematical fields. The classical prime number theorem serves as a prototypical example, and the emphasis is on abstract asymptotic distribution results. The theory was invented and developed by mathematicians such as John Knopfmacher and Arne Beurling in the twentieth century.","image":"70b4e6787d129ad7374a572e2d5e1631b7c3eac5.svg","url":"Abstract_analytic_number_theory"}
