{"title":"Derived noncommutative algebraic geometry","summary":"In mathematics, derived noncommutative algebraic geometry,[1] the derived version of noncommutative algebraic geometry, is the geometric study of derived categories and related constructions of triangulated categories using categorical tools. Some basic examples include the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth variety, D b ( X ) {\\displaystyle D^{b}(X)} , called its derived category, or the derived category of perfect complexes on an algebraic variety, denoted D perf ( X ) {\\displaystyle D_{\\operatorname {perf} }(X)} . For instance, the derived category of coherent sheaves D b ( X ) {\\displaystyle D^{b}(X)} on a smooth projective variety can be used as an invariant of the underlying variety for many cases (if X {\\displaystyle X} has an ample (anti-)canonical sheaf). Unfortunately, studying derived categories as geometric objects of themselves does not have a standardized name.","image":"1c58d10abfdb321eca303483f4e30bdb74f18cc7.svg","url":"Derived_noncommutative_algebraic_geometry"}
