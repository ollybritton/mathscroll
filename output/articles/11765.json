{"title":"Parabolic coordinates","summary":"Parabolic coordinates are a two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system in which the coordinate lines are confocal parabolas. A three-dimensional version of parabolic coordinates is obtained by rotating the two-dimensional system about the symmetry axis of the parabolas.","image":"Parabolic_coords.svg.png.webp","url":"Parabolic_coordinates"}
