{"title":"Heptagonal triangle","summary":"A heptagonal triangle is an obtuse scalene triangle whose vertices coincide with the first, second, and fourth vertices of a regular heptagon (from an arbitrary starting vertex). Thus its sides coincide with one side and the adjacent shorter and longer diagonals of the regular heptagon. All heptagonal triangles are similar (have the same shape), and so they are collectively known as the heptagonal triangle. Its angles have measures π / 7 , 2 π / 7 , {\\displaystyle \\pi /7,2\\pi /7,} and 4 π / 7 , {\\displaystyle 4\\pi /7,} and it is the only triangle with angles in the ratios 1:2:4. The heptagonal triangle has various remarkable properties.","image":"9b38f135e4a12264ac748c5657db76596d39feaa.svg","url":"Heptagonal_triangle"}
