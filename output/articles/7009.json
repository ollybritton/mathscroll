{"title":"Held–Karp algorithm","summary":"The Held–Karp algorithm, also called Bellman–Held–Karp algorithm, is a dynamic programming algorithm proposed in 1962 independently by Bellman[1] and by Held and Karp[2] to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP), in which the input is a distance matrix between a set of cities, and the goal is to find a minimum-length tour that visits each city exactly once before returning to the starting point. It finds the exact solution to this problem, and to several related problems including the Hamiltonian cycle problem, in exponential time.","image":"e3e6b15e92183431bb62b787fcdcbdcbe8b40234.svg","url":"Held–Karp_algorithm"}
