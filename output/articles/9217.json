{"title":"Leray–Schauder degree","summary":"In mathematics, the Leray–Schauder degree is an extension of the degree of a base point preserving continuous map between spheres ( S n , ∗ ) → ( S n , ∗ ) {\\displaystyle (S^{n},*)\\to (S^{n},*)} or equivalently to a boundary sphere preserving continuous maps between balls ( B n , S n − 1 ) → ( B n , S n − 1 ) {\\displaystyle (B^{n},S^{n-1})\\to (B^{n},S^{n-1})} to boundary sphere preserving maps between balls in a Banach space f : ( B ( V ) , S ( V ) ) → ( B ( V ) , S ( V ) ) {\\displaystyle f:(B(V),S(V))\\to (B(V),S(V))} , assuming that the map is of the form f = i d − C {\\displaystyle f=id-C} where i d {\\displaystyle id} is the identity map and C {\\displaystyle C} is some compact map (i.e. mapping bounded sets to sets whose closure is compact).[1]","image":"f87bd5805d52e82d56b928c093686febfe4c99f4.svg","url":"Leray–Schauder_degree"}
