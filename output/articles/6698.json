{"title":"Gyroelongated square bicupola","summary":"In geometry, the gyroelongated square bicupola is one of the Johnson solids (J45). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a square bicupola (J28 or J29) by inserting an octagonal antiprism between its congruent halves.","image":"Gyroelongated_square_bicupola.png.webp","url":"Gyroelongated_square_bicupola"}
