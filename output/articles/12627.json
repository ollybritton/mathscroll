{"title":"Projective vector field","summary":"A projective vector field (projective) is a smooth vector field on a semi Riemannian manifold (p.ex. spacetime) M {\\displaystyle M} whose flow preserves the geodesic structure of M {\\displaystyle M} without necessarily preserving the affine parameter of any geodesic.  More intuitively, the flow of the projective maps geodesics smoothly into geodesics without preserving the affine parameter.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Projective_vector_field"}
