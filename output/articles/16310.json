{"title":"Ultragraph C*-algebra","summary":"In mathematics, an ultragraph C*-algebra is a universal C*-algebra generated by partial isometries on a collection of Hilbert spaces constructed from the ultragraph[1]pg 6-7. These C*-algebras were created in order to simultaneously generalize the classes of graph C*-algebras and Exelâ€“Laca algebras, giving a unified framework for studying these objects.[1] This is because every graph can be encoded as an ultragraph, and similarly, every infinite graph giving an Exel-Laca algebras can also be encoded as an ultragraph.","image":"1903077da5c7650b90226932cc47d7e56ecb6792.svg","url":"Ultragraph_C*-algebra"}
