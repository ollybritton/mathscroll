{"title":"Filter quantifier","summary":"In mathematics, a filter on a set X {\\displaystyle X} informally gives a notion of which subsets A âŠ† X {\\displaystyle A\\subseteq X} are \"large\". Filter quantifiers are a type of logical quantifier which, informally, say whether or not a statement is true for \"most\" elements of X . {\\displaystyle X.} Such quantifiers are often used in combinatorics, model theory (such as when dealing with ultraproducts), and in other fields of mathematical logic where (ultra)filters are used.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Filter_quantifier"}
