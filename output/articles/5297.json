{"title":"Fast Walsh–Hadamard transform","summary":"In computational mathematics, the Hadamard ordered fast Walsh–Hadamard transform (FWHTh) is an efficient algorithm to compute the Walsh–Hadamard transform (WHT).  A naive implementation of the WHT of order n = 2 m {\\displaystyle n=2^{m}} would have a computational complexity of O( n 2 {\\displaystyle n^{2}} ).  The FWHTh requires only n log ⁡ n {\\displaystyle n\\log n} additions or subtractions.","image":"ab14407b66fdd78b64c1eeec8dff77a7df81b101.svg","url":"Fast_Walsh–Hadamard_transform"}
