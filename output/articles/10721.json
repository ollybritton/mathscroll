{"title":"Morse homology","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in the field of differential topology, Morse homology is a homology theory defined for any smooth manifold.  It is constructed using the smooth structure and an auxiliary metric on the manifold, but turns out to be topologically invariant, and is in fact isomorphic to singular homology.  Morse homology also serves as a model for the various infinite-dimensional generalizations known as Floer homology theories.","image":"a230d05990654b0fdcc68c1987f0cc6a27ead28c.svg","url":"Morse_homology"}
