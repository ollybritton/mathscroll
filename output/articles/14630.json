{"title":"Sobolev mapping","summary":"In mathematics, a Sobolev mapping is a mapping between manifolds which has smoothness in some sense. Sobolev mappings appear naturally in manifold-constrained problems in the calculus of variations and partial differential equations, including the theory of harmonic maps.","image":"f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd.svg","url":"Sobolev_mapping"}
