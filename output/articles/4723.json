{"title":"Elementary matrix","summary":"In mathematics, an elementary matrix is a matrix which differs from the identity matrix by one single elementary row operation. The elementary matrices generate the general linear group GLn(F) when F is a field. Left multiplication (pre-multiplication) by an elementary matrix represents elementary row operations, while right multiplication (post-multiplication) represents elementary column operations.","image":"e57e874f3273a0c16cd09eef2bd2fab0d5f78230.svg","url":"Elementary_matrix"}
