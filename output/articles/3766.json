{"title":"Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition","summary":"Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition is an algorithm for solving linear programming problems with special structure.  It was originally developed by George Dantzig and Philip Wolfe and initially published in 1960.[1] Many texts on linear programming have sections dedicated to discussing this decomposition algorithm.[2][3][4][5][6][7]","image":"DW_Block_Angular_Matrix.jpg.webp","url":"Dantzig–Wolfe_decomposition"}
