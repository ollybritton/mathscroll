{"title":"Order-5 cubic honeycomb","summary":"In hyperbolic geometry, the order-5 cubic honeycomb is one of four compact regular space-filling tessellations (or honeycombs) in hyperbolic 3-space. With Schl√§fli symbol {4,3,5}, it has five cubes {4,3}  around each edge, and 20 cubes around each vertex. It is dual with the order-4 dodecahedral honeycomb.","image":"H3_435_CC_center.png.webp","url":"Order-5_cubic_honeycomb"}
