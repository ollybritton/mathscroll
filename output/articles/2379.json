{"title":"Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem (also written as the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem) is the main local existence and uniqueness theorem for analytic partial differential equations associated with Cauchy initial value problems. A special case was proven by Augustin Cauchy (1842), and the full result by Sofya Kovalevskaya (1874).","image":"e45676c70a499b430aee5015405602f373ba1561.svg","url":"Cauchy–Kowalevski_theorem"}
