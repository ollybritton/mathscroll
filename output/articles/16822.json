{"title":"Weil cohomology theory","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a Weil cohomology or Weil cohomology theory is a cohomology satisfying certain axioms concerning the interplay of algebraic cycles and cohomology groups. The name is in honor of Andr√© Weil.  Any Weil cohomology theory factors uniquely through the category of Chow motives, but the category of Chow motives itself is not a Weil cohomology theory, since it is not an abelian category.","image":"0a0b5799bdf4f2be8a55b5686568c252fb68b61b.svg","url":"Weil_cohomology_theory"}
