{"title":"Limit cardinal","summary":"In mathematics, limit cardinals are certain cardinal numbers. A cardinal number λ is a weak limit cardinal if  λ is neither a successor cardinal nor zero. This means that one cannot \"reach\" λ from another cardinal by repeated successor operations. These cardinals are sometimes called simply \"limit cardinals\" when the context is clear.","image":"721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1.svg","url":"Limit_cardinal"}
