{"title":"Symmetry","summary":"Symmetry (from Ancient Greek: συμμετρία symmetria \"agreement in dimensions, due proportion, arrangement\")[1] in everyday language refers to a sense of harmonious and beautiful proportion and balance.[2][3][lower-alpha 1] In mathematics, \"symmetry\" has a more precise definition, and is usually used to refer to an object that is invariant under some transformations; including translation, reflection, rotation or scaling. Although these two meanings of \"symmetry\" can sometimes be told apart, they are intricately related, and hence are discussed together in this article.","image":"Asymmetric_(PSF).svg.png.webp","url":"Symmetry"}
