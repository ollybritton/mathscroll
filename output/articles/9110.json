{"title":"Least-squares function approximation","summary":"In mathematics, least squares function approximation applies the principle of least squares to function approximation, by means of a weighted sum of other functions. The best approximation can be defined as that which minimizes the difference between the original function and the approximation; for a least-squares approach the quality of the approximation is measured in terms of the squared differences between the two.","image":"2730998b2ab2ab75c4290b858ae375d2c0f5a98f.svg","url":"Least-squares_function_approximation"}
