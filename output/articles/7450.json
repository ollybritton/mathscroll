{"title":"Huisken's monotonicity formula","summary":"In differential geometry, Huisken's monotonicity formula states that, if an n-dimensional surface in (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space undergoes the mean curvature flow, then its convolution with an appropriately scaled and time-reversed heat kernel is non-increasing.[1][2] The result is named after Gerhard Huisken, who published it in 1990.[3]","image":"ed6ced2973d763caef884d0b958deaca07afc01f.svg","url":"Huisken's_monotonicity_formula"}
