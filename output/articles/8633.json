{"title":"Kazhdan's property (T)","summary":"In mathematics, a locally compact topological group G has property (T) if the trivial representation is an isolated point in its unitary dual equipped with the Fell topology. Informally, this means that if G acts unitarily on a Hilbert space and has \"almost invariant vectors\", then it has a nonzero invariant vector. The formal definition, introduced by David Kazhdan (1967), gives this a precise, quantitative meaning.","image":"2fb458792f47d5c64e4a76c06330bdfd2bbed4bc.svg","url":"Kazhdan's_property_(T)"}
