{"title":"Superellipsoid","summary":"In mathematics, a superellipsoid (or super-ellipsoid) is a solid whose horizontal sections are superellipses (Lamé curves) with the same squareness parameter ϵ 2 {\\displaystyle \\epsilon _{2}} , and whose vertical sections through the center are superellipses with the squareness parameter ϵ 1 {\\displaystyle \\epsilon _{1}} . It is a generalization of an ellipsoid, which is a special case when ϵ 1 = ϵ 2 = 1 {\\displaystyle \\epsilon _{1}=\\epsilon _{2}=1} .[2]","image":"5c7ce0a2b401d02627ae392bfb876b6e765fec7b.svg","url":"Superellipsoid"}
