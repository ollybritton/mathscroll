{"title":"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences","summary":"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences is a 1966 textbook by mathematician Mary L. Boas intended to develop skills in mathematical problem solving needed for junior to senior-graduate courses in engineering, physics, and chemistry. The book provides a comprehensive survey of analytic techniques and provides careful statements of important theorems while omitting most detailed proofs. Each section contains a large number of problems, with selected answers. Numerical computational approaches using computers are outside the scope of the book.","image":"Mathematical_Methods_in_the_Physical_Sciences.jpg.webp","url":"Mathematical_Methods_in_the_Physical_Sciences"}
