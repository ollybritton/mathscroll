{"title":"Meijer G-function","summary":"In mathematics, the G-function was introduced by Cornelis Simon Meijer (1936) as a very general function intended to include most of the known special functions as particular cases. This was not the only attempt of its kind: the generalized hypergeometric function and the MacRobert E-function had the same aim, but Meijer's G-function was able to include those as particular cases as well. The first definition was made by Meijer using a series; nowadays the accepted and more general definition is via a line integral in the complex plane, introduced in its full generality by Arthur Erdélyi in 1953.","image":"Plot_of_the_Meiger_G_function_G(((a_1%2C...%2Ca_n)%2C(a_n%2B1%2C...%2Ca_p))%2C((b_1%2C...%2Cb_m)%2C(b_m%2B1%2C...%2Cb_q))%2Cz)_input_((½)%2C())%2C((⅓)%2C())_in_the_complex_plane_from_-2-2i_to_2%2B2i.svg.png.webp","url":"Meijer_G-function"}
