{"title":"Skew and direct sums of permutations","summary":"In combinatorics, the skew sum and direct sum of permutations are two operations to combine shorter permutations into longer ones.  Given a permutation π of length m and the permutation σ of length n, the skew sum of π and σ is the permutation of length m + n defined by","image":"efa803515fdd8917c1a0d3705134d7e3b1410b00.svg","url":"Skew_and_direct_sums_of_permutations"}
