{"title":"Homotopical connectivity","summary":"In  algebraic topology, homotopical connectivity is a property describing a topological space based on the dimension of its holes. In general, low homotopical connectivity indicates that the space has at least one low-dimensional hole. The concept of n-connectedness generalizes the concepts of path-connectedness and simple connectedness.","image":"fc69bc97f152a11c5e75badbb8d41f9038d71b10.svg","url":"Homotopical_connectivity"}
