{"title":"Circuit complexity","summary":"In theoretical computer science, circuit complexity is a branch of computational complexity theory in which Boolean functions are classified according to the size or depth of the Boolean circuits that compute them. A related notion is the circuit complexity of a recursive language that is decided by a uniform family of circuits C 1 , C 2 , â€¦ {\\displaystyle C_{1},C_{2},\\ldots } (see below).","image":"49bbb013f6d1bb2c4c71f7d3f28ce36eafa4e68c.svg","url":"Circuit_complexity"}
