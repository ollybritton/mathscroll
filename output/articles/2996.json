{"title":"Complex-oriented cohomology theory","summary":"In algebraic topology, a complex-orientable cohomology theory is a multiplicative cohomology theory E such that the restriction map E 2 ( C P ∞ ) → E 2 ( C P 1 ) {\\displaystyle E^{2}(\\mathbb {C} \\mathbf {P} ^{\\infty })\\to E^{2}(\\mathbb {C} \\mathbf {P} ^{1})} is surjective. An element of E 2 ( C P ∞ ) {\\displaystyle E^{2}(\\mathbb {C} \\mathbf {P} ^{\\infty })} that restricts to the canonical generator of the reduced theory E ~ 2 ( C P 1 ) {\\displaystyle {\\widetilde {E}}^{2}(\\mathbb {C} \\mathbf {P} ^{1})} is called a complex orientation. The notion is central to Quillen's work relating cohomology to formal group laws.","image":"2c665f01c309de453fa97f18d18387caee0f50ec.svg","url":"Complex-oriented_cohomology_theory"}
