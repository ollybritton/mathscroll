{"title":"Elliptic integral","summary":"In integral calculus, an elliptic integral is one of a number of related functions defined as the value of certain integrals, which were first studied by Giulio Fagnano and Leonhard Euler (c.â€‰1750). Their name originates from their originally arising in connection with the problem of finding the arc length of an ellipse.","image":"066d7c985940c1aa0b4458a9ce2abafe1c3c6fcd.svg","url":"Elliptic_integral"}
