{"title":"Complex torus","summary":"In mathematics, a complex torus is a particular kind of complex manifold M whose underlying smooth manifold is a torus in the usual sense (i.e. the cartesian product of some number N circles). Here N must be the even number 2n, where n is the complex dimension of M.","image":"Lattice_torsion_points.svg.png.webp","url":"Complex_torus"}
