{"title":"Berlekamp's algorithm","summary":"In mathematics, particularly computational algebra, Berlekamp's algorithm is a well-known method for factoring polynomials over finite fields (also known as Galois fields).  The algorithm consists mainly of matrix reduction and polynomial GCD computations.  It was invented by Elwyn Berlekamp in 1967.  It was the dominant algorithm for solving the problem until the Cantorâ€“Zassenhaus algorithm  of 1981.  It is currently implemented in many well-known computer algebra systems.","image":"202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074.svg","url":"Berlekamp's_algorithm"}
