{"title":"Split interval","summary":"In topology, the split interval, or double arrow space, is a topological space that results from splitting each point in a closed interval into two adjacent points and giving the resulting ordered set the order topology.  It satisfies various interesting properties and serves as a useful counterexample in general topology.","image":"ec8b084960cd7376269275722a13702d8f6ea032.svg","url":"Split_interval"}
