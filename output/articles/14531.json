{"title":"Small-world network","summary":"A small-world network is a mathematical graph in which most nodes are not neighbors of one another, but the neighbors of any given node are likely to be neighbors of each other. Due to this, most neighboring nodes can be reached from every other node by a small number of hops or steps.[1]   Specifically, a small-world network is defined to be a network where the typical distance L between two randomly chosen nodes (the number of steps required) grows proportionally to the logarithm of the number of nodes N in the network, that is:[2]","image":"4923042aa0384aed8ab3b1c38bffb40a5a265109.svg","url":"Small-world_network"}
