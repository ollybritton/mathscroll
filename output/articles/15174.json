{"title":"Sturm separation theorem","summary":"In mathematics, in the field of ordinary differential equations, Sturm separation theorem, named after Jacques Charles Fran√ßois Sturm, describes the location of roots of solutions of  homogeneous second order linear differential equations. Basically the theorem states that given two linear independent solutions of such an equation the zeros of the two solutions are alternating.","image":"Airy_plot.svg.png.webp","url":"Sturm_separation_theorem"}
