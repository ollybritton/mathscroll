{"title":"Surgery theory","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in geometric topology, surgery theory is a collection of techniques used to produce one finite-dimensional manifold from another in a 'controlled' way, introduced by John MilnorÂ (1961). Milnor called this technique surgery, while Andrew Wallace called it spherical modification.[1] The \"surgery\" on a differentiable manifold M of dimension n = p + q + 1 {\\displaystyle n=p+q+1} , could be described as removing an imbedded sphere of dimension p from M.[2] Originally developed for differentiable (or, smooth) manifolds, surgery techniques also apply to piecewise linear (PL-) and topological manifolds.","image":"5561e053d00de48207e64e9f2eab22a5872d297e.svg","url":"Surgery_theory"}
