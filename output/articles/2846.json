{"title":"Coherent states in mathematical physics","summary":"Coherent states have been introduced in a physical context, first as quasi-classical states in quantum mechanics, then as the backbone of quantum optics and they are described in that spirit in the article Coherent states (see also[1]). However, they have generated a huge variety of generalizations, which have led to a tremendous amount of literature in mathematical physics. In this article, we sketch the main directions of research on this line. For further details, we refer to several existing surveys.[2][3][4]","image":"05e7997a023d268ca86fa9a0f5980e99bf582cb2.svg","url":"Coherent_states_in_mathematical_physics"}
