{"title":"Posterior probability","summary":"The posterior probability is a type of conditional probability that results from updating the prior probability with information summarized by the likelihood via an application of Bayes' rule.[1] From an epistemological perspective, the posterior probability contains everything there is to know about an uncertain proposition (such as a scientific hypothesis, or parameter values), given prior knowledge and a mathematical model describing the observations available at a particular time.[2] After the arrival of new information, the current posterior probability may serve as the prior in another round of Bayesian updating.[3]","image":"Bayes_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Posterior_probability"}
