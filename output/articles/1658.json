{"title":"Binomial coefficient","summary":"In mathematics, the binomial coefficients are the positive integers that occur as coefficients in the binomial theorem. Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers n ≥ k ≥ 0 and is written ( n k ) . {\\displaystyle {\\tbinom {n}{k}}.} It is the coefficient of the xk term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power (1 + x)n; this coefficient can be computed by the multiplicative formula","image":"39c7822635a8fa426d00ca72733ea1bd6fe90b01.svg","url":"Binomial_coefficient"}
