{"title":"Linear combination","summary":"In mathematics, a linear combination is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a constant and adding the results (e.g. a linear combination of x and y would be any expression of the form ax + by, where a and b are constants).[1][2][3][4] The concept of linear combinations is central to linear algebra and related fields of mathematics. Most of this article deals with linear combinations in the context of a vector space over a field, with some generalizations given at the end of the article.","image":"06a8dab6b20c2d8f396fac1847e39cc3e1a3e7dc.svg","url":"Linear_combination"}
