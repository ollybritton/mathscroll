{"title":"Peano kernel theorem","summary":"In numerical analysis, the Peano kernel theorem is a general result on error bounds for a wide class of numerical approximations (such as numerical quadratures), defined in terms of linear functionals. It is attributed to Giuseppe Peano.[1]","image":"fb6525110708dccb30881fc6f570e52533ceb424.svg","url":"Peano_kernel_theorem"}
