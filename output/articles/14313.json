{"title":"Shortcut model","summary":"An important question in statistical mechanics is the dependence of model behaviour on the dimension of the system. The shortcut model[1][2] was introduced in the course of studying this dependence. The model interpolates between discrete regular lattices of integer dimension.","image":"2e3428d62160244d51a9543da6075b9d68e60d5b.svg","url":"Shortcut_model"}
