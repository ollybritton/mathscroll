{"title":"Error detection and correction","summary":"In information theory and coding theory with applications in computer science and telecommunication, error detection and correction (EDAC) or error control are techniques that enable reliable delivery of digital data over unreliable communication channels. Many communication channels are subject to channel noise, and thus errors may be introduced during transmission from the source to a receiver. Error detection techniques allow detecting such errors, while error correction enables reconstruction of the original data in many cases.","image":"Reedâ€“Solomon_error_correction_Mona_Lisa_LroLrLasercomFig4.jpg.webp","url":"Error_detection_and_correction"}
