{"title":"Algebra over a field","summary":"In mathematics, an algebra over a field (often simply called an algebra) is a vector space equipped with a bilinear product. Thus, an algebra is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with operations of multiplication and addition and scalar multiplication by elements of a field and satisfying the axioms implied by \"vector space\" and \"bilinear\".[1]","image":"e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd.svg","url":"Algebra_over_a_field"}
