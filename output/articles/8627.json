{"title":"Kautz graph","summary":"The Kautz graph K M N + 1 {\\displaystyle K_{M}^{N+1}} is a directed graph of degree M {\\displaystyle M} and dimension N + 1 {\\displaystyle N+1} , which has ( M + 1 ) M N {\\displaystyle (M+1)M^{N}} vertices labeled by all possible strings s 0 ⋯ s N {\\displaystyle s_{0}\\cdots s_{N}} of length N + 1 {\\displaystyle N+1} which are composed of characters s i {\\displaystyle s_{i}} chosen from an alphabet A {\\displaystyle A} containing M + 1 {\\displaystyle M+1} distinct symbols, subject to the condition that adjacent characters in the string cannot be equal ( s i ≠ s i + 1 {\\displaystyle s_{i}\\neq s_{i+1}} ).","image":"650eff55a64ca473b63b21cf8bc6be54b92e3d7f.svg","url":"Kautz_graph"}
