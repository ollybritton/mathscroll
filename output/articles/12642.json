{"title":"Proof of Bertrand's postulate","summary":"In mathematics, Bertrand's postulate (actually now a theorem) states that for each n â‰¥ 2 {\\displaystyle n\\geq 2} there is a prime p {\\displaystyle p} such that n < p < 2 n {\\displaystyle n<p<2n} . First conjectured in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand,[1] it was first proven by Chebyshev, and a shorter but also advanced proof was given by Ramanujan.[2]","image":"e6bf67f9d06ca3af619657f8d20ee1322da77174.svg","url":"Proof_of_Bertrand's_postulate"}
