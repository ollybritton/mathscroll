{"title":"Fusion category","summary":"In mathematics, a fusion category is a category that is rigid, semisimple, k {\\displaystyle k} -linear, monoidal and has only finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects, such that the monoidal unit is simple. If the ground field k {\\displaystyle k} is algebraically closed, then the latter is equivalent to H o m ( 1 , 1 ) â‰… k {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Hom} (1,1)\\cong k} by Schur's lemma.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg","url":"Fusion_category"}
