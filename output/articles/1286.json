{"title":"Balian–Low theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Balian–Low theorem in Fourier analysis is named for Roger Balian and Francis E. Low. The theorem states that there is no well-localized window function (or Gabor atom) g either in time or frequency for an exact Gabor frame (Riesz Basis).","image":"f72af4047de3f92f6a18f0a43f941d9d5e04fb4c.svg","url":"Balian–Low_theorem"}
