{"title":"Constructible polygon","summary":"In mathematics, a constructible polygon is a regular polygon that can be constructed with compass and straightedge. For example, a regular pentagon is constructible with compass and straightedge while a regular heptagon is not. There are infinitely many constructible polygons, but only 31 with an odd number of sides are known.","image":"Pentagon_construct.gif","url":"Constructible_polygon"}
