{"title":"Constructible topology","summary":"In commutative algebra, the constructible topology on the spectrum Spec ⁡ ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Spec} (A)} of a commutative ring A {\\displaystyle A} is a topology where each closed set is the image of Spec ⁡ ( B ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Spec} (B)} in Spec ⁡ ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Spec} (A)} for some algebra B over A. An important feature of this construction is that the map Spec ⁡ ( B ) → Spec ⁡ ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Spec} (B)\\to \\operatorname {Spec} (A)} is a closed map with respect to the constructible topology.","image":"3a8f4adb35d44ab224c9cbc7ce5556dab64111aa.svg","url":"Constructible_topology"}
