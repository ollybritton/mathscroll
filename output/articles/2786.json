{"title":"Closure (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a subset of a given set is closed under an operation of the larger set if performing that operation on members of the subset always produces a member of that subset. For example, the natural numbers are closed under addition, but not under subtraction: 1 âˆ’ 2 is not a natural number, although both 1 and 2 are.","image":"abf3e597919d6ae699180ce66b51edbe14f3546a.svg","url":"Closure_(mathematics)"}
