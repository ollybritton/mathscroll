{"title":"Paraboloidal coordinates","summary":"Paraboloidal coordinates are three-dimensional orthogonal coordinates ( μ , ν , λ ) {\\displaystyle (\\mu ,\\nu ,\\lambda )} that generalize two-dimensional parabolic coordinates. They possess elliptic paraboloids as one-coordinate surfaces. As such, they should be distinguished from parabolic cylindrical coordinates and parabolic rotational coordinates, both of which are also generalizations of two-dimensional parabolic coordinates. The coordinate surfaces of the former are parabolic cylinders, and the coordinate surfaces of the latter are circular paraboloids.","image":"890e98332421a2f5e7d3a51fe6e51e6fb8b5127e.svg","url":"Paraboloidal_coordinates"}
