{"title":"Ramanujan graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of spectral graph theory, a Ramanujan graph is a regular graph whose spectral gap is almost as large as possible (see extremal graph theory). Such graphs are excellent spectral expanders. As Murty's survey paper notes, Ramanujan graphs \"fuse diverse branches of pure mathematics, namely, number theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry\". These graphs are indirectly named after Srinivasa Ramanujan; their name comes from the Ramanujanâ€“Petersson conjecture, which was used in a construction of some of these graphs.","image":"f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b.svg","url":"Ramanujan_graph"}
