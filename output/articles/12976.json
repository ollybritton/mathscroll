{"title":"Quine–McCluskey algorithm","summary":"The Quine–McCluskey algorithm (QMC), also known as the method of prime implicants, is a method used for minimization of Boolean functions that was developed by Willard V. Quine in 1952[1][2] and extended by Edward J. McCluskey in 1956.[3] As a general principle this approach had already been demonstrated by the logician Hugh McColl in 1878,[4][5][6] was proved by Archie Blake in 1937,[7][8][9][6] and was rediscovered by Edward W. Samson and Burton E. Mills in 1954[10][6] and by Raymond J. Nelson in 1955.[11][6] Also in 1955, Paul W. Abrahams and John G. Nordahl[12] as well as Albert A. Mullin and Wayne G. Kellner[13][14][15][16] proposed a decimal variant of the method.[17][14][15][16][18][19][20][21]","image":"QmcSearchGraph3_Ab%2Bc_svg.svg.png.webp","url":"Quine–McCluskey_algorithm"}
