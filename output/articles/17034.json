{"title":"Wu–Yang dictionary","summary":"In topology and high energy physics, the Wu–Yang dictionary refers to the mathematical identification that allows to translate back and forth between the concepts of gauge theory and those of differential geometry. It was devised by Tai Tsun Wu and C. N. Yang in 1975 when studying the relation between electromagnetism and fiber bundle theory.[1] This dictionary has been credited as bringing mathematics and theoretical physics closer together.[2]","image":"AharonovBohmEffect.svg.png.webp","url":"Wu–Yang_dictionary"}
