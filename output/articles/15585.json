{"title":"Term algebra","summary":"In universal algebra and mathematical logic, a term algebra is a freely generated algebraic structure over a given signature.[1][2] For example, in a signature consisting of a single binary operation, the term algebra over a set X of variables is exactly the free magma generated by X. Other synonyms for the notion include absolutely free algebra and anarchic algebra.[3]","image":"38a7dcde9730ef0853809fefc18d88771f95206c.svg","url":"Term_algebra"}
