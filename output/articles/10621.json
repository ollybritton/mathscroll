{"title":"Moffatt eddies","summary":"Moffatt eddies are sequences of eddies that develop in corners bounded by plane walls (or sometimes between a wall and a free surface) due to an arbitrary disturbance acting at asymptotically large distances from the corner. Although the source of motion is the arbitrary disturbance at large distances, the eddies develop quite independently and thus solution of these eddies emerges from an eigenvalue problem, a self-similar solution of the second kind.","image":"ed8396fdc359fb06c93722137c959e7496e47ed6.svg","url":"Moffatt_eddies"}
