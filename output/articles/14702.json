{"title":"Spaghetti plot","summary":"A spaghetti plot (also known as a spaghetti chart, spaghetti diagram, or spaghetti model) is a method of viewing data to visualize possible flows through systems.  Flows depicted in this manner appear like noodles, hence the coining of this term.[1]  This method of statistics was first used to track routing through factories.  Visualizing flow in this manner can reduce inefficiency within the flow of a system.  In regards to animal populations and weather buoys drifting through the ocean, they are drawn to study distribution and migration patterns.  Within meteorology, these diagrams can help determine confidence in a specific weather forecast, as well as positions and intensities of high and low pressure systems.  They are composed of deterministic forecasts from atmospheric models or their various ensemble members.  Within medicine, they can illustrate the effects of drugs on patients during drug trials.","image":"Nov192001h5spaghetti5640m.png.webp","url":"Spaghetti_plot"}
