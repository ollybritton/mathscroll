{"title":"Chandrasekhar–Page equations","summary":"Chandrasekhar–Page equations describe the wave function of the spin-½ massive particles, that resulted by seeking a separable solution to the Dirac equation in Kerr metric or Kerr–Newman metric. In 1976, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar showed that a separable solution can be obtained from the Dirac equation in Kerr metric.[1] Later, Don Page extended this work to Kerr–Newman metric, that is applicable to charged black holes.[2] In his paper, Page notices that N. Toop also derived his results independently, as informed to him by Chandrasekhar.","image":"c35238ca38fd99f569a25f9b0b84b0321b83fbb8.svg","url":"Chandrasekhar–Page_equations"}
