{"title":"Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin test","summary":"The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) test is a statistical measure to determine how suited data is for factor analysis. The test measures sampling adequacy for each variable in the model and the complete model. The statistic is a measure of the proportion of variance among variables that might be common variance. The higher the proportion, the higher the KMO-value, the more suited the data is to factor analysis.[1]","image":"b4329cbffb7865d58d0daa752004276a3de9e886.svg","url":"Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin_test"}
