{"title":"Sum coloring","summary":"In graph theory, a sum coloring of a graph is a labeling of its vertices by positive integers, with no two adjacent vertices having equal labels, that minimizes the sum of the labels. The minimum sum that can be achieved is called the chromatic sum of the graph.[1] Chromatic sums and sum coloring were introduced by Supowit in 1987 using non-graph-theoretic terminology,[2] and first studied in graph theoretic terms by Ewa Kubicka (independently of Supowit) in her 1989 doctoral thesis.[3]","image":"Tree_sum_coloring.svg.png.webp","url":"Sum_coloring"}
