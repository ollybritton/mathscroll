{"title":"Unknotting number","summary":"In the mathematical area of knot theory, the unknotting number of a knot is the minimum number of times the knot must be passed through itself (crossing switch) to untie it. If a knot has unknotting number n {\\displaystyle n} , then there exists a diagram of the knot which can be changed to unknot by switching n {\\displaystyle n} crossings.[1] The unknotting number of a knot is always less than half of its crossing number.[2]","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"Unknotting_number"}
