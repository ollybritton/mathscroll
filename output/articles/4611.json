{"title":"Edge contraction","summary":"In graph theory, an edge contraction is an operation that removes an edge from a graph while simultaneously merging the two vertices that it previously joined. Edge contraction is a fundamental operation in the theory of graph minors. Vertex identification is a less restrictive form of this operation.","image":"Edge_contraction_with_multiple_edges.svg.png.webp","url":"Edge_contraction"}
