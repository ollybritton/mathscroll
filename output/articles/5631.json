{"title":"Fractal derivative","summary":"In applied mathematics and mathematical analysis, the fractal derivative or Hausdorff derivative is a non-Newtonian generalization of the derivative dealing with the measurement of fractals, defined in fractal geometry. Fractal derivatives were created for the study of anomalous diffusion, by which traditional approaches fail to factor in the fractal nature of the media. A  fractal measure t is scaled according to tÎ±. Such a derivative is local, in contrast to the similarly applied fractional derivative. Fractal calculus is formulated as a generalized of standard calculus  [1]","image":"72bcc9cbf134e3823f5e87f41728c601a718fe30.svg","url":"Fractal_derivative"}
