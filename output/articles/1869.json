{"title":"Bornivorous set","summary":"In functional analysis, a subset of a real or complex vector space X {\\displaystyle X} that has an associated vector bornology B {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}} is called bornivorous and a bornivore if it absorbs every element of B . {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {B}}.} If X {\\displaystyle X} is a topological vector space (TVS) then a subset S {\\displaystyle S} of X {\\displaystyle X} is bornivorous if it is bornivorous with respect to the von-Neumann bornology of X {\\displaystyle X} .","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Bornivorous_set"}
