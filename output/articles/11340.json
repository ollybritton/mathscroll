{"title":"Octahedral-hexagonal tiling honeycomb","summary":"In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the octahedron-hexagonal tiling honeycomb is a paracompact uniform honeycomb, constructed from octahedron, hexagonal tiling, and trihexagonal tiling cells, in a rhombicuboctahedron vertex figure. It has a single-ring Coxeter diagram, , and is named by its two regular cells.","image":"CDel_label6.png.webp","url":"Octahedral-hexagonal_tiling_honeycomb"}
