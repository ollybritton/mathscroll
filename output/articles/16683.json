{"title":"Von Neumann algebra","summary":"In mathematics, a von Neumann algebra or W*-algebra is a *-algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that is closed in the weak operator topology and contains the identity operator. It is a special type of C*-algebra.","image":"016b7dd68f0a209dfb882c9779e5b1c4e690c46a.svg","url":"Von_Neumann_algebra"}
