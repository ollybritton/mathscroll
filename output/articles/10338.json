{"title":"Metabiaugmented dodecahedron","summary":"In geometry, the metabiaugmented dodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (J60). It can be viewed as a dodecahedron with two pentagonal pyramids (J2) attached to two faces that are separated by one face. (The two faces are not opposite, but not adjacent either.) When pyramids are attached to a dodecahedron in other ways, they may result in an augmented dodecahedron (J58), a parabiaugmented dodecahedron (J59), a triaugmented dodecahedron (J61), or even a pentakis dodecahedron if the faces are made to be irregular.","image":"Metabiaugmented_dodecahedron.png.webp","url":"Metabiaugmented_dodecahedron"}
