{"title":"Bass diffusion model","summary":"The Bass model or Bass diffusion model was developed by Frank Bass.  It consists of a simple differential equation that describes the process of how new products get adopted in a population. The model presents a rationale of how current adopters and potential adopters of a new product interact. The basic premise of the model is that adopters can be classified as innovators or as imitators, and the speed and timing of adoption depends on their degree of innovation and the degree of imitation among adopters. The Bass model has been widely used in forecasting, especially new products' sales forecasting and technology forecasting. Mathematically, the basic Bass diffusion is a Riccati equation with constant coefficients equivalent to Verhulst--Pearl Logistic growth.","image":"5593bdc6305ad9014fdaab971c68c2410f213c12.svg","url":"Bass_diffusion_model"}
