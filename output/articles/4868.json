{"title":"Enumeration reducibility","summary":"In computability theory and computational complexity theory, enumeration reducibility is a method of reduction that determines if there is some effective procedure for determining enumerability between sets of natural numbers. An enumeration in the context of e-reducibility is a listing of the elements in a particular set, or collection of items, though not necessarily ordered or complete.","image":"ffbfdba2f202c8b40ef937491ffff7dc97917840.svg","url":"Enumeration_reducibility"}
