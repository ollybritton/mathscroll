{"title":"Sparse grid","summary":"Sparse grids are numerical techniques to represent, integrate or interpolate high dimensional functions. They were originally developed by the Russian mathematician Sergey A. Smolyak, a student of Lazar Lyusternik, and are based on a sparse tensor product construction. Computer algorithms for efficient implementations of such grids were later developed by Michael Griebel and Christoph Zenger.","image":"829091f745070b9eb97a80244129025440a1cfac.svg","url":"Sparse_grid"}
