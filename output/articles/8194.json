{"title":"James' space","summary":"In the area of mathematics known as functional analysis, James' space is an important example in the theory of Banach spaces and commonly serves as useful counterexample to general statements concerning the structure of general Banach spaces. The space was first introduced in 1950 in a short paper by Robert C. James.[1]","image":"10d6ec962de5797ba4f161c40e66dca74ae95cc6.svg","url":"James'_space"}
