{"title":"Legendre moment","summary":"In mathematics, Legendre moments are a type of image moment and are achieved by using the Legendre polynomial.  Legendre moments are used in areas of image processing including: pattern and object recognition, image indexing, line fitting, feature extraction, edge detection, and texture analysis.[1]  Legendre moments have been studied as a means to reduce image moment calculation complexity by limiting the amount of information redundancy through approximation.[2]","image":"f588df2f9408fd993522e073ccb7fb91093a239d.svg","url":"Legendre_moment"}
