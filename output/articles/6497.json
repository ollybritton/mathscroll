{"title":"Graver basis","summary":"In applied mathematics, Graver bases enable iterative solutions of linear and various nonlinear integer programming problems in polynomial time.  They were introduced by Jack E. Graver.[1] Their connection to the theory of Gr√∂bner bases was discussed by Bernd Sturmfels.[2] The algorithmic theory of Graver bases and its application to integer programming is described by Shmuel Onn.[3][4]","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Graver_basis"}
