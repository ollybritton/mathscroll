{"title":"Notakto","summary":"Notakto is a tic-tac-toe variant, also known as neutral or impartial tic-tac-toe.[1][2] The game is a combination of the games tic-tac-toe and Nim,[1][3] played across one or several boards with both of the players playing the same piece (an \"X\" or cross). The game ends when all the boards contain a three-in-a-row of Xs,[4][5][6] at which point the player to have made the last move loses the game.[7] However, in this game, unlike tic-tac-toe, there will always be a player who wins any game of Notakto.[8]","image":"Three-board_Notakto.svg.png.webp","url":"Notakto"}
