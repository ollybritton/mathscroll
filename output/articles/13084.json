{"title":"Ran space","summary":"In mathematics, the Ran space (or Ran's space) of a topological space X is a topological space Ran ‚Å° ( X ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Ran} (X)} whose underlying set is the set of all nonempty finite subsets of X: for a metric space X the topology is induced by the Hausdorff distance. The notion is named after Ziv Ran.","image":"ca861be70a00baa7dc3cbc89388d43602abb37e3.svg","url":"Ran_space"}
