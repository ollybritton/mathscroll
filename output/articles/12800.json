{"title":"QR decomposition","summary":"In linear algebra, a QR decomposition, also known as a QR factorization or QU factorization, is a decomposition of a matrix A into a product A = QR of an orthonormal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R. QR decomposition is often used to solve the linear least squares problem and is the basis for a particular eigenvalue algorithm, the QR algorithm.","image":"d4bc683fc8c2ab81b7bd7729d3634d0ae007d704.svg","url":"QR_decomposition"}
