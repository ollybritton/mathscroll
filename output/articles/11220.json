{"title":"Normal extension","summary":"In abstract algebra, a normal extension is an algebraic field extension L/K for which every irreducible polynomial over K which has a root in L, splits into linear factors in L.[1][2] These are one of the conditions for algebraic extensions to be a Galois extension. Bourbaki calls such an extension a quasi-Galois extension.","image":"d0381945929156997b99bb43e5b7067d18c9a84b.svg","url":"Normal_extension"}
