{"title":"Locally compact space","summary":"In topology and related branches of mathematics, a topological space is called locally compact if, roughly speaking, each small portion of the space looks like a small portion of a compact space. More precisely, it is a topological space in which every point has a compact neighborhood.","image":"fad3e4c8bce043836f9401820b7cbbbacbccaf88.svg","url":"Locally_compact_space"}
