{"title":"Generalized minimal residual method","summary":"In mathematics, the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) is an iterative method for the numerical solution of an indefinite nonsymmetric system of linear equations. The method approximates the solution by the vector in a Krylov subspace with minimal residual. The Arnoldi iteration is used to find this vector.","image":"31b9981ac84e8a1b538a23de2e99a53bc6e4766d.svg","url":"Generalized_minimal_residual_method"}
