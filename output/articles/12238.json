{"title":"Poincaré duality","summary":"In mathematics, the Poincaré duality theorem, named after Henri Poincaré, is a basic result on the structure of the homology and cohomology groups of manifolds.  It states that if M is an n-dimensional oriented closed manifold (compact and without boundary), then the kth cohomology group of M is isomorphic to the ( n − k {\\displaystyle n-k} )th homology group of M, for all integers k","image":"b98e1d6a69bccd09a4b9b69bdf03a08c1706c8c1.svg","url":"Poincaré_duality"}
