{"title":"Wigner's theorem","summary":"Wigner's theorem, proved by Eugene Wigner in 1931,[2]  is a cornerstone of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. The theorem specifies how physical symmetries such as rotations, translations, and CPT are represented on the Hilbert space of states.","image":"Wigner.jpg.webp","url":"Wigner's_theorem"}
