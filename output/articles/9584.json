{"title":"Littlewood–Offord problem","summary":"In mathematical field of combinatorial geometry, the Littlewood–Offord problem is the problem of determining the number of subsums of a set of vectors that fall in a given convex set. More formally, if V is a vector space of dimension d, the problem is to determine, given a finite subset of vectors S and a convex subset A, the number of subsets of S whose summation is in A.","image":"e0e04754665d78a40dac7a2df480bfa1e2c32c60.svg","url":"Littlewood–Offord_problem"}
