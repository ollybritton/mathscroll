{"title":"Kronecker's lemma","summary":"In mathematics, Kronecker's lemma (see, e.g., Shiryaev (1996, Lemma IV.3.2)) is a result about the relationship between convergence of infinite sums and convergence of sequences. The lemma is often used in the proofs of theorems concerning sums of independent random variables such as the strong Law of large numbers. The lemma is named after the German mathematician Leopold Kronecker.","image":"75d11c1ec4156a1985da52f79f49d4623f0aa277.svg","url":"A%2fKronecker's_lemma"}
