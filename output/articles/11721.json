{"title":"Painlevé transcendents","summary":"In mathematics, Painlevé transcendents are solutions to certain nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equations in the complex plane with the Painlevé property (the only movable singularities are poles), but which are not generally solvable in terms of elementary functions. They were discovered by Émile Picard (1889), Paul Painlevé (1900, 1902), Richard Fuchs (1905), and Bertrand Gambier (1910).","image":"ffbbf59083963bd359c062b947940c9189deb215.svg","url":"Painlevé_transcendents"}
