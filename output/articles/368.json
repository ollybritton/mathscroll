{"title":"Additive process","summary":"An additive process, in probability theory, is a cadlag, continuous in probability stochastic process with independent increments. An additive process is the generalization of a Lévy process (a Lévy process is an additive process with identically distributed increments). An example of an additive process is a Brownian motion with a time-dependent drift.[1] The additive process was introduced by Paul Lévy in 1937.[2]","image":"80025e1d695749922e65e153b3f33d0d94a75759.svg","url":"Additive_process"}
