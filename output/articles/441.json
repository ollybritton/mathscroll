{"title":"Affine space","summary":"In mathematics, an affine space is a geometric structure that generalizes some of the properties of Euclidean spaces in such a way that these are independent of the concepts of distance and measure of angles, keeping only the properties related to parallelism and ratio of lengths for parallel line segments.","image":"Affine_space_R3.png.webp","url":"Affine_space"}
