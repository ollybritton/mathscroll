{"title":"Erdős–Rado theorem","summary":"In partition calculus, part of combinatorial set theory, a branch of mathematics, the Erdős–Rado theorem  is a basic result extending Ramsey's theorem to uncountable sets. It is named after Paul Erdős and Richard Rado. It is sometimes also attributed to Đuro Kurepa who proved it under the additional assumption of the generalised continuum hypothesis,[1] and hence the result is sometimes also referred to as the Erdős–Rado–Kurepa theorem.","image":"4aedac712adbb8b87a2d64f72a52ec8a679f019c.svg","url":"Erdős–Rado_theorem"}
