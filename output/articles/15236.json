{"title":"Sum of radicals","summary":"In computational complexity theory, there is an open problem of whether some information about a sum of radicals may be computed in polynomial time depending on the input size, i.e., in the number of bits necessary to represent this sum. It is of importance for many problems in computational geometry, since the computation of the Euclidean distance between two points in the general case involves the computation of a square root, and therefore the perimeter of a polygon or the length of a polygonal chain takes the form of a sum of radicals.[1]","image":"88f8e5154b52c32759c00bcfd8940b97ad925b4f.svg","url":"Sum_of_radicals"}
