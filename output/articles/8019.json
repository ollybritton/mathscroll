{"title":"Involutory matrix","summary":"In mathematics, an involutory matrix is a square matrix that is its own inverse. That is, multiplication by the matrix A is an involution if and only if A2 = I, where I is the n × n identity matrix. Involutory matrices are all square roots of the identity matrix. This is simply a consequence of the fact that any nonsingular matrix multiplied by its inverse is the identity.[1]","image":"70acf66b6e7065b43f304864fe42c501eb8096d5.svg","url":"Involutory_matrix"}
