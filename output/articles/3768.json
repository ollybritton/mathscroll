{"title":"Danzer's configuration","summary":"In mathematics,  Danzer's configuration is a self-dual configuration of 35 lines and 35 points, having 4 points on each line and 4 lines through each point. It is named after the German geometer Ludwig Danzer and was popularised by Branko Gr√ºnbaum.[1] The Levi graph of the configuration is the Kronecker cover of the odd graph O4,[2] and is isomorphic to the middle layer graph of the seven-dimensional hypercube graph Q7. The middle layer graph of an odd-dimensional hypercube graph Q2n+1(n,n+1) is a subgraph whose vertex set consists of all binary strings of length 2n + 1 that have exactly n or n + 1 entries equal to 1, with an edge between any two vertices for which the corresponding binary strings differ in exactly one bit. Every middle layer graph is Hamiltonian.[3]","image":"Danzer_graph.svg.png.webp","url":"Danzer's_configuration"}
