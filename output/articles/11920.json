{"title":"Peakon","summary":"In the theory of integrable systems, a peakon (\"peaked soliton\") is a soliton with discontinuous first derivative; the wave profile is shaped like the graph of the function e − | x | {\\displaystyle e^{-|x|}} . Some examples of non-linear partial differential equations with (multi-)peakon solutions are the Camassa–Holm shallow water wave equation, the Degasperis–Procesi equation and the Fornberg–Whitham equation. Since peakon solutions are only piecewise differentiable, they must be interpreted in a suitable weak sense. The concept was introduced in 1993 by Camassa and Holm in the short but much cited paper where they derived their shallow water equation.[1]","image":"bccca211436b7b431188e0f5051b7d902fcec1e3.svg","url":"Peakon"}
