{"title":"Algebraic extension","summary":"In mathematics, an algebraic extension is a field extension L/K such that every element of the larger field L is algebraic over the smaller field K; that is, if every element of L is a root of a non-zero polynomial with coefficients in K.[1][2] A field extension that is not algebraic, is said to be transcendental, and must contain transcendental elements, that is, elements that are not algebraic.[3][4]","image":"c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a.svg","url":"Algebraic_extension"}
