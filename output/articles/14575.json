{"title":"Smith–Volterra–Cantor set","summary":"In mathematics, the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set (SVC), fat Cantor set, or ε-Cantor set[1] is an example of a set of points on the real line that is nowhere dense (in particular it contains no intervals), yet has positive measure. The Smith–Volterra–Cantor set is named after the mathematicians Henry Smith, Vito Volterra and Georg Cantor.  In an 1875 paper, Smith discussed a nowhere-dense set of positive measure on the real line,[2] and Volterra introduced a similar example in 1881.[3]  The Cantor set as we know it today followed in 1883. The Smith–Volterra–Cantor set is topologically equivalent to the middle-thirds Cantor set.","image":"Smith-Volterra_set.png.webp","url":"Smith–Volterra–Cantor_set"}
