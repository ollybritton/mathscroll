{"title":"List of isotoxal polyhedra and tilings","summary":"In geometry, isotoxal polyhedra and tilings are defined by the property that they have symmetries taking any edge to any other edge.[1] Polyhedra with this property can also be called \"edge-transitive\", but they should be distinguished from edge-transitive graphs, where the symmetries are combinatorial rather than geometric.","image":"Uniform_polyhedron-33-t0.png.webp","url":"List_of_isotoxal_polyhedra_and_tilings"}
