{"title":"Generalizations of Pauli matrices","summary":"In mathematics and physics, in particular quantum information, the term generalized Pauli matrices refers to families of matrices which generalize the (linear algebraic) properties of the Pauli matrices. Here, a few classes of such matrices are summarized.","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Generalizations_of_Pauli_matrices"}
