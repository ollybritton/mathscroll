{"title":"T-norm fuzzy logics","summary":"T-norm fuzzy logics are a family of non-classical logics, informally delimited by having a semantics that takes the real unit interval [0,Â 1] for the system of truth values and functions called t-norms for permissible interpretations of conjunction. They are mainly used in applied fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory as a theoretical basis for approximate reasoning.","image":"b487119b16546cca8396fbeaca49080b7cd7f0e9.svg","url":"T-norm_fuzzy_logics"}
