{"title":"Bella Subbotovskaya","summary":"Bella Abramovna Subbotovskaya (17 December 1937 – 23 September 1982)[1] was a Soviet mathematician who founded the short-lived Jewish People's University (1978–1983) in Moscow.[2][3] The school's purpose was to offer free education to those affected by structured anti-Semitism within the Soviet educational system. Its existence was outside Soviet authority and it was investigated by the KGB. Subbotovskaya herself was interrogated a number of times by the KGB and shortly thereafter was hit by a truck and died, in what has been speculated was an assassination.[4]","image":"Bella_Subbotovskaya_AMS_Photograph.png.webp","url":"Bella_Subbotovskaya"}
