{"title":"Mirror symmetry conjecture","summary":"In mathematics, mirror symmetry is a conjectural relationship between certain Calabi–Yau manifolds and a constructed \"mirror manifold\".  The conjecture allows one to relate the number of rational curves on a Calabi-Yau manifold (encoded as Gromov–Witten invariants) to integrals from a family of varieties (encoded as period integrals on a variation of Hodge structures). In short, this means there is a relation between the number of genus g {\\displaystyle g} algebraic curves of degree d {\\displaystyle d} on a Calabi-Yau variety X {\\displaystyle X} and integrals on a dual variety X ˇ {\\displaystyle {\\check {X}}} . These relations were original discovered by Candelas, de la Ossa, Green, and Parkes[1] in a paper studying a generic quintic threefold in P 4 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} ^{4}} as the variety X {\\displaystyle X} and a construction[2] from the quintic Dwork family X ψ {\\displaystyle X_{\\psi }} giving X ˇ = X ~ ψ {\\displaystyle {\\check {X}}={\\tilde {X}}_{\\psi }} . Shortly after, Sheldon Katz wrote a summary paper[3] outlining part of their construction and conjectures what the rigorous mathematical interpretation could be.","image":"d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77.svg","url":"Mirror_symmetry_conjecture"}
