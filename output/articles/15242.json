{"title":"Sum rule in quantum mechanics","summary":"In quantum mechanics, a sum rule is a formula for transitions between energy levels, in which the sum of the transition strengths is expressed in a simple form. Sum rules are used to describe the properties of many physical systems, including solids, atoms, atomic nuclei, and nuclear constituents such as protons and neutrons.","image":"6bb06de5217295d7fbdbf68fb9c5309a513fc99e.svg","url":"Sum_rule_in_quantum_mechanics"}
