{"title":"Inductive tensor product","summary":"The finest locally convex topological vector space (TVS) topology on X ⊗ Y , {\\displaystyle X\\otimes Y,} the tensor product of two locally convex TVSs, making the canonical map ⋅ ⊗ ⋅ : X × Y → X ⊗ Y {\\displaystyle \\cdot \\otimes \\cdot :X\\times Y\\to X\\otimes Y} (defined by sending ( x , y ) ∈ X × Y {\\displaystyle (x,y)\\in X\\times Y} to x ⊗ y {\\displaystyle x\\otimes y} ) separately continuous is called the inductive topology or the ι {\\displaystyle \\iota } -topology. When X ⊗ Y {\\displaystyle X\\otimes Y} is endowed with this topology then it is denoted by X ⊗ ι Y {\\displaystyle X\\otimes _{\\iota }Y} and called the inductive tensor product of X {\\displaystyle X} and Y . {\\displaystyle Y.} [1]","image":"0725a9acd1b89f205f40114ced6fe8aa0232000b.svg","url":"Inductive_tensor_product"}
