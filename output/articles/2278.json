{"title":"Cartan decomposition","summary":"In mathematics, the Cartan decomposition is a decomposition of a semisimple Lie group or Lie algebra, which plays an important role in their structure theory and representation theory.  It generalizes the polar decomposition or singular value decomposition of matrices.  Its history can be traced to the 1880s work of Ã‰lie Cartan and Wilhelm Killing.[1]","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Cartan_decomposition"}
