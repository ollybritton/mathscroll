{"title":"Earle–Hamilton fixed-point theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Earle–Hamilton fixed point theorem is a result in geometric function theory giving sufficient conditions for a holomorphic mapping of an open domain in a complex Banach space into itself to have a fixed point. The result was proved in 1968 by Clifford Earle and Richard S. Hamilton by showing that, with respect to the Carathéodory metric on the domain, the holomorphic mapping becomes a contraction mapping to which the Banach fixed-point theorem can be applied.","image":"d0c23ef80ae9a53794e5d46fcd0d2e9fcbf874c6.svg","url":"Earle–Hamilton_fixed-point_theorem"}
