{"title":"Gauss–Legendre algorithm","summary":"The Gauss–Legendre algorithm is an algorithm to compute the digits of π. It is notable for being rapidly convergent, with only 25 iterations producing 45 million correct digits of π. However, it has some drawbacks (for example, it is computer memory-intensive) and therefore all record-breaking calculations for many years have used other methods, almost always the Chudnovsky algorithm. For details, see Chronology of computation of π.","image":"85c76d937d3df1859a8d48d32107e4ad6496a465.svg","url":"Gauss–Legendre_algorithm"}
