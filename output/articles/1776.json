{"title":"Blow-up lemma","summary":"The blow-up lemma, proved by János Komlós, Gábor N. Sárközy, and Endre Szemerédi in 1997,[1][2] is an important result in extremal graph theory, particularly within the context of the regularity method. It states that the regular pairs in the statement of Szemerédi's regularity lemma behave like complete bipartite graphs in the context of embedding spanning graphs of bounded degree.","image":"ce67314185650d6f0deba39db7dcec9378f4d4d1.svg","url":"Blow-up_lemma"}
