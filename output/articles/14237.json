{"title":"Severi–Brauer variety","summary":"In mathematics, a Severi–Brauer variety over a field K is an algebraic variety V which becomes isomorphic to a projective space over an algebraic closure of K.  The varieties are associated to central simple algebras in such a way that the algebra splits over K if and only if the variety has a rational point over K.[1]  Francesco Severi (1932) studied these varieties,  and they are also named after Richard Brauer because of their close relation to the Brauer group.","image":"0412b3f8a2807ad31a6f2223b6a3fc16e8baacdd.svg","url":"Severi–Brauer_variety"}
