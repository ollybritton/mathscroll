{"title":"Sauer–Shelah lemma","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics and extremal set theory, the Sauer–Shelah lemma states that every family of sets with small VC dimension consists of a small number of sets. It is named after Norbert Sauer and Saharon Shelah, who published it independently of each other in 1972.[1][2] The same result was also published slightly earlier and again independently, by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis, after whom the VC dimension is named.[3] In his paper containing the lemma, Shelah gives credit also to Micha Perles,[2] and for this reason the lemma has also been called the Perles–Sauer–Shelah lemma.[4]","image":"Sauer–Shelah_lemma.svg.png.webp","url":"Sauer–Shelah_lemma"}
