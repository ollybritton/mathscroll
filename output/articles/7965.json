{"title":"Introduction to systolic geometry","summary":"Systolic geometry is a branch of differential geometry, a field within mathematics, studying problems such as the relationship between the area inside a closed curve C, and the length or perimeter of C. Since the area A may be small while the length l is large, when C looks elongated, the relationship can only take the form of an inequality. What is more, such an inequality would be an upper bound for A: there is no interesting lower bound just in terms of the length.","image":"Building_Interior_Lisbonne_(Unsplash).jpg.webp","url":"Introduction_to_systolic_geometry"}
