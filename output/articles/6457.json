{"title":"Graph bandwidth","summary":"In graph theory, the graph bandwidth problem is to label the n vertices vi of a graph G with distinct integers f ( v i ) {\\displaystyle f(v_{i})} so that the quantity max { | f ( v i ) − f ( v j ) | : v i v j ∈ E } {\\displaystyle \\max\\{\\,|f(v_{i})-f(v_{j})|:v_{i}v_{j}\\in E\\,\\}} is minimized (E is the edge set of G).[1] The problem may be visualized as placing the vertices of a graph at distinct integer points along the x-axis so that the length of the longest edge is minimized. Such placement is called linear graph arrangement, linear graph layout or linear graph placement.[2]","image":"e5cf38504f2236c57a413fa518cf503da8269672.svg","url":"Graph_bandwidth"}
