{"title":"Original proof of Gödel's completeness theorem","summary":"The proof of Gödel's completeness theorem given by Kurt Gödel in his doctoral dissertation of 1929 (and a shorter version of the proof, published as an article in 1930, titled \"The completeness of the axioms of the functional calculus of logic\" (in German)) is not easy to read today; it uses concepts and formalisms that are no longer used and terminology that is often obscure. The version given below attempts to represent all the steps in the proof and all the important ideas faithfully, while restating the proof in the modern language of mathematical logic. This outline should not be considered a rigorous proof of the theorem.","image":"1925_kurt_gödel_(cropped).png.webp","url":"Original_proof_of_Gödel's_completeness_theorem"}
