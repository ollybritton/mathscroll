{"title":"Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector","summary":"In classical mechanics, the Laplace–Runge–Lenz (LRL) vector is a vector used chiefly to describe the shape and orientation of the orbit of one astronomical body around another, such as a binary star or a planet revolving around a star.  For two bodies interacting by Newtonian gravity, the LRL vector is a constant of motion, meaning that it is the same no matter where it is calculated on the orbit;[1][2] equivalently, the LRL vector is said to be conserved.   More generally, the LRL vector is conserved in all problems in which two bodies interact by a central force that varies as the inverse square of the distance between them; such problems are called Kepler problems.[3][4][5][6]","image":"280ae03440942ab348c2ca9b8db6b56ffa9618f8.svg","url":"Laplace–Runge–Lenz_vector"}
