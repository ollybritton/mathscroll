{"title":"Countable set","summary":"In mathematics, a set is countable if either it is finite or it can be made in one to one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.[lower-alpha 1] Equivalently, a set is countable if there exists an injective function from it into the natural numbers; this means that each element in the set may be associated to a unique natural number, or that the elements of the set can be counted one at a time, although the counting may never finish due to an infinite number of elements.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Countable_set"}
