{"title":"Theorem of the three geodesics","summary":"In differential geometry the theorem of the three geodesics, also known as Lyusternikâ€“Schnirelmann theorem,  states that every Riemannian manifold with the topology of a sphere has at least three simple closed geodesics (i.e. three embedded geodesic circles).[1] The result can also be extended to quasigeodesics on a convex polyhedron, and to closed geodesics of reversible Finsler 2-spheres. The theorem is sharp: although every Riemannian 2-sphere contains infinitely many distinct closed geodesics, only three of them are guaranteed to have no self-intersections. For example, by a result of Morse if the lengths of three principal axes of an ellipsoid are distinct, but sufficiently close to each other, then the ellipsoid has only three simple closed geodesics.[2]","image":"Ellipsoid_tri-axial_abc.svg.png.webp","url":"Theorem_of_the_three_geodesics"}
