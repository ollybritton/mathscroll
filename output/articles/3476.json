{"title":"Coulomb wave function","summary":"In mathematics, a Coulomb wave function is a solution of the Coulomb wave equation, named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. They are used to describe the behavior of charged particles in a Coulomb potential and can be written in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions or Whittaker functions of imaginary argument.","image":"Irregular_Coulomb_wave_function_G_plotted_from_0_to_20_with_repulsive_and_attractive_interactions_in_Mathematica.svg.png.webp","url":"Coulomb_wave_function"}
