{"title":"Harshad number","summary":"In mathematics, a harshad number (or Niven number) in a given number base is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written in that base. Harshad numbers in base n are also known as n-harshad (or n-Niven) numbers. Harshad numbers were defined by D. R. Kaprekar, a mathematician from India.[1] The word \"harshad\" comes from the Sanskrit hará¹£a (joy) + da (give), meaning joy-giver. The term \"Niven number\" arose from a paper delivered by Ivan M. Niven at a conference on number theory in 1977.","image":"0bc77764b2e74e64a63341054fa90f3e07db275f.svg","url":"Harshad_number"}
