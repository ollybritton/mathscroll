{"title":"Kähler–Einstein metric","summary":"In differential geometry, a Kähler–Einstein metric on a complex manifold is a Riemannian metric that is both a Kähler metric and an Einstein metric.  A manifold is said to be Kähler–Einstein if it admits a Kähler–Einstein metric.  The most important special case of these are the Calabi–Yau manifolds, which are Kähler and Ricci-flat.","image":"88caf432c0a3d657975de466e743b763a8b2fcf1.svg","url":"Kähler–Einstein_metric"}
