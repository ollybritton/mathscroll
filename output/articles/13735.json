{"title":"Rotor (mathematics)","summary":"A rotor is an object in the geometric algebra (also called Clifford algebra) of a vector space that represents a rotation about the origin.[1] The term originated with William Kingdon Clifford,[2] in showing that the quaternion algebra is just a special case of Hermann Grassmann's \"theory of extension\" (Ausdehnungslehre).[3]  Hestenes[4] defined a rotor to be any element R {\\displaystyle R} of a geometric algebra that can be written as the product of an even number of unit vectors and satisfies R R ~ = 1 {\\displaystyle R{\\tilde {R}}=1} , where R ~ {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {R}}} is the \"reverse\" of R {\\displaystyle R} â€”that is, the product of the same vectors, but in reverse order.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg","url":"Rotor_(mathematics)"}
