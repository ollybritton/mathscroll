{"title":"Joubert's theorem","summary":"In polynomial algebra and field theory, Joubert's theorem states that if K {\\displaystyle K} and L {\\displaystyle L} are fields, L {\\displaystyle L} is a separable field extension of K {\\displaystyle K} of degree 6, and the characteristic of K {\\displaystyle K} is not equal to 2, then L {\\displaystyle L} is generated over K {\\displaystyle K} by some element λ in L {\\displaystyle L} , such that the minimal polynomial p {\\displaystyle p} of λ has the form p ( t ) {\\displaystyle p(t)} = t 6 + c 4 t 4 + c 2 t 2 + c 1 t + c 0 {\\displaystyle t^{6}+c_{4}t^{4}+c_{2}t^{2}+c_{1}t+c_{0}} , for some constants c 4 , c 2 , c 1 , c 0 {\\displaystyle c_{4},c_{2},c_{1},c_{0}} in K {\\displaystyle K} .[1] The theorem is named in honor of Charles Joubert, a French mathematician, lycée professor, and Jesuit priest.[2][3][4][5][6]","image":"2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0.svg","url":"Joubert's_theorem"}
