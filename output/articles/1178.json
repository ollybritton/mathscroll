{"title":"Average crossing number","summary":"In the mathematical subject of knot theory, the average crossing number of a knot is the result of averaging over all directions the number of crossings in a knot diagram of the knot obtained by projection onto the plane orthogonal to the direction.   The average crossing number is often seen in the context of physical knot theory.","image":"b76a5699046c69ac04efe7ee8b31a63792468566.svg","url":"Average_crossing_number"}
