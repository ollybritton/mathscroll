{"title":"Negative pedal curve","summary":"In geometry, a negative pedal curve is a plane curve that can be constructed from another plane curve C and a fixed point P on that curve. For each point X ≠ P on the curve C, the negative pedal curve has a tangent that passes through X and is perpendicular to line XP.  Constructing the negative pedal curve is the inverse operation to constructing a pedal curve.","image":"NegativePedal.gif","url":"Negative_pedal_curve"}
