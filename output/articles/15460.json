{"title":"Table of costs of operations in elliptic curves","summary":"Elliptic curve cryptography is a popular form of public key encryption that is based on the mathematical theory of elliptic curves. Points on an elliptic curve can be added and form a group under this addition operation. This article describes the computational costs for this group addition and certain related operations that are used in elliptic curve cryptography algorithms.","image":"c1df50adf73447a865704be9583c354a5a2cd985.svg","url":"Table_of_costs_of_operations_in_elliptic_curves"}
