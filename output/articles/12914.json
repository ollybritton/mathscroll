{"title":"Quasi-interior point","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, an element x {\\displaystyle x} of an ordered topological vector space X {\\displaystyle X} is called a quasi-interior point of the positive cone C {\\displaystyle C} of X {\\displaystyle X} if x ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle x\\geq 0} and if the order interval [ 0 , x ] := { z ∈ Z : 0 ≤ z and z ≤ x } {\\displaystyle [0,x]:=\\{z\\in Z:0\\leq z{\\text{ and }}z\\leq x\\}} is a total subset of X {\\displaystyle X} ; that is, if the linear span of [ 0 , x ] {\\displaystyle [0,x]} is a dense subset of X . {\\displaystyle X.} [1]","image":"87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4.svg","url":"Quasi-interior_point"}
