{"title":"Normal number","summary":"In mathematics, a real number is said to be simply normal in an integer base b[1] if its infinite sequence of digits is distributed uniformly in the sense that each of the b digit values has the same natural density 1/b. A number is said to be normal in base b if, for every positive integer n, all possible strings n digits long have density b−n.","image":"007bfcbc76f95cc48b0cd21482ff43780feac2f9.svg","url":"Normal_number"}
