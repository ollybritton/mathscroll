{"title":"Genus of a multiplicative sequence","summary":"In mathematics, a genus of a multiplicative sequence is a ring homomorphism from the ring of smooth compact manifolds up to the equivalence of bounding a smooth manifold with boundary (i.e., up to suitable cobordism) to another ring, usually the rational numbers, having the property that they are constructed from a sequence of polynomials in characteristic classes that arise as coefficients in formal power series with good multiplicative properties.","image":"Cobordism.svg.png.webp","url":"Genus_of_a_multiplicative_sequence"}
