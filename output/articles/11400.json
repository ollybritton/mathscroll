{"title":"On Numbers and Games","summary":"On Numbers and Games is a mathematics book by John Horton Conway first published in 1976.[1] The book is  written by a pre-eminent mathematician, and is directed at other mathematicians. The material is, however, developed in a playful and unpretentious manner and many chapters are accessible to non-mathematicians.  Martin Gardner discussed the book at length, particularly Conway's construction of surreal numbers, in his Mathematical Games column in Scientific American in September 1976.[2]","image":"On_Numbers_and_Games.jpg.webp","url":"On_Numbers_and_Games"}
