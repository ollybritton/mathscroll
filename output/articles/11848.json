{"title":"Partially ordered space","summary":"In mathematics, a partially ordered space[1] (or pospace) is a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} equipped with a closed partial order ≤ {\\displaystyle \\leq } , i.e. a partial order whose graph { ( x , y ) ∈ X 2 ∣ x ≤ y } {\\displaystyle \\{(x,y)\\in X^{2}\\mid x\\leq y\\}} is a closed subset of X 2 {\\displaystyle X^{2}} .","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Partially_ordered_space"}
