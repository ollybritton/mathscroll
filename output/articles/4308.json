{"title":"Distortion function","summary":"A distortion function in mathematics and statistics, for example, g : [ 0 , 1 ] → [ 0 , 1 ] {\\displaystyle g:[0,1]\\to [0,1]} , is a non-decreasing function such that g ( 0 ) = 0 {\\displaystyle g(0)=0} and g ( 1 ) = 1 {\\displaystyle g(1)=1} .  The dual distortion function is g ~ ( x ) = 1 − g ( 1 − x ) {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {g}}(x)=1-g(1-x)} .[1][2]  Distortion functions are used to define distortion risk measures.[2]","image":"0329691aecddec5158ad537f5df2e83578a302e2.svg","url":"Distortion_function"}
