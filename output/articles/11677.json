{"title":"p-adic exponential function","summary":"In mathematics, particularly p-adic analysis, the p-adic exponential function is a p-adic analogue of the usual exponential function on the complex numbers. As in the complex case, it has an inverse function, named the p-adic logarithm.","image":"cdf70a282ef5a8ac58571961993736e837ce0ebe.svg","url":"P-adic_exponential_function"}
