{"title":"Edge (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, an edge is a particular type of line segment joining two vertices in a polygon, polyhedron, or higher-dimensional polytope.[1] In a polygon, an edge is a line segment on the boundary,[2] and is often called a polygon side. In a polyhedron or more generally a polytope, an edge is a line segment where two faces (or polyhedron sides) meet.[3] A segment joining two vertices while passing through the interior or exterior is not an edge but instead is called a diagonal.","image":"Triangle.TrigArea.svg.png.webp","url":"Edge_(geometry)"}
