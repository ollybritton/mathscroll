{"title":"Isomorphism of categories","summary":"In category theory, two categories C and D are isomorphic if there exist functors F : C → D and G : D → C which are mutually inverse to each other, i.e. FG = 1D (the identity functor on D) and GF = 1C.[1] This means that both the objects and the morphisms of C and D stand in a one-to-one correspondence to each other. Two isomorphic categories share all properties that are defined solely in terms of category theory; for all practical purposes, they are identical and differ only in the notation of their objects and morphisms.","image":"bb9c340178024233cf89c7cc5d4fc3454254b91e.svg","url":"Isomorphism_of_categories"}
