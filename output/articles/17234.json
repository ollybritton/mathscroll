{"title":"Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra","summary":"Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebras (LMn algebras) were introduced in the 1940s by Grigore Moisil (initially under the name of Łukasiewicz algebras[1]) in the hope of giving algebraic semantics for the n-valued Łukasiewicz logic. However, in 1956 Alan Rose discovered that for n ≥ 5, the Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra does not model the Łukasiewicz logic. A faithful model for the ℵ0-valued (infinitely-many-valued) Łukasiewicz–Tarski logic was provided by C. C. Chang's MV-algebra, introduced in 1958. For the axiomatically more complicated (finite) n-valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by Revaz Grigolia and called MVn-algebras.[2] MVn-algebras are a subclass of LMn-algebras, and the inclusion is strict for n ≥ 5.[3] In 1982 Roberto Cignoli published some additional constraints that added to LMn-algebras produce proper models for n-valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery proper Łukasiewicz algebras.[4]","image":"62e1614ceeb3af235e0c267f278189c438cbeb09.svg","url":"Łukasiewicz–Moisil_algebra"}
