{"title":"Open mapping theorem (functional analysis)","summary":"In functional analysis, the open mapping theorem, also known as the Banachâ€“Schauder theorem or the Banach theorem[1] (named after Stefan Banach and Juliusz Schauder), is a fundamental result which states that if a bounded or continuous linear operator between Banach spaces is surjective then it is an open map.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Open_mapping_theorem_(functional_analysis)"}
