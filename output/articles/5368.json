{"title":"Fermi coordinates","summary":"In the mathematical theory of Riemannian geometry, there are two uses of the term Fermi coordinates. In one use they are local coordinates that are adapted to a geodesic.[1] In a second, more general one, they are local coordinates that are adapted to any world line, even not geodesical.[2]","image":"c6c1fe5162c791d313070bcc45e5b7d92b2b65c7.svg","url":"Fermi_coordinates"}
