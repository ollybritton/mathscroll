{"title":"Generalized normal distribution","summary":"The generalized normal distribution or generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) is either of two families of parametric continuous probability distributions on the real line.  Both families add a shape parameter to the normal distribution.  To distinguish the two families, they are referred to below as \"symmetric\" and \"asymmetric\"; however, this is not a standard nomenclature.","image":"Generalized_normal_densities.svg.png.webp","url":"Generalized_normal_distribution"}
