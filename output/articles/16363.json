{"title":"Uniform module","summary":"In abstract algebra, a module is called a uniform module if the intersection of any two nonzero submodules is nonzero.  This is equivalent to saying that every nonzero submodule of M is an essential submodule.  A ring may be called a right (left) uniform ring if it is uniform as a right (left) module over itself.","image":"e5fe04b1b525c9f9b8be405a5b579278e45d6ac6.svg","url":"Uniform_module"}
