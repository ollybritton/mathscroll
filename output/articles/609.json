{"title":"Algebraic representation","summary":"In mathematics, an algebraic representation of a group G on a k-algebra A is a linear representation π : G → G L ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\pi :G\\to GL(A)} such that, for each g in G, π ( g ) {\\displaystyle \\pi (g)} is an algebra automorphism. Equipped with such a representation, the algebra A is then called a G-algebra.","image":"06a861888f803e5a646a115438d5474ca16d47d0.svg","url":"Algebraic_representation"}
