{"title":"Algebraic character","summary":"An algebraic character is a formal expression attached to a module in representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras that generalizes the character of a finite-dimensional representation and is analogous to the Harish-Chandra character of the representations of semisimple Lie groups.","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Algebraic_character"}
