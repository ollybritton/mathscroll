{"title":"Victor Puiseux","summary":"Victor Alexandre Puiseux (French: [pɥizø]; 16 April 1820 – 9 September 1883) was a French mathematician and astronomer.  Puiseux series are named after him, as is in part the Bertrand–Diquet–Puiseux theorem. His work on algebraic functions and uniformization makes him a direct precursor of Bernhard Riemann, for what concerns the latter's work on this subject and his introduction of Riemann surfaces.[1] He was also an accomplished amateur mountaineer. A peak in the French alps, which he climbed in 1848, is named after him.","image":"Victor_Puiseux.jpeg.webp","url":"Victor_Puiseux"}
