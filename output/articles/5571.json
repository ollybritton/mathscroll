{"title":"Forcing (mathematics)","summary":"In the mathematical discipline of set theory, forcing is a technique for proving consistency and independence results. Intuitively, forcing can be thought of as a technique to expand the set theoretical universe V {\\displaystyle V} to a larger universe V [ G ] {\\displaystyle V[G]} by introducing a new \"generic\" object G {\\displaystyle G} .","image":"af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845.svg","url":"Forcing_(mathematics)"}
