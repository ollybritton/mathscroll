{"title":"Hemicontinuity","summary":"In mathematics, the notion of the continuity of functions is not immediately extensible to set-valued functions between two sets A and B. The dual concepts of upper hemicontinuity and lower hemicontinuity facilitate such an extension. A set-valued function that has both properties is said to be continuous in an analogy to the property of the same name for functions.","image":"Upper_hemicontinuous.svg.png.webp","url":"Hemicontinuity"}
