{"title":"List of textbooks in electromagnetism","summary":"The study of electromagnetism in higher education, as a fundamental part of both physics and engineering, is typically accompanied by textbooks devoted to the subject. The American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers recommend a full year of graduate study in electromagnetism for all physics graduate students.[1] A joint task force by those organizations in 2006 found that in 76 of the 80 US physics departments surveyed, a course using John David Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics was required for all first year graduate students.[1] For undergraduates, there are several widely used textbooks, including David Griffiths' Introduction to Electrodynamics and Electricity and Magnetism by Edward Mills Purcell and D. J. Morin.[2] Also at an undergraduate level, Richard Feynman's classic The Feynman Lectures on Physics is available online to read for free.","image":"VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_textbooks_in_electromagnetism"}
