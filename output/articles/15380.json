{"title":"Symmetric rank-one","summary":"The Symmetric Rank 1 (SR1) method is a quasi-Newton method to update the second derivative (Hessian) based on the derivatives (gradients) calculated at two points. It is a generalization to the secant method for a multidimensional problem. This update maintains the symmetry of the matrix but does not guarantee that the update be positive definite.","image":"56846d99e780ebee609728e76389fa84f6cbac81.svg","url":"Symmetric_rank-one"}
