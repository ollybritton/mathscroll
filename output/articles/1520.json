{"title":"Bessel's correction","summary":"In statistics, Bessel's correction is the use of n − 1 instead of n in the formula for the sample variance and sample standard deviation,[1] where n is the number of observations in a sample. This method corrects the bias in the estimation of the population variance. It also partially corrects the bias in the estimation of the population standard deviation. However, the correction often increases the mean squared error in these estimations. This technique is named after Friedrich Bessel.","image":"6974ee193d65563f60fc27fc4abe9bfa5863d59f.svg","url":"Bessel's_correction"}
