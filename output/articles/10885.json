{"title":"n-group (category theory)","summary":"In mathematics, an n-group, or n-dimensional higher group, is a special kind of n-category that generalises the concept of group to higher-dimensional algebra.  Here, n {\\displaystyle n} may be any natural number or infinity. The thesis of Alexander Grothendieck's student Hoàng Xuân Sính was an in-depth study of 2-groups under the moniker 'gr-category'.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg","url":"N-group_(category_theory)"}
