{"title":"Cuboid","summary":"In geometry, a cuboid is a hexahedron, a six-faced solid. Its faces are quadrilaterals. Cuboid means \"like a cube\". A cuboid is like a cube in the sense that by adjusting the lengths of the edges or the angles between faces a cuboid can be transformed into a cube. In mathematical language a cuboid is a convex polyhedron whose polyhedral graph is the same as that of a cube.","image":"Hexahedron.png.webp","url":"Cuboid"}
