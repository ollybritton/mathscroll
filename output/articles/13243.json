{"title":"Recursive tree","summary":"In graph theory, a recursive tree (i.e., unordered tree) is a labeled, rooted tree. A size-n recursive tree's vertices are labeled by distinct positive integers 1, 2, â€¦, n, where the labels are strictly increasing starting at the root labeled 1. Recursive trees are non-planar, which means that the children of a particular vertex are not ordered; for example, the following two size-3 recursive trees are equivalent: 3/1\\2 = 2/1\\3.","image":"13c5b835b138d4aa7182ec5ef24713581096d464.svg","url":"Recursive_tree"}
