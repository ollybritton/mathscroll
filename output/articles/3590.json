{"title":"Crystal base","summary":"A crystal base for a representation of a quantum group on a Q ( v ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} (v)} -vector space is not a base of that vector space but rather a Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } -base of L / v L {\\displaystyle L/vL} where L {\\displaystyle L} is a Q ( v ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} (v)} -lattice in that vector spaces. Crystal bases appeared in the work of Kashiwara (1990) and also in the work of Lusztig (1990). They can be viewed as specializations as v → 0 {\\displaystyle v\\to 0} of the canonical basis defined by Lusztig (1990).","image":"3d71c1463101ea935165f32e3aef596d3a4f3968.svg","url":"Crystal_base"}
