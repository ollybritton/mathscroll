{"title":"Napkin ring problem","summary":"In geometry, the napkin-ring problem involves finding the volume of a \"band\" of specified height around a sphere, i.e. the part that remains after a hole in the shape of a circular cylinder is drilled through the center of the sphere. It is a counterintuitive fact that this volume does not depend on the original sphere's radius but only on the resulting band's height.","image":"Sphere_bands.svg.png.webp","url":"Napkin_ring_problem"}
