{"title":"Space complexity","summary":"The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.[1]","image":"328a10f1262414118d5f14b437b7b4ae4c2ac1a0.svg","url":"Space_complexity"}
