{"title":"Kodaira embedding theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Kodaira embedding theorem characterises non-singular projective varieties, over the complex numbers, amongst compact KÃ¤hler manifolds. In effect it says precisely which complex manifolds are defined by homogeneous polynomials.","image":"90678eb63c250b5c89bf3649fd098580586d3515.svg","url":"Kodaira_embedding_theorem"}
