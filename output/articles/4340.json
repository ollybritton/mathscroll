{"title":"Division by infinity","summary":"In mathematics, division by infinity is division where the divisor (denominator) is infinity. In ordinary arithmetic, this does not have a well-defined meaning, since infinity is a mathematical concept that does not correspond to a specific number, and moreover, there is no nonzero real number that, when added to itself an infinite number of times, gives a finite number. However, \"dividing by infinity\" can be given meaning as an informal way of expressing the limit of dividing a number by larger and larger divisors.[1]: 201–204","image":"Hyperbola_one_over_x.svg.png.webp","url":"Division_by_infinity"}
