{"title":"Positive operator (Hilbert space)","summary":"In mathematics (specifically linear algebra, operator theory, and functional analysis) as well as physics, a linear operator A {\\displaystyle A} acting on an inner product space is called positive-semidefinite (or non-negative) if, for every x ∈ Dom ⁡ ( A ) {\\displaystyle x\\in \\mathop {\\text{Dom}} (A)} , ⟨ A x , x ⟩ ∈ R {\\displaystyle \\langle Ax,x\\rangle \\in \\mathbb {R} } and ⟨ A x , x ⟩ ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle \\langle Ax,x\\rangle \\geq 0} , where Dom ⁡ ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\mathop {\\text{Dom}} (A)} is the domain of A {\\displaystyle A} . Positive-semidefinite operators are denoted as A ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle A\\geq 0} .  The operator is said to be positive-definite, and written A > 0 {\\displaystyle A>0} , if ⟨ A x , x ⟩ > 0 , {\\displaystyle \\langle Ax,x\\rangle >0,} for all x ∈ D o m ⁡ ( A ) ∖ { 0 } {\\displaystyle x\\in \\mathop {\\mathrm {Dom} } (A)\\setminus \\{0\\}} .","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Positive_operator_(Hilbert_space)"}
