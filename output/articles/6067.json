{"title":"Generalized complex structure","summary":"In the field of mathematics known as differential geometry, a generalized complex structure is a property of a differential manifold that includes as special cases a complex structure and a symplectic structure. Generalized complex structures were introduced by Nigel Hitchin in 2002 and further developed by his students Marco Gualtieri and Gil Cavalcanti.","image":"708862574aa8cca21669fb8470938d29397ade31.svg","url":"Generalized_complex_structure"}
