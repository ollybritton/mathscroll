{"title":"Trigonal trapezohedral honeycomb","summary":"In geometry, the trigonal trapezohedral honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 3-space. Cells are identical trigonal trapezohedra or rhombohedra. Conway, Burgiel, and Goodman-Strauss call it an oblate cubille.[1]","image":"CDel_labelh.png.webp","url":"Trigonal_trapezohedral_honeycomb"}
