{"title":"Double complex","summary":"In mathematics, specifically Homological algebra, a double complex is a generalization of a chain complex where instead of having a Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} } -grading, the objects in the bicomplex have a Z × Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} \\times \\mathbb {Z} } -grading. The most general definition of a double complex, or a bicomplex, is given with objects in an additive category A {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}} . A bicomplex[1] is a sequence of objects C p , q ∈ Ob ( A ) {\\displaystyle C_{p,q}\\in {\\text{Ob}}({\\mathcal {A}})} with two differentials, the horizontal differential","image":"449494a083e0a1fda2b61c62b2f09b6bee4633dc.svg","url":"Double_complex"}
