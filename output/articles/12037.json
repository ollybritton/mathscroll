{"title":"Permutation pattern","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics and theoretical computer science, a permutation pattern is a sub-permutation of a longer permutation. Any permutation may be written in one-line notation as a sequence of digits representing the result of applying the permutation to the digit sequence 123...; for instance the digit sequence 213 represents the permutation on three elements that swaps elements 1 and 2. If  π and σ are two permutations represented in this way (these variable names are standard for permutations and are unrelated to the number pi), then π is said to contain σ as a pattern if some subsequence of the digits of π has the same relative order as all of the digits of σ.","image":"ff84ee2bc577e5f93cf19917444c93981998db24.svg","url":"Permutation_pattern"}
