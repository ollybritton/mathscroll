{"title":"Residue number system","summary":"A residue numeral system (RNS) is a numeral system representing integers by their values modulo several pairwise coprime integers called the moduli. This representation is allowed by the Chinese remainder theorem, which asserts that, if M is the product of the moduli, there is, in an interval of length M, exactly one integer having any given set of modular values. The arithmetic of a residue numeral system is also called multi-modular arithmetic.","image":"e94a1c91761f12da9a2a9c01f9d28db77ea35c9a.svg","url":"Residue_number_system"}
