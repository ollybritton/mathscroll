{"title":"Cut locus (Riemannian manifold)","summary":"In Riemannian geometry, the cut locus of a point p {\\displaystyle p} in a manifold is roughly the set of all other points for which there are multiple minimizing geodesics connecting them from p {\\displaystyle p} , but it may contain additional points where the minimizing geodesic is unique, under certain circumstances.  The distance function from p is a smooth function except at the point p itself and the cut locus.","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Cut_locus_(Riemannian_manifold)"}
