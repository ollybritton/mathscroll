{"title":"Quantized state systems method","summary":"The quantized state systems (QSS) methods are a family of numerical integration solvers based on the idea of state quantization, dual to the traditional idea of time discretization. Unlike traditional numerical solution methods, which approach the problem by discretizing time and solving for the next (real-valued) state at each successive time step, QSS methods keep time as a continuous entity and instead quantize the system's state, instead solving for the time at which the state deviates from its quantized value by a quantum.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Quantized_state_systems_method"}
