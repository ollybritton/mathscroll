{"title":"Efficiency (statistics)","summary":"In statistics, efficiency is a measure of quality of an estimator, of an experimental design,[1] or of a hypothesis testing procedure.[2]  Essentially, a more efficient estimator needs fewer input data or observations than a less efficient one to achieve the Cramér–Rao bound. An efficient estimator is characterized by having the smallest possible variance, indicating that there is a small deviance between the estimated value and the \"true\" value in the L2 norm sense.
