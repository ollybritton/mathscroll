{"title":"Cubic reciprocity","summary":"Cubic reciprocity is a collection of theorems in elementary and algebraic  number theory that state conditions under which the congruence x3 ≡ p (mod q) is solvable; the word \"reciprocity\" comes from the form of the main theorem, which states that if p and q are primary numbers in the ring of Eisenstein integers, both coprime to 3, the congruence x3 ≡ p (mod q) is solvable if and only if  x3 ≡ q (mod p) is solvable.","image":"254dbb1932fcf5ce22d635533cde267f75ee06d0.svg","url":"Cubic_reciprocity"}
