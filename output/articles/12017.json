{"title":"Perfect set","summary":"In general topology, a subset of a topological space is perfect if it is closed and has no isolated points. Equivalently: the set S {\\displaystyle S} is perfect if S = S ′ {\\displaystyle S=S'} , where S ′ {\\displaystyle S'} denotes the set of all limit points of S {\\displaystyle S} , also known as the derived set of S {\\displaystyle S} .","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Perfect_set"}
