{"title":"Hilbert's second problem","summary":"In mathematics, Hilbert's second problem was posed by David Hilbert in 1900 as one of his 23 problems.  It asks for a proof that the arithmetic is consistent â€“ free of any internal contradictions. Hilbert  stated that the axioms he considered for arithmetic were the ones given in Hilbert (1900), which include a second order completeness axiom.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Hilbert's_second_problem"}
