{"title":"Hypersimplex","summary":"In polyhedral combinatorics, the hypersimplex Δ d , k {\\displaystyle \\Delta _{d,k}} is a convex polytope that generalizes the simplex. It is determined by two integers d {\\displaystyle d} and k {\\displaystyle k} , and is defined as the convex hull of the d {\\displaystyle d} -dimensional vectors whose coefficients consist of k {\\displaystyle k} ones and d − k {\\displaystyle d-k} zeros. Equivalently, Δ d , k {\\displaystyle \\Delta _{d,k}} can be obtained by slicing the d {\\displaystyle d} -dimensional unit hypercube [ 0 , 1 ] d {\\displaystyle [0,1]^{d}} with the hyperplane of equation x 1 + ⋯ + x d = k {\\displaystyle x_{1}+\\cdots +x_{d}=k} and, for this reason, it is a ( d − 1 ) {\\displaystyle (d-1)} -dimensional polytope when 0 < k < d {\\displaystyle 0<k<d} .[1]","image":"ec489e3c6fa65ee41116d64b61ea6981949ed764.svg","url":"Hypersimplex"}
