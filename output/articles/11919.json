{"title":"Paving matroid","summary":"In the mathematical theory of matroids, a paving matroid is a matroid in which every circuit has size at least as large as the matroid's rank. In a matroid of rank r {\\displaystyle r} every circuit has size at most r + 1 {\\displaystyle r+1} , so it is equivalent to define paving matroids as the matroids in which the size of every circuit belongs to the set { r , r + 1 } {\\displaystyle \\{r,r+1\\}} .[1] It has been conjectured that almost all matroids are paving matroids.","image":"0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538.svg","url":"Paving_matroid"}
