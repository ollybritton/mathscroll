{"title":"Triclinic crystal system","summary":"In crystallography, the triclinic (or anorthic) crystal system is one of the 7 crystal systems. A crystal system is described by three basis vectors. In the triclinic system, the crystal is described by vectors of unequal length, as in the orthorhombic system. In addition, the angles between these vectors must all be different and may not include 90Â°.","image":"Microcline.jpeg.webp","url":"Triclinic_crystal_system"}
