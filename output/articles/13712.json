{"title":"Rose–Vinet equation of state","summary":"The Rose–Vinet equation of state is a set of equations used to describe the equation of state of solid objects. It is a modification of the Birch–Murnaghan equation of state.[1][2] The initial paper discusses how the equation only depends on four inputs: the isothermal bulk modulus B 0 {\\displaystyle B_{0}} , the derivative of bulk modulus with respect to pressure B 0 ′ {\\displaystyle B_{0}'} , the volume V 0 {\\displaystyle V_{0}} , and the thermal expansion; all evaluated at zero pressure ( P = 0 {\\displaystyle P=0} ) and at a single (reference) temperature. The same equation holds for all classes of solids and a wide range of temperatures.","image":"03a3f39a56ba486e7c6ec89b99f5ae2a21fa75b6.svg","url":"Rose–Vinet_equation_of_state"}
