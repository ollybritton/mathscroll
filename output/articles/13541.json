{"title":"Riemann invariant","summary":"Riemann invariants are mathematical transformations made on a system of conservation equations to make them more easily solvable. Riemann invariants are constant along the characteristic curves of the partial differential equations where they obtain the name invariant. They were first obtained by Bernhard Riemann in his work on plane waves in gas dynamics.[1]","image":"7e6fe8363947e2a0183e266525d5b232c4b1c121.svg","url":"Riemann_invariant"}
