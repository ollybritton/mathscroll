{"title":"Two-graph","summary":"In mathematics, a two-graph is a set of (unordered) triples chosen from a finite vertex set X, such that every (unordered) quadruple from X contains an even number of triples of the two-graph.  A regular two-graph has the property that every pair of vertices lies in the same number of triples of the two-graph.  Two-graphs have been studied because of their connection with equiangular lines and, for regular two-graphs, strongly regular graphs, and also finite groups because many regular two-graphs have interesting automorphism groups.","image":"Xyswitch.svg.png.webp","url":"Two-graph"}
