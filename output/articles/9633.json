{"title":"Locally convex vector lattice","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in order theory and functional analysis, a locally convex vector lattice (LCVL) is a topological vector lattice that is also a locally convex space.[1] LCVLs are important in the theory of topological vector lattices.","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Locally_convex_vector_lattice"}
