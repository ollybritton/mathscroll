{"title":"Angular velocity","summary":"In physics, angular velocity or rotational velocity (ω or Ω), also known as angular frequency vector,[1] is a pseudovector representation of how fast the angular position or orientation of an object changes with time (i.e. how quickly an object rotates or revolves relative to a point or axis). The magnitude of the pseudovector represents the angular speed, the rate at which the object rotates or revolves, and its direction is normal to the instantaneous plane of rotation or angular displacement. The orientation of angular velocity is conventionally specified by the right-hand rule.[2]","image":"93052dac36659d4d2f66e3622a224cf070e83d6f.svg","url":"Angular_velocity"}
