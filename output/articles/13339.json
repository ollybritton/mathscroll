{"title":"Regularization by spectral filtering","summary":"Spectral regularization is any of a class of regularization techniques used in machine learning to control the impact of noise and prevent overfitting. Spectral regularization can be used in a broad range of applications, from deblurring images to classifying emails into a spam folder and a non-spam folder. For instance, in the email classification example, spectral regularization can be used to reduce the impact of noise and prevent overfitting when a machine learning system is being trained on a labeled set of emails to learn how to tell a spam and a non-spam email apart.","image":"432948f704d56b4d3c7aec5a494f63b5a59347dd.svg","url":"Regularization_by_spectral_filtering"}
