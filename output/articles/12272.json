{"title":"Poisson kernel","summary":"In mathematics, and specifically in potential theory, the Poisson kernel is an integral kernel, used for solving the two-dimensional Laplace equation, given Dirichlet boundary conditions on the unit disk. The kernel can be understood as the derivative of the Green's function for the Laplace equation. It is named for Sim√©on Poisson.","image":"84519ed01836920b558797bdbe20da4a1aa5efd0.svg","url":"Poisson_kernel"}
