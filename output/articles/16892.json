{"title":"Whitney immersion theorem","summary":"In differential topology, the Whitney immersion theorem (named after Hassler Whitney) states that for m > 1 {\\displaystyle m>1} , any smooth m {\\displaystyle m} -dimensional manifold (required also to be Hausdorff and second-countable) has a one-to-one immersion in Euclidean 2 m {\\displaystyle 2m} -space, and a (not necessarily one-to-one) immersion in ( 2 m − 1 ) {\\displaystyle (2m-1)} -space. Similarly, every smooth m {\\displaystyle m} -dimensional manifold can be immersed in the 2 m − 1 {\\displaystyle 2m-1} -dimensional sphere (this removes the m > 1 {\\displaystyle m>1} constraint).","image":"7f27527902d05e4c32bcbe28d425d7790f8ae191.svg","url":"Whitney_immersion_theorem"}
