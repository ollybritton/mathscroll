{"title":"Seifert fiber space","summary":"A Seifert fiber space is a 3-manifold together with a decomposition as a disjoint union of circles. In other words, it is a S 1 {\\displaystyle S^{1}} -bundle (circle bundle) over a 2-dimensional orbifold. Many 3-manifolds are Seifert fiber spaces, and they account for all compact oriented manifolds in 6 of the 8 Thurston geometries of the geometrization conjecture.","image":"60796c8d0c03cf575637d3202463b214d9635880.svg","url":"Seifert_fiber_space"}
