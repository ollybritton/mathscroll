{"title":"Lambda-mu calculus","summary":"In mathematical logic and computer science, the lambda-mu calculus is an extension of the lambda calculus introduced by M. Parigot.[1] It introduces two new operators: the μ operator (which is completely different both from the μ operator found in computability theory and from the μ operator of modal μ-calculus) and the bracket operator. Proof-theoretically, it provides a well-behaved formulation of classical natural deduction.","image":"c49541d37c62956ea6d5618d8c3d017d09002da6.svg","url":"Lambda-mu_calculus"}
