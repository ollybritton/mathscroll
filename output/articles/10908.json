{"title":"Nagata's compactification theorem","summary":"In algebraic geometry, Nagata's compactification theorem, introduced by NagataÂ (1962, 1963), implies that every abstract variety can be embedded in a complete variety, and more generally shows that a separated and finite type morphism to a Noetherian scheme S can be factored into an open immersion followed by a proper morphism.","image":"a5f8807809ba33894a39edf0a1dd14d796e74701.svg","url":"Nagata's_compactification_theorem"}
