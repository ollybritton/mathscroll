{"title":"Repeated game","summary":"In game theory, a repeated game is an extensive form game that consists of a number of repetitions of some base game (called a stage game).  The stage game is usually one of the well-studied 2-person games. Repeated games capture the idea that a player will have to take into account the impact of his or her current action on the future actions of other players; this impact is sometimes called his or her reputation.  Single stage game or single shot game are names for non-repeated games.","image":"f279a30bc8eabc788f3fe81c9cfb674e72e858db.svg","url":"Repeated_game"}
