{"title":"Bicoherence","summary":"In mathematics and statistical analysis, bicoherence (also known as bispectral coherency) is a squared normalised version of the bispectrum. The bicoherence takes values bounded between 0 and 1, which make it a convenient measure for quantifying the extent of phase coupling in a signal. The prefix bi- in bispectrum and bicoherence refers not to two time series  xt, yt but rather to two frequencies of a single signal.","image":"00693682039abbb94670934731405db75ae95dd1.svg","url":"Bicoherence"}
