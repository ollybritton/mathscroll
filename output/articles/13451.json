{"title":"Reverse perspective","summary":"Reverse perspective, also called inverse perspective,[1] inverted perspective,[2] divergent perspective,[3][4] or Byzantine perspective,[5] is a form of perspective drawing in which the objects depicted in a scene are placed between the projective point and the viewing plane. Objects farther away from the viewing plane are drawn as larger, and closer objects are drawn as smaller, in contrast to the more conventional linear perspective for which closer objects appear larger.[3] Lines that are parallel in three-dimensional space are drawn as diverging against the horizon, rather than converging as they do in linear perspective.[1] Technically, the vanishing points are placed outside the painting with the illusion that they are \"in front of\" the painting.","image":"Reverse_perspective.svg.png.webp","url":"Reverse_perspective"}
