{"title":"Infinite-order triangular tiling","summary":"In geometry, the infinite-order triangular tiling is a regular tiling of the hyperbolic plane with a Schläfli symbol of {3,∞}. All vertices are ideal, located at \"infinity\" and seen on the boundary of the Poincaré hyperbolic disk projection.","image":"H2_tiling_23i-4.png.webp","url":"Infinite-order_triangular_tiling"}
