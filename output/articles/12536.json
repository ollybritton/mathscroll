{"title":"Prismatic uniform polyhedron","summary":"In geometry, a prismatic uniform polyhedron is a uniform polyhedron with dihedral symmetry. They exist in two infinite families, the uniform prisms and the uniform antiprisms. All have their vertices in parallel planes and are therefore prismatoids.","image":"Pentagrammic_antiprism.png.webp","url":"Prismatic_uniform_polyhedron"}
