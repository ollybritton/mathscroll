{"title":"Momentum map","summary":"In mathematics, specifically in symplectic geometry, the momentum map (or, by false etymology, moment map[1]) is a tool associated with a Hamiltonian action of a Lie group on a symplectic manifold, used to construct conserved quantities for the action. The momentum map generalizes the classical notions of linear and angular momentum. It is an essential ingredient in various constructions of symplectic manifolds, including symplectic (Marsdenâ€“Weinstein) quotients, discussed below, and symplectic cuts and sums.","image":"40a913b1503ed9ec94361b99f7fd59ef60705c28.svg","url":"Momentum_map"}
