{"title":"Dunce hat (topology)","summary":"In topology, the dunce hat is a compact topological space formed by taking a solid triangle and gluing all three sides together, with the orientation of one side reversed. Simply gluing two sides oriented in the opposite direction would yield a cone much like the dunce cap, but the gluing of the third side results in identifying the base of the cap with a line joining the base to the point.","image":"DunceHatSpace.png.webp","url":"Dunce_hat_(topology)"}
