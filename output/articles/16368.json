{"title":"Uniform space","summary":"In the mathematical field of topology, a uniform space is a topological space with additional structure that is used to define uniform properties, such as completeness, uniform continuity and uniform convergence. Uniform spaces generalize metric spaces and topological groups, but the concept is designed to formulate the weakest axioms needed for most proofs in analysis.","image":"aed80a2011a3912b028ba32a52dfa57165455f24.svg","url":"Uniform_space"}
