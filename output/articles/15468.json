{"title":"Tait–Kneser theorem","summary":"In differential geometry, the Tait–Kneser theorem states that, if a smooth plane curve has monotonic curvature, then the osculating circles of the curve are disjoint and nested within each other.[1] The logarithmic spiral or the pictured Archimedean spiral provide examples of curves whose curvature is monotonic for the entire curve. This monotonicity cannot happen for a simple closed curve (by the four-vertex theorem, there are at least four vertices where the curvature reaches an extreme point)[1] but for such curves the theorem can be applied to the arcs of the curves between its vertices.","image":"Log_spiral_with_osculating_circles.jpg.webp","url":"Tait–Kneser_theorem"}
