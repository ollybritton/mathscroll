{"title":"Cohomotopy set","summary":"In mathematics, particularly algebraic topology, cohomotopy sets are particular contravariant functors from the category of pointed topological spaces and basepoint-preserving continuous maps to the category of sets and functions. They are dual to the homotopy groups, but less studied.","image":"4625735b2dd3846da1c72394af0bd21c0f7a8ae0.svg","url":"Cohomotopy_set"}
