{"title":"Hyperbolic space","summary":"In mathematics, hyperbolic space of dimension n is the unique simply connected, n-dimensional Riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature equal to -1. It is homogeneous, and satisfies the stronger property of being a symmetric space. There are many ways to construct it as an open subset of R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} with an explicitly written Riemannian metric; such constructions are referred to as models. Hyperbolic 2-space, H2, which was the first instance studied, is also called the hyperbolic plane.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Hyperbolic_space"}
