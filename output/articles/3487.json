{"title":"Counting board","summary":"The counting board is the precursor of the abacus, and the earliest known form of a counting device (excluding fingers and other very simple methods). Counting boards were made of stone or wood, and the counting was done on the board with beads, or pebbles etc. Not many boards survive because of the perishable materials used in their construction.","image":"Rechentisch.png.webp","url":"Counting_board"}
