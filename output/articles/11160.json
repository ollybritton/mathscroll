{"title":"Noncentral chi-squared distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the noncentral chi-squared distribution (or noncentral chi-square distribution, noncentral Ï‡ 2 {\\displaystyle \\chi ^{2}} distribution) is a noncentral generalization of the chi-squared distribution.  It often arises in the power analysis of statistical tests in which the null distribution is (perhaps asymptotically) a chi-squared distribution; important examples of such tests are the likelihood-ratio tests.[1]","image":"8c0cc9237ec72a1da6d18bc8e7fb24cdda43a49a.svg","url":"Noncentral_chi-squared_distribution"}
