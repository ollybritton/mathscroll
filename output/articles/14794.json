{"title":"Spherical wedge","summary":"In geometry, a spherical wedge or ungula is a portion of a ball  bounded by two plane semidisks and a spherical lune (termed the wedge's base). The angle between the radii lying within the bounding semidisks is the dihedral α. If AB is a semidisk that forms a ball when completely revolved about the z-axis, revolving AB only through a given α produces a spherical wedge of the same angle α.[1] Beman (2008)[2] remarks that \"a spherical wedge is to the sphere of which it is a part as the angle of the wedge is to a perigon.\" [A]  A spherical wedge of α = π radians (180°) is called a hemisphere, while a spherical wedge of α = 2π radians (360°) constitutes a complete ball.","image":"Spherical_Wedge.svg.png.webp","url":"Spherical_wedge"}
