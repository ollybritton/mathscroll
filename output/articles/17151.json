{"title":"Zero dagger","summary":"In set theory, 0† (zero dagger) is a particular subset of the natural numbers,  first defined by Robert M. Solovay in unpublished work in the 1960s. (The superscript † should be a dagger, but it appears as a plus sign on some browsers.) The definition is a bit awkward, because there might be no set of natural numbers satisfying the conditions. Specifically, if ZFC is consistent, then ZFC + \"0† does not exist\" is consistent. ZFC + \"0† exists\" is not known to be inconsistent (and most set theorists believe that it is consistent). In other words, it is believed to be independent (see large cardinal for a discussion). It is usually formulated as follows:","image":"ae18901d45455dd6b9e1efbd76252e628684557d.svg","url":"Zero_dagger"}
