{"title":"Fuzzy relation","summary":"A fuzzy relation is the cartesian product of mathematical fuzzy sets.[1] Two fuzzy sets are taken as input, the fuzzy relation is then equal to the cross product of the sets which is created by vector multiplication. Usually, a rule base is stored in a matrix notation which allows the fuzzy controller to update its internal values.[2][3]","image":"Cartesian_Product_qtl1.svg.png.webp","url":"Fuzzy_relation"}
