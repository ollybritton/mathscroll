{"title":"Raviart–Thomas basis functions","summary":"In applied mathematics, Raviart–Thomas basis functions are vector basis functions used in finite element and boundary element methods. They are regularly used as basis functions when working in electromagnetics. They are sometimes called Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions.[1]","image":"5a6cd646126efc7e813f3fde037719e214485f9f.svg","url":"Raviart–Thomas_basis_functions"}
