{"title":"Trace (linear algebra)","summary":"In linear algebra, the trace of a square matrix A, denoted tr(A),[1] is defined to be the sum of elements on the main diagonal (from the upper left to the lower right) of A. The trace is only defined for a square matrix (n Ã— n).","image":"627945b163d7d9a1c68d59c905de5088f2e71f31.svg","url":"Trace_(linear_algebra)"}
