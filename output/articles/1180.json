{"title":"Averaging argument","summary":"In computational complexity theory and cryptography, averaging argument is a standard argument for proving theorems. It usually allows us to convert probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms into non-uniform polynomial-size circuits.","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg","url":"Averaging_argument"}
