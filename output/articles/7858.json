{"title":"Integer lattice","summary":"In mathematics, the n-dimensional integer lattice (or cubic lattice), denoted Z n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} ^{n}} , is the lattice in the Euclidean space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} whose lattice points are n-tuples of integers. The two-dimensional integer lattice is also called the square lattice, or grid lattice. Z n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} ^{n}} is the simplest example of a root lattice. The integer lattice is an odd unimodular lattice.","image":"a9b5de7ced4588982b574fe19894aec6a3ca4c49.svg","url":"Integer_lattice"}
