{"title":"Projective variety","summary":"In algebraic geometry, a projective variety over an algebraically closed field k is a subset of some projective n-space P n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} ^{n}} over k that is the zero-locus of some finite family of homogeneous polynomials of n + 1 variables with coefficients in k, that generate a prime ideal, the defining ideal of the variety. Equivalently, an algebraic variety is projective if it can be embedded as a Zariski closed subvariety of P n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} ^{n}} .","image":"7e712abd7ff167cfb12ffa7c8c9bf7b0029cf192.svg","url":"Projective_variety"}
