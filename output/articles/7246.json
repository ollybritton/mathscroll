{"title":"Hilbert modular form","summary":"In mathematics, a Hilbert modular form is a generalization of modular forms to functions of two or more variables. It is a (complex) analytic function on the m-fold product of upper half-planes H {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {H}}} satisfying a certain kind of functional equation.","image":"19ef4c7b923a5125ac91aa491838a95ee15b804f.svg","url":"Hilbert_modular_form"}
