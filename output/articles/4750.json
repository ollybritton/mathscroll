{"title":"Elliptic curve point multiplication","summary":"Elliptic curve scalar multiplication is the operation of successively adding a point along an elliptic curve to itself repeatedly.  It is used in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) as a means of producing a one-way function. The literature presents this operation as scalar multiplication, as written in Hessian form of an elliptic curve. A widespread name for this operation is also elliptic curve point multiplication, but this can convey the wrong impression of being a multiplication between two points.","image":"ECClines.svg.png.webp","url":"Elliptic_curve_point_multiplication"}
