{"title":"Copying network models","summary":"Copying network models are network generation models that use a copying mechanism to form a network, by repeatedly duplicating and mutating existing nodes of the network. Such a network model has first been proposed in 1999 to explain the network of links between web pages, but since has been used to model biological and citation networks as well.","image":"Internet_map_1024.jpg.webp","url":"Copying_network_models"}
