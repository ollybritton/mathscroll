{"title":"Hankinson's equation","summary":"Hankinson's equation (also called Hankinson's formula or Hankinson's criterion)[1] is a mathematical relationship for predicting the off-axis uniaxial compressive strength of wood.  The formula can also be used to compute the fiber stress or the stress wave velocity at the elastic limit as a function of grain angle in wood.   For a wood that has uniaxial compressive strengths of σ 0 {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{0}} parallel to the grain and σ 90 {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{90}} perpendicular to the grain, Hankinson's equation predicts that the uniaxial compressive strength of the wood in a direction at an angle α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } to the grain is given by","image":"b2f330c7d4a4ee92e5d43dfe3e23f0de3406ec78.svg","url":"Hankinson's_equation"}
