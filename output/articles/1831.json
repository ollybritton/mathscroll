{"title":"Boolean-valued model","summary":"In mathematical logic, a Boolean-valued model is a generalization of the ordinary Tarskian notion of structure from model theory. In a Boolean-valued model, the truth values of propositions are not limited to \"true\" and \"false\", but instead take values in some fixed complete Boolean algebra.","image":"ba4ee9ec435f9cc777c73dba60188b23770c3274.svg","url":"Boolean-valued_model"}
