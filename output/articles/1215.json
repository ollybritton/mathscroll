{"title":"Ax–Kochen theorem","summary":"The Ax–Kochen theorem, named for James Ax and Simon B. Kochen, states that for each positive integer d there is a finite set Yd of prime numbers, such that if p is any prime not in Yd then every homogeneous polynomial of degree d over the p-adic numbers in at least d2 + 1 variables has a nontrivial zero.[1]","image":"7867537256eafafe1f4cc394f8c2124701f412ce.svg","url":"Ax–Kochen_theorem"}
