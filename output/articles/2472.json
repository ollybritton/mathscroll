{"title":"Chang graphs","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Chang graphs are a set of three 12-regular undirected graphs, each with 28 vertices and 168 edges. They are strongly regular, with the same parameters and spectra as the line graph L(K8) of the complete graph K8.","image":"Chang_graphs.svg.png.webp","url":"Chang_graphs"}
