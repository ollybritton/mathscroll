{"title":"Contraction principle (large deviations theory)","summary":"In mathematics — specifically, in large deviations theory — the contraction principle is a theorem that states how a large deviation principle on one space \"pushes forward\" (via the pushforward of a probability measure) to a large deviation principle on another space via a continuous function.","image":"2c3860a62b2ed1428da724f69d9b8f33632a4779.svg","url":"Contraction_principle_(large_deviations_theory)"}
