{"title":"Omega and agemo subgroup","summary":"In mathematics, or more specifically group theory, the omega and agemo subgroups described the so-called \"power structure\" of a finite p-group.  They were introduced in (Hall 1933) where they were used to describe a class of finite p-groups whose structure was sufficiently similar to that of finite abelian p-groups, the so-called, regular p-groups.  The relationship between power and commutator structure forms a central theme in the modern study of p-groups, as exemplified in the work on uniformly powerful p-groups.","image":"9b95bc6e6d814ef8bedfb89a579c3fb2eeddca92.svg","url":"Omega_and_agemo_subgroup"}
