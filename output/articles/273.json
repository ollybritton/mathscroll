{"title":"Absolute Galois group","summary":"In mathematics, the absolute Galois group GK of a field K is the Galois group of Ksep over K, where Ksep is a separable closure of K. Alternatively it is the group of all automorphisms of the algebraic closure of K that fix K. The absolute Galois group is well-defined up to inner automorphism. It is a profinite group.","image":"Complex_conjugate_picture.svg.png.webp","url":"Absolute_Galois_group"}
