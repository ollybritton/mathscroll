{"title":"Semi-invariant of a quiver","summary":"In mathematics, given a quiver Q with set of vertices Q0 and set of arrows Q1, a representation of Q assigns a vector space Vi to each vertex and a linear map V(α): V(s(α)) → V(t(α)) to each arrow α, where s(α), t(α) are, respectively, the starting and the ending vertices of α. Given an element d ∈ N {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {N} } Q0, the set of representations of Q with dim Vi = d(i) for each i has a vector space structure.","image":"fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed.svg","url":"Semi-invariant_of_a_quiver"}
