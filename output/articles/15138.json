{"title":"Strip algebra","summary":"Strip Algebra is a set of elements and operators for the description of carbon nanotube structures, considered as a subgroup of polyhedra, and more precisely, of polyhedra with vertices formed by three edges. This restriction is imposed on the polyhedra because carbon nanotubes are formed of sp2 carbon atoms. Strip Algebra was developed initially [1] for the determination of the structure connecting two arbitrary nanotubes, but has also been extended to the connection of three identical nanotubes [2]","image":"a1fc04debc1b661feb94c6ab1431b75a5615b2e7.svg","url":"Strip_algebra"}
