{"title":"Mean value analysis","summary":"In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, mean value analysis (MVA) is a recursive technique for computing expected queue lengths, waiting time at queueing nodes and throughput in equilibrium for a closed separable system of queues. The first approximate techniques were published independently by Schweitzer[1] and Bard,[2][3] followed later by an exact version by Lavenberg and Reiser published in 1980.[4][5]","image":"7c025137d68b49344dec6581c37ee7737fe1ab0f.svg","url":"Mean_value_analysis"}
