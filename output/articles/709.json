{"title":"Ambient isotopy","summary":"In the mathematical subject of topology, an ambient isotopy, also called an h-isotopy, is a kind of continuous distortion of an ambient space, for example a manifold, taking a submanifold to another submanifold. For example in knot theory, one considers two knots the same if one can distort one knot into the other without breaking it. Such a distortion is an example of an ambient isotopy.  More precisely, let N {\\displaystyle N} and M {\\displaystyle M} be manifolds and g {\\displaystyle g} and h {\\displaystyle h} be embeddings of N {\\displaystyle N} in M {\\displaystyle M} .
