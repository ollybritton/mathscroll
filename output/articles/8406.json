{"title":"Jones polynomial","summary":"In the mathematical field of knot theory, the Jones polynomial is a knot polynomial discovered by Vaughan Jones in 1984.[1][2]  Specifically, it is an invariant of an oriented knot or link which assigns to each oriented knot or link a Laurent polynomial in the variable t 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle t^{1/2}} with integer coefficients.[3]","image":"ee340b8cb14ba10d3811b4a6baf1c13a20f87241.svg","url":"Jones_polynomial"}
