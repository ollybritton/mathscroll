{"title":"Girth (functional analysis)","summary":"In functional analysis, the girth of a Banach space is the infimum of lengths of centrally symmetric simple closed curves in the unit sphere of the space. Equivalently, it is twice the infimum of distances between opposite points of the sphere, as measured within the sphere.[1][2]","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Girth_(functional_analysis)"}
