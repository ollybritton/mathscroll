{"title":"Science and Hypothesis","summary":"Science and Hypothesis (French: La Science et l'Hypothèse) is a book by French mathematician Henri Poincaré, first published in 1902. Aimed at a non-specialist readership, it deals with mathematics, space, physics and nature.[1][2][3] It puts forward the theses that absolute truth in science is unattainable, and that many commonly held beliefs of scientists are held as convenient conventions rather than because they are more valid than the alternatives.[4]","image":"Poincaré-13.jpg.webp","url":"Science_and_Hypothesis"}
