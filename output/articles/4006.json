{"title":"Descriptive complexity theory","summary":"Descriptive complexity is a branch of computational complexity theory and of finite model theory that characterizes complexity classes by the type of logic needed to express the languages in them. For example, PH, the union of all complexity classes in the polynomial hierarchy, is precisely the class of languages expressible by statements of second-order logic. This connection between complexity and the logic of finite structures allows results to be transferred easily from one area to the other, facilitating new proof methods and providing additional evidence that the main complexity classes are somehow \"natural\" and not tied to the specific abstract machines used to define them.","image":"3b58241dba7058bf0e115a59e085a00d432bcce3.svg","url":"Descriptive_complexity_theory"}
