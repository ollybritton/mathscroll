{"title":"Complex Mexican hat wavelet","summary":"In applied mathematics, the complex Mexican hat wavelet is a low-oscillation, complex-valued, wavelet for the continuous wavelet transform. This wavelet is formulated in terms of its Fourier transform as the Hilbert analytic signal of the conventional Mexican hat wavelet:","image":"fb22acdf0b8444bd6baf553dbbdecad4df276652.svg","url":"Complex_Mexican_hat_wavelet"}
