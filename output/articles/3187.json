{"title":"Conformal field theory","summary":"A conformal field theory (CFT) is a quantum field theory that is invariant under conformal transformations. In two dimensions, there is an infinite-dimensional algebra of local conformal transformations, and conformal field theories can sometimes be exactly solved or classified.","image":"833e646b0dcbccac7c7220a8a26bf7a65b34e6d1.svg","url":"Conformal_field_theory"}
