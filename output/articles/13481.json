{"title":"Rhombitriheptagonal tiling","summary":"In geometry, the rhombitriheptagonal tiling is a semiregular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. At each vertex of the tiling there is one triangle and one heptagon, alternating between two squares. The tiling has Schläfli symbol rr{7, 3}.  It can be seen as constructed as a rectified triheptagonal tiling, r{7,3}, as well as an expanded heptagonal tiling or expanded order-7 triangular tiling.","image":"Rhombitriheptagonal_tiling.svg.png.webp","url":"Rhombitriheptagonal_tiling"}
