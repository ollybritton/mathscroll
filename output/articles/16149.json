{"title":"Truncated octahedral prism","summary":"In 4-dimensional geometry, a truncated octahedral prism or omnitruncated tetrahedral prism is a convex uniform 4-polytope. This 4-polytope has 16 cells (2 truncated octahedra connected by 6 cubes, 8 hexagonal prisms.) It has 64 faces (48 squares and 16 hexagons), and 96 edges and 48 vertices.","image":"CDel_node_1.png.webp","url":"Truncated_octahedral_prism"}
