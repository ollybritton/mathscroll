{"title":"Hilbert's irreducibility theorem","summary":"In number theory, Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, conceived by David Hilbert in 1892, states that every finite set of irreducible polynomials in a finite number of variables and having rational number coefficients admit a common specialization of a proper subset of the variables to rational numbers such that all the polynomials remain irreducible.  This theorem is a prominent theorem in number theory.","image":"a8b3ae112c173da6e33c912e73b974c03136728b.svg","url":"Hilbert's_irreducibility_theorem"}
