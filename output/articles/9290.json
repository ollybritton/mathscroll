{"title":"Lifting scheme","summary":"The lifting scheme is a technique for both designing wavelets and performing the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). In an implementation, it is often worthwhile to merge these steps and design the wavelet filters while performing the wavelet transform. This is then called the second-generation wavelet transform. The technique was introduced by Wim Sweldens.[1]","image":"Second_generation_wavelet_transform.svg.png.webp","url":"Lifting_scheme"}
