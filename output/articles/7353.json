{"title":"Homogeneous coordinates","summary":"In mathematics, homogeneous coordinates or projective coordinates, introduced by August Ferdinand MÃ¶bius in his 1827 work Der barycentrische Calcul,[1][2][3] are a system of coordinates used in projective geometry, just as Cartesian coordinates are used in Euclidean geometry. They have the advantage that the coordinates of points, including points at infinity, can be represented using finite coordinates. Formulas involving homogeneous coordinates are often simpler and more symmetric than their Cartesian counterparts. Homogeneous coordinates have a range of applications, including computer graphics and 3D computer vision, where they allow affine transformations and, in general, projective transformations to be easily represented by a matrix.","image":"RationalBezier2D.svg.png.webp","url":"Homogeneous_coordinates"}
