{"title":"Conjugate diameters","summary":"In geometry, two diameters of a conic section are said to be conjugate if each chord parallel to one diameter is bisected by the other diameter.  For example, two diameters of a circle are conjugate if and only if they are perpendicular.","image":"Conjugate_Diameters.svg.png.webp","url":"Conjugate_diameters"}
