{"title":"Riemann–Hurwitz formula","summary":"In mathematics, the Riemann–Hurwitz formula, named after Bernhard Riemann and Adolf Hurwitz, describes the relationship of the Euler characteristics of two surfaces when one is a ramified covering of the other. It therefore connects ramification with algebraic topology, in this case. It is a prototype result for many others, and is often applied in the theory of Riemann surfaces (which is its origin) and algebraic curves.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Riemann–Hurwitz_formula"}
