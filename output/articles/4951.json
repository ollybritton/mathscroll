{"title":"Erdős–Gallai theorem","summary":"The Erdős–Gallai theorem is a result in graph theory, a branch of combinatorial mathematics. It provides one of two known approaches to solving the graph realization problem, i.e. it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite sequence of natural numbers to be the degree sequence of a simple graph. A sequence obeying these conditions is called \"graphic\". The theorem was published in 1960 by Paul Erdős and Tibor Gallai, after whom it is named.","image":"bf420b33c4889040579ca7581e475d3f32b5e9e2.svg","url":"Erdős–Gallai_theorem"}
