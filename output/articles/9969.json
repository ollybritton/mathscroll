{"title":"Markov chain central limit theorem","summary":"In the mathematical theory of random processes, the Markov chain central limit theorem has a conclusion somewhat similar in form to that of the classic central limit theorem (CLT) of probability theory, but the quantity in the role taken by the variance in the classic CLT has a more complicated definition. See also the general form of Bienaym√©'s identity.","image":"26f306941d2cccf22bdb5bd6ff4032f636cce056.svg","url":"Markov_chain_central_limit_theorem"}
