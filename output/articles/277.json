{"title":"Absolute geometry","summary":"Absolute geometry is a geometry based on an axiom system for Euclidean geometry without the parallel postulate or any of its alternatives. Traditionally, this has meant using only the first four of Euclid's postulates, but since these are not sufficient as a basis of Euclidean geometry, other systems, such as  Hilbert's axioms without the parallel axiom, are used.[1] The term was introduced by JÃ¡nos Bolyai in 1832.[2] It is sometimes referred to as neutral geometry,[3] as it is neutral with respect to the parallel postulate.","image":"Stereographic_projection_in_3D.svg.png.webp","url":"Absolute_geometry"}
