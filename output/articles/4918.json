{"title":"Equilateral polygon","summary":"In geometry, an equilateral polygon is a polygon which has all sides of the same length. Except in the triangle case, an equilateral polygon does not need to also be equiangular (have all angles equal), but if it does then it is a regular polygon. If the number of sides is at least five, an equilateral polygon does not need to be a convex polygon: it could be concave or even self-intersecting.","image":"5-gon_equilateral_01.svg.png.webp","url":"Equilateral_polygon"}
