{"title":"Pappus graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Pappus graph is a bipartite 3-regular undirected graph with 18 vertices and 27 edges, formed as the Levi graph of the Pappus configuration.[1] It is named after Pappus of Alexandria, an ancient Greek mathematician who is believed to have discovered the \"hexagon theorem\" describing the Pappus configuration. All the cubic distance-regular graphs are known; the Pappus graph is one of the 13 such graphs.[2]","image":"Pappus_graph_LS.svg.png.webp","url":"Pappus_graph"}
