{"title":"First-player and second-player win","summary":"In combinatorial game theory, a two-player deterministic perfect information turn-based game is a first-player-win if with perfect play the first player to move can always force a win. Similarly, a game is second-player-win if with perfect play the second player to move can always force a win. With perfect play, if neither side can force a win, the game is a draw.","image":"Tictactoe-X.svg.png.webp","url":"First-player_and_second-player_win"}
