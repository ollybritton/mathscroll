{"title":"Symplectomorphism","summary":"In mathematics, a symplectomorphism or symplectic map is an isomorphism in the category of symplectic manifolds. In classical mechanics, a symplectomorphism represents a transformation of phase space that is volume-preserving and preserves the symplectic structure of phase space, and is called a canonical transformation.","image":"f14c407b33ec76d906a43332a3bb7e2942999e1f.svg","url":"Symplectomorphism"}
